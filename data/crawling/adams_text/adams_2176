Dear sir
Bourdeaux January 31. <1778> 1780



Since my Arrival at this Place, which was the day before Yesterday, I had the <Honour> Pleasure of receiving a Letter from you, dated Alicante January 8. 1780,1 informing me that you had desired your Bankers D. Pedro Casamayor & Co, to wait on me at Madrid, and make me a Tender of what Money I might have Occasion for. At the same Time I received a Letter from the House of D. Pedro Casamayor [315]& Co, offering me every Assistance in their Power, particularly as much Money as I should have Occasion for, either on the Account of your House or another, which had done me the favour to write a Similar Letter to the same Banker.2
You will be pleased to accept of my Thanks which are the only return I can make you, for this Instance of your Politeness to me, and your generous Attachment to the Honour of the united states. I had the strongest Inclination to go to Madrid, for the Pleasure of seeing that <fine><noble> City, but it would have delayed my Journey to Paris by 15 or 20 days at least, for which Reason as well as Some others, I did not know how it might be taken by Congress or by the Court of Spain: I therefore concluded it, Safest to pursue my Route to Paris. I have not had Occasion, to make Use of the Credit, you was so kind as to offer me: but am not the less obliged to you, for the offer. I am with great Respect, Sir, your most obedient, and obliged, humble servant
