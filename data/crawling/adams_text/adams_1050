Sir
Camp at Wilmington Sept. 4th, 1777



Yesterday a severe skirmish happened between a party of seven hundred of our Troops and two or three thousand Barbarians, it is said we lost forty or fifty and the Enemy more, but the superiority of their numbers obliged our men to retreat;1 the Enemy advanced and are now encamped three or four miles below Christiana Bridge,2 with the greatest part of their Troops. These accounts I receive from others, being so much engaged to complete if possible the muster of the Army for this month before action comes on, that I have not had time to reconnoitre any since the Enemy landed. It gives me pain that so much of the Country between the Enemy and us is exposed to their ravages, but I confide in the wisdom of the General and conclude there is no ground near where they landed proper for us to make a stand; the ground where our Army is now posted is very good, and I hope we shall defend it with a spirit becoming our Cause. I am apprehensive the Enemy will bring some of their large Ships up the River to fecilitate their approach to this place, as they may annoy the Town from their Ships and not be exposed to our fire but very little, we having no heavy Cannon nor Mortars. The spirit of the Army and Militia appears well at present, and I conceive we have an animating prospect of success, but the events of war are always uncertain, and the confident hopes of men have so often been blasted that we ought to provide for a defeat, while at the same time we are determined through God to do valiantly.
I am sorry that there should be any occasion to enquire into [280]the conduct of Genl. Sullivan, but hope and believe his conduct will bear examination.3 I conjecture there will be no time for Courts Martial to try Generals until this Campaign is over.
I am waiting for the Returns from the Northward to complete my General Abstract of Musters taken to the first of August. I am Sir Your most Obedient Humble Servant

Joseph Ward
