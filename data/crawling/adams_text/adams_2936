Sir
Philada. Decr. 12. 1780



In Addition to other Papers1 respecting your Ministration I now forward an Act of Congress of this day.
You know that it has been much if not intirely the Practice of the Comtee. of foreign Affairs to let the Resolves which they transmit speak for themselves. In the present Case however there is no danger of a too warm Expression of the Satisfaction of Congress even if, in performing singly the Duty of our whole Committee, I should write in the approving Language of a personally affectionate and very partial Friend.

James Lovell for the Comtee. of forgn. Affrs.
