Gentlemen
The Hague, 16 January 1779



I know that you received my letters of 2 and 8 December. Since then, I have had the honor of writing you three more, dated 1824 December, 13 January, and 1215 January.
Yesterday, the 15th, in the evening, just as I was sending off my last, the French Ambassador sought me out in order to have me meet with our friend to confirm, on the Ambassadors behalf, that this morning he will present a mmoire to the President of Their High Mightinesses together with the Kings new order excluding the commerce and naviga-[359]tion of the Republic, excepting only that under the flag of Amsterdam, from the favors that France permits neutrals to enjoy at sea and in its ports1 and will, although it is contrary to custom, afterwards make the rounds of the town halls of all the towns of Holland in order to express to their respective pensionaries the regret and repugnance of the King at being forced by them to issue the said order.
I waited at the Embassy until two in the morning to give the Ambassador, who was dining elsewhere, our friends answer. The same night he sent an express to his Court, and this morning I hold myself in readiness to report, on his behalf, to our friend on what happened.
