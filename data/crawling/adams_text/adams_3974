Sir
Amsterdam, 30 May 1782



Although we have done everything possible to try to find someone who wants to take over the house that we, in our capacity, had the honor to rent to your excellency,1 we had not found anyone until now. But, since they only want to pay f 1,200 in rent per year, we have not dared to agree to it without your excellencys consent, considering the loss that will result from it. We very humbly ask that your excellency honor us with a short reply to guide us.2
We have the honor to be with the greatest consideration and the deepest respect, sir, your excellencys very humble and very obedient servants
