Dr Sir
Bruxelles, Augt. 27 1780



As you desire in yours of the 23. I now send you the Packet and least the English mail should be detaind by the wind from you as it has been here I send you the contents of a letter from Mr. Stephens Secratary of the Admiralty to LLoyds Coffee House for the information of the Merchantswhich is dated the 22 instant.1
[94]
Mr. Stephens says he has received a letter dated Augt. 9. from the Capt. of the Thetis Frigate who in company with the Ramillies was convoy[ing?] the West India fleet of 54 Sail with Genl. Rainsfords Regiment on [...] 25 East India Men, which informs him that in the evening of [the?] 8th in Lat: 36.40 and Longit: 15 West, they unfortunately fell in with the United fleet from Cadiz and he feard that almost the whole convoy had fallen into the Enemys hands. This I hope is only the begining of good News.
Tis certain that Congress has not paid that attention to the Dutch that they merited, or that the interest of America requird; and it is not a little unfortunate that other powers have been treated with the same neglect, since it is more than probable that at this period, by proper management, a general acknowlegement [of our] Independence might be obtaind, which would in a great [mea]sure remove the principal objection that the Enemy [preten]d to have against making Peace. For my own part, I coud [wish to] see Portugal treated as she deserves, by all the United Powers [declar]ing War upon her, when she coud not do us half the injury [that] she does now under the flimsy pretext of Neutrality.
Be pleased to send me, if you can procure them, the particulars of the plan, by which St. Thomass is constituted a Free Port.
Our best Compliments attend your Sons and I have the Honor to remain with very high respect Dear Sir Your most Obliged & Obedt. Hble Servt.

W. Lee
