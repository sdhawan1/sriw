Gentlemen
Passy Augt. 6th. 1778



By a resolve of Congress1 the Seamen who engaged to Serve in the Ranger under my Command were furnished Individually with forty Dollars, the Landsmen with Twenty Dollars Advance [353]in Continental Bills at the time of Entry. They have Also been supplyed with Slops from time to time to a considerable Amount. And they received a small Advance in Cash from my hands at Nantes last Winter.
I conceive it to be my Duty to represent these circumstances to you, And I naturally hope that you will Order recipts to be given to me for my indemnification, And that my Stores, and furniture &ca. be delivered up.
I beg you to recommend the Men who landed with me at Whitehaven to the Bounty of Congress Agreeable to your promise, and I have the Honor to be with Sentiments of due Esteem & Respect Gentlemen Your very Obliged very Obedient very humble Servant,

Jno P Jones
