Dear Sir,
Paris 5th. July 1784



I intended to have written to you some posts ago, But I found that a few of your things had been lockd up in a Chamber at Auteuil, and left there with some matters belonging to Mrs. Barclay, and that they had Escaped her Memory and My knowledge. There are Two Coats and 2 laced hats belonging to your servants1 lamp to write by with 2 Ink stands, a Coat of Arms in a Frame, 2 wooden stands for your wigs, and a small paper Box with powder, Also a little Box directed for Madam Dumas, These things shoud Certainly have been sent with the others had I known of them, and I shall have them Conveyd to you some how or other Very soon Inclosed I send you three Receipts for the Bills of Exchange, If you prefer any other form let me know, and it shall be adherd to I have been Very Buissy for some time, and if you Chuse that a settlement of your Account shall be Stated for your Consideration I will attempt to make one. I think I Can form one to your Satisfaction as far as up to the time of your sending me the papers in Paris, and I will Endeavor to take as much of the Trouble off your hands as possible
There are two Kinds of people with whom I have occasion to settle the Public Accounts, Those who wish to Introduce Every thing possible into them, and those who are Rigidly scrupulous to Charge any thing, lest it might have the Appearance of being wrongand I suspect very much that You are among the last mentiond Class
I Beg you will present My best wishes to your son, and M. Dumass Family, and Beleiv me / Sincerely / Dear Sir / Your Affectionate / & Obedient servant

Thos Barclay
