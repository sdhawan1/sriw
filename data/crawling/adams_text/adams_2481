Paris, 20 May 1780. RC partly in John Thaxters hand (PCC, No. 84, II, f. 63 69). LbC partly in Thaxters hand (Adams Papers).
In the recipients copy the account of Conways speech is in John Adams hand, while the criticism of the speech is in Thaxters. In the Letterbook the portions by Thaxter and Adams are reversed. printed: Wharton, ed., Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev., 3:691 693. This letter was read in Congress on 11 September. Due to the capture of the packet bringing the London newspapers to the continent, John Adams provided a retranslation of the text of Gen. Conways speech of 5 May as it appeared in the Gazette de La Haye and followed it with a lengthy analysis. For a virtually identical text of Adams rebuttal to that part of Conways speech attacking the Franco-American alliance, see Adams letter of 17 May to Edm Jacques Genet, and notes (above).
