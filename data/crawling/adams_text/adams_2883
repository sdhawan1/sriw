Sir
Leyden, 14 November 1780



I am very sorry that the publication of the pamphlet has been so long delayed, first by the refusal of the bookseller to whom I had sent it and on whom I had counted, and then by the continual delays of the printer. Now it is finally done, and I have the honor to send to you the two enclosed copies.1 I have requested a dozen free for your use2 and I will send another ten by the Barque Marchande. If you need more, please let me know.
Dare I ask you to pay my very humble respects to Mr. Searle and, if the opportunity presents itself, to Mr. Dumas, and at the same time to be [343]persuaded of all the sentiments with which I have the honor to be, sir, your excellencys most humble and most obedient servant.

J: Luzac
