Dear Sir

        21st. PM [December 1777]
       



After the Resolve for stopping Burgoyne had passed,1 some were of opinion that a State of Facts found by the Committee2 should have preceeded the reasoning. Perhaps you will judge that it is already too laboured a report.
I inclose for your own use the State of Facts alluded to which did not enter into the business of Congress; but was only talked of.
We have intelligence now that 2 Hoits [Howitzers] were thrown into a river; and it is declared that Carleton has scourged some of the returned Canadians to make them take up arms.
Tho the Paper containing the affidavits of a prisoner is in Form with its oath yet I cannot myself believe the Savages eat our Flesh.3 Adieu,

J L


I could not get any Resolves passed so as to answer Mr. Izards letter4 but will be diligent to do it soon.
