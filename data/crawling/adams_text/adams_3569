Amsterdam 13 December 1781. RC in John Thaxters hand (PCC, No. 84, III, f. 426429). printed: Wharton, ed., Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev., 5:4344. This letter, read in Congress on 15 March 1782 and acted upon on 26 March (JCC, 22:150), contained the English text of Lord Stormonts acceptance of Russias mediation of the Anglo-Dutch war. Formulated in early September, Stormonts answer to I. M. Simolin, the Russian minister, reversed Britains refusal, in March, of Russias first mediation offer and proceeded from the joint representations made at the end of August by the Russian, Swedish, and Danish ministers in London (to the president of Congress, 6 Aug., 1st letter, calendared, vol. 11:440). In his acceptance, Stormont recited British grievances against the Netherlands, but pointedly rejected any Swedish or Danish role in the mediation. He did so to avoid legitimizing the League of Armed Neutrality, the Dutch accession to which was the real, if unstated, reason for Britains declaration of war against the Netherlands. Stormont did not inform the Russian minister of Britains terms for reaching a settlement. Those were sent to St. Petersburg by a separate courier and included provisions requiring the Dutch to provide financial assistance in the war against France and cease the sale of munitions and naval stores to Britains enemies (from Jean de Neufville, 2 March, note 2 and references there, vol. 11:172173; De Madariaga, Armed Neutrality of 1780, p.337340, 346351).
