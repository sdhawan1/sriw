On 13 June the Representatives heard the Councils address to Hutchinson which reiterated the determination of the House to conduct no business in Cambridge (same, p. 3236). Hutchinsons reply to the Council reaffirmed his position and was presented to the House on 15 June. The committee described above was then named to prepare a message to the Lieutenant Governor restating the lower chambers decision not to enter upon Business out of the Town of Boston and adding the prayer that if Hutchinson was determined not to remove the Assembly there, he would be pleased to give Leave to the Members to retire to their respective Homes (same, p. 37). Upon the adoption of the report, JA was named to the committee which delivered the message to Hutchinson. It was not until 25 June, however, that Hutchinson recessed the intransigent legislators (same, p. 38, 47).
