The happy moment is now arrived, the strugle is at an end. America is recognizsed free & independent States: I congratulate you on this important period I feel myself riseing from that state of dejection, wch always attends uncertain prospects, of great & very interesting eventsso far, so wellbut all is not completed, tho all in a fair way Its with pleasure I feel myself unshackeld, & may write an innocent line to a Friend, without hazarding a suspicion or being chargeable with criminal intentions; Ive often resolved, & as often [145]been deterd from this consideration to write you. the obstruction is now removed
This is a very fine Country, it wanted nothing to complete its happiness, or rather for the continuation of it but political wisdom. O pity! pity!
What an excellent School is Europe! from hence America, without centuries of dear bought experiences, & gropeing in the dark, may at once learn how to direct her riseing empire I am anxious to know the result of the present negatiation, whether peace or more war, & shall be happy to have a line from you, & if its proper to be favord wh your Opinion, youre near the light, & your Opinion is of great weight with me My health every since Ive been here, has been very indifferentbut like the times its now mending
