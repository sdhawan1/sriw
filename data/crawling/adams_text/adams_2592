Paris, 6 July 1780. Dupl, both text and signature in John Thaxters hand (PCC, No. 84, II, f. 165171). printed: Wharton, ed., Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev., 3:833 837.
This letter, received by Congress on 19 Feb. 1781 (JCC, 19:174 175), includes a list, taken from the Courier de lEurope of 27 June, of vessels captured or destroyed by all belligerents since the beginning of the war. Lamenting the loss of so many American naval vessels, Adams urged Congress to give great Attention to their Navy; to the Augmentation of Ships; the Multiplication of Seamen; the Improvement of Discipline and the formation of Officers. It was necessary that Congress take such action and Americans cherish their own Navy, because no other Nation would grieve very much at the total destruction of it, before the Conclusion of a Peace. I am sorry to say this, but I have heard such Hints as convince me that it is my Duty to put Congress on their Guard, and to intreat them to leave nothing unattempted to put their Marine upon the best footing in their Power.
