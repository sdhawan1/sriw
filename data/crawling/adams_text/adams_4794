Sir
London Decr: 14th: 1783.


The Day before Yesterday, Mr: Boudinot called upon me, with Dispatches from the President of Congress, his Brother. There were two Letters addressed to the Ministers and these I opened but found little or Nothing but Duplicates of Dispatches, receivd by you before I left Auteuil.
There are two letters, and one large Packet addressed to you, which I have the Honour to transmit by Mr: Little page.
Mr: Jay and I are waiting, for Advices from your Excellency. if this Packet or that by Captn: Jones contains a Commission to treat with Great Britain, it will be necessary that we should return, to Paris, or that you should come to London very soon I am also very anxious to hear whether it is possible for you to Save Mr: Morriss Bills at Amsterdam from a Protest for Non payment.1 If it is not, many Individuals will be disappointed, and the Catastrophe to American Credit must come on.
With the greatest Respect, I have the Honour to be, Sir, your / Most obedt:
