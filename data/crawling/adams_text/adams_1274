Gentlemen
Challiet May 17th 1778



Being too much indisposd to come to Passi this morning, and thinking the subjects of the enclosd Letters of pressing importance; I have sent you what I think shoud be written. You will make such Alterations as you think proper.1 But if the subordinate Servants of the public continue to obey or not obey our Orders as they pleaseto act as they will, without taking our ordersto involve us in debt at their pleasureand give us no account of the expenditure of large Sums of public money committed to themwe may expect the worst consequences both to the public and ourselves. I have the honor to be with the greatest esteem Gentlemen yr. most Obedt. Servt.
