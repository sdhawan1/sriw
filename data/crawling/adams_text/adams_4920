Dear Sir
Chaillot near Paris 27 Ap. 1784



Your Favr. of the 20th. Inst. arrived last Evening It is not in pursuance of a recent or hasty Resolution, that I am preparing to return: It has been long taken & maturely considered. the public Accounts still detain me, for tho always kept by Mr Carmichael, I do not chuse to leave them unsettled behind me when that Obstacle ceases, which I expect will be very soon, I shall leave Paris. I daily expect Answers to Letters by which I desired a Friend in London to enquire & inform me about a New York vessel there. it is probable I may go in her, if not, I must look out for some other opportunity.
There are Accounts of Barneys Arrival perhaps he may be sent back with the Papers you mention if so, we may soon see him, and in that Case I would return with him.
The coming of your family will be a great Consolation to you & them may you have a speedy & happy meeting. I wish they had made you a visit immediately on the Return of Peace; & in this wish Mrs. Jay sincerely joins. would it be very inconvenient to you to come to Paris? I cannot propose that you should leave any thing undone, which ought to be donebut if there be no Objection of
[179]
that Sort, a Trip to Paris would not be an unpleasant Excursion. who knows but that you might meet the Commission hereif not, you will certainly meet a cordial welcome from / Dear Sir / Your Friend & Servt

John Jay
