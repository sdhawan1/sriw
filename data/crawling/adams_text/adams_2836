Any that you do not wish to keep may be freely returned to Mr. Mandrillon.16
In two weeks I plan to come to Amsterdam and have the honor of meeting you and presenting my respects. Having been born Swiss, and therefore raised in perfect freedom, and lived for the last forty years or so in this free country (although not quite so free as Switzerland), I am naturally drawn to people so gloriously engaged in seeking their independence as are you Americans. May the Lord who created us all free be kind and bestow on you courage, strength, and his benediction in your just war against tyrants enabling you to vanquish them with their glory and ambition. I shall always hear such news with the greatest of pleasure and please believe in the complete sincerity of a free man offering you his services, sir, your very humble and obedient servant,

B. Wild
