Dear Sir
Newburyport April 6th. 1784



By my friend Jona Jackson Esqr. who sailed for Ireland and England in Decer last, I did myself the pleasure of writing you fully, under date of the 5th of that month; and on the 26th I had the honor of receiving your Favors of the 8th Septemr preceding Accept my sincere thanks for the confidential advice therein contained; which has been prudently, & I think very beneficially, communicated1
Our mutual friend Mr Cranch has forwarded me the two pamphlets, in which Lord Richmond shews a Candor and Openness of opinion, as to the inherent Rights of the people, notwithstanding the Mists & Prejudices of Education and Rank, that few of his Peers will approve of, so far as to put it in practice.2 Such influence has the Crown, by means of the reveue laws; and the Nobility, by their important place in the present Government of G B., that it is probable the British Nation, as such, would be ruined, er so thorough
[111]
a reform, as is proposed by Richmond, can be adopted Our last Advices from Ireland, which indeed are old, do not promise so complete a Reformation in that Kingdom as might be wished
To leave the almost ruined Kingdom of England, and the expected new one of Ireland, permit me to give you some Account of the State of Politics in this Commonwealth: which I undertake with great diffidence, hoping some abler pen may afford you such advise respectg our public affairs, as you must wish to receive; but which, I find, by former letters, has not been communicated in season
The General Court of this Commonwealth, after a session of more than nine weeks, was prorogued the 25th March, to the last Tuesday in May Much public business has been passed on by them in their present sittingand some very important business omitted, or referred
The definitive Treaty was communicated by the Governor, with the (enclosed) recommendations of Congress A Committee of both Houses, consisting of Eleven, were immediately appointed to take the same into Consideration, and reportof which Committee the Hnble President of the Senate, and your hble Servant were members.3
We sit twelve Eveningsand spent the time very industriously & attentively on the important Subject The Result of the Committee you have in their report enclosed, which Report, by no means, pleased the President, being too liberal; and, as youll see, by the minutes thereon, was proposed by the Senate to be referred to the next Session4 to this reference the House would not agree; neither would the House accept the report; rather owing to two Gentlemen, who had been of the Comee; wandring from the Question, & pressing their arguments for a singular opinion viz. that the Absentees, exceptg such as are mentioned in the fifth Article of the Treaty, had an optional right to become Citizens of the United States, or to remain the Subjects of G Britain The passions of the Members were raised so high, on this doctrines being advanced, that they overlooked the plain purport of the report under Consideration, and rejected it. Nay,so irritated were They, that when a Quire of printed hand bills, similar to one enclosed, of the doings of the Town of New Haven, were laid on the Table, by the Messenger, delivered him by a Printers Devil, he was instantly orderd to take the Person, who delivered them to him, into custody; but not being to be found, the Papers were orderd to be hove in the fire5
[112]
The House, sensible of the necessity of acting on the Subject, chose a Comee of seven, of their own Body, to take all the papers, relative to the Treaty, into consideration, and report Copy of their report is herein enclosed for your perusal This report the Senate proposed also to refer this produced a Comee of Conference, and that Comee, reported a bill, which you have also herein enclosed, as it passed into an Act6 This Step was as far as I supposed possible to be taken at present, and is as far as, I beleive, any State has taken I shall be happy to find it meets your approbation The furthest, I presume, that may be taken is to restore those Estates which may have been confiscated, and not sold
Various Constructions are made of the 5th & 6th Articles of the Treaty The two Gentlemen aforementioned are to the extent of the liberal; while, on the other extreem, some hold that the 5th Article only relates to the Absentees, and the sixth, in the whole, to those, only, who remained as residents in the United States I sincerely wish that such measures may be finally adopted by the several States, as may entitle their Decisions to the Approbation of disinterested Men, and dispassionate Posterity7
I am well pleased to find that you and Mr Jay are in the Comission for settling the commercial Treaty with G Britain, & hope it will be extended to those with the several powers of Europe8
My endeavours have been used to awaken the attention of Persons of influence in New Hampshire, to this important objectand I have corresponded with Mr Gerry, now at Congress, thereon He writes me under the first of March 84 that by outlines of a plan before Congress, for arranging our foreign Concerns, including those of Commercegeneral principles are laid down which will prevent foreign Nations from taking Advantages, more especially of the Carrying Tradeand the business is by the report put into the hands of Messs Adams Franklin & Jay indeed if the measures we have proposed in the Report should be adopted, our Commerce will be on the most extensive liberal and advantageous Footing Doctor Franklin has, I think, without proper Authority, enterd on Negotiations, by virtue of obsolete Powers, (as they appear to me) issued soon after his first arrival as a Comissioner in Europe He has formed a Treaty with Sweden, and it is ratified, but I am apt to think you will not see any more effects of his seperate Negotiations I am sure you will not with my consent9
The Commonwealth of Virginia, whose Interest it undoubtedly is to admit, without distinction, all Nations to carry her produce,
[113]
having but little Navigation belonging to their Citizens, has passed an Act, granting Congress such powers as to enable that Body to counteract the unjustifiable Proclamation of the King of G Britainor the effects of any Acts of his Parliament which may be particularly levelled at the destruction of the Trade of these States which Act they forwarded to the several Governments, recommending similar Laws to be passed, on which Condition theirs is to take placeSuch jealousy unhappily prevails, in this State, against additional Powers being granted to Congress, that a like bill, with that of Virginia, reported by a Comee of both Houses, was referred to the next Session of the G Court when I hope it may passfor if full powers of regulating our Commerce with foreign Nations, is not given to Congress, the Trade of the several States will soon be in a distracted Situation& the sole benefit of it reaped by foreigners there may be no occasion of granting adequate, perpetual, Powersbut they should have such powers as are sufficienttho they may be limited as to time, untill Tryal is made, when, if approved of, they may be engrafted into the Confederation, or discontinuedor others adopted in their room10
It is with much concern that I am obligd to repeat the melancholy account of the situation of our public Funds in my former letters I have troubled you with my sentiments, and have no better intelligence to give, at this time, on the Subject
The general Impost, required by Congress, has been adopted in some States in the wholeby others in part some have not passed on it,& One or two have rejected itwhile not any general System, for supplying the foederal Chest, is mentioned by any State A Jealousy gains ground to the Northward that the Monies will not be properly applied the Office of Financier is reprobated, & Instructions given to the Delegates of this State to endeavour an abolition of it, and an institution of a Board of Treasury, annually to be chosenfrom different Statesand by rotation No appearance of settling the public Accounts, on which this Government supose they are greatly in advance A very large Sum of old Emission Money in our Treasury, and in the hands of Individuals, beside redeeming our full Share of it, for the redemption of which surplus in our possession, no provision is likely to be madean entire Silence as to reimbursing the enormous debt incurred in the Penobscot Expeditionare Matters so important that, unless they are settled, will prevent any further Grants or Supplies to Congress Nay I suspect may cause a Stop in the payment of any more of the 400,000 heretofore
[114]
granted, of which only 91,000 is yet paid to the Receiver General, & this is more than any other State has paid, in proportion. What must be the End of this? As I hinted in my last a party seem disposed to heave all into confusion, that their deep laid plans may take place another party, thorough Republicans, say that this is the time to make a stand, and that the virtues and good sense of the People are so general, that it is possible such measures may be now taken as to prevent the ills of trusting the Aristocratical party with more power, and to place our Union on a stable Basis11
How much farther can Congress proceed without the public Chests being supplied? where will be our Faithour Credit? The Several States might raise their proportions of public Charges in their own way, and with ease, saving thereby their full independence this neglected, such power must finally be given to Congress, to save the whole, as may be repented of when too late. It appears to me impossible that the U States can continue long, as such, in this unsettled Situation The Powers of Europe will see & take advantage of it
Neither has this General Court provided for any revennue to supply their own Treasury. The Country Gentlemen insist that their Constituents cannot bear any more Taxes than are now laid on themand want to adopt Excises and Duties on every article consumed by the People in the lower Towns this not being agreed to, nothing was done to supply the Treasurynor is any money now coming in to pay the Interest of our own consolidated Notes, except what arises from an Impost, and a partial excise which leave a great deficiency this Neglect in the Legislature occasioned the State Securities to fall 10 per Cent A little more dear bought experience may bring us to some consistent Conduct or our Independence will prove a Curse instead of a Blessing
In the enclosed Gazette You have the report of a Committee on the Order of the Cincinnatiwhich was unanimously accepted by the House12 Pay the Officers and this Order will be harmless, but if persecution is added to Injustice, in withholding their righteous demands, They may, joyned to other Malcontents, become formidable The Commutation with the Officersand the Impost granted to Congress, cause a few County Meetings, but I beleive they will prove of no great Consequence
I have not had the happiness of seeing Mr Dana since his return from Europetho I have the pleasure of acquainting you that he
[115]
has been unanimously elected a Delegate to Congressagreeably to your wishesand proceed As soon as his health will permithaving been very unwell since his return to America.
Difference in Sentiments arises between the British in Nova Scotia, and this Governmtas to the Branch of the River St Croix, designed in the treaty of Peace We claim the most Eastern They the more Western. permit me to ask whither any fixed certain Branch, & which, if either, was precisely ascertained by the Commissioners I am told a No Line drawn from the Branch claimed by the British will not strike the High Land mentioned in the TreatyThis Matter must be settled and may probably be agitated at the next session of the G Court. I should be happy to know your Sentiments thereon13
This Government is renewing their Claims to Lands, Westward of Hudsons River, not so much with an intent of settling as of ceding them to Congress; New York being disposed to compromise with Congress, by Cession of a part, reserving a handsome Share to themselves: which they are now granting to Settlers on easy TermsThe report of a former Committee on the Subject has been before the Court, and I think is in your hand writing14
Many Affairs of great importance to each Stateand to the U States are before them respectivelyYour Assistance is much wanted: tho I acquiesce in your continued Absence, as it must be more beneficial to the wholenotwithstanding it deprives me a longer time of the honour of your Company to a Saturday dinner, which you were so kind as to promise me, in a former Letter15
Speaking of a Saltfish Dinner, reminds me of the rapid Settlement making at Port Roseway in N Scotiaand the Attempts to rob us of the Whale Fishery If the Alien Duty on Oyle is imposed by Britain, on that catched in Vessels, owned by Citizens of this State, it will infallibly transplant the People of Nantucket to Nova ScotiaI dont doubt you are so fully sensible of this danger as to avert it if possible I confess that the danger of losing so benificial and necessary a branch of business alarms me16
You will pardon my imperfect Intelligence, on account of the desire I have to render you any agreeable Serviceand permit me to hope such return of advice as you may think of Consequence
I have taken my leave of the Chair, as Speaker of the House, it being too great a Confinement for my healthand for my private Businesssix months nearly of the past year having been employed
[116]
in that Station I may be in the G Court the ensuing year, in some Capacity, being anxious to afford my poor assistance, at this critical time17
Shall I ask the favor of your offering my most respectful Compliments to Mr Jay And his Ladywith Whom I had the Honor of dining at Philada, when He was President of Congress
My best Wishes and most sincere regards ever attend yourselfbeing with all sincerity / Dear Sir / Your affectionate Friend / and most Obt hble Servt

Tristram Dalton
