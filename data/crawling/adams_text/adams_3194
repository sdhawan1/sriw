Honourd Sir
Amsterdam 21 March 1781



May it not displease yor Excellency that by this present we ttch upon the unhappy afair of St. Estacia, we do realy pity them who will be loosers thereby, as it will be a terrible stroke and rin many people, thank heaven or own loss and that of or frinds can not be by farr so great in this moment then it could have been; and we would willingly have sacrificd a mch larger Smm in Case we could have prevented this generall Calamity, which by all probability should not have happend, if as the stronger Tories confess them Selfs or Navy had been sooner in a better order as it could and ought to have been.
[225]
Yor Excellency will certainly be informed that Coll. Lawrence Arrived in Erope. We heard it by some of or American Letters that came over in the same Vessell, and that a greater force was raised in America so as to act offensively which gave s great pleasre.
May all those tidings inflence or Loan, and rise the Spirits of the Dtch, so as not to be seduced to an entire ignominy.
With all respectfll regard We have the honor to be Honourd Sir, Yor Excellencys most devoted and most Obedient hmble Servants

John de Neufville & Son
