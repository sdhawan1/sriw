Sir,
Passy, June 27. 1784.



Inclosed I have the Honour of sending to your Excellency Copies of Papers containd in a Dispatch just receivd from Congress. The Affair of the Free-Ports recommended to us, has been someTime settled: They are Dunkirk, LOrient, Bayonne & Marseilles.1
I wonder much that we hear nothing from Congress of their
[254]
foreign Arrangements. This short Line from the President is the only one I have receivd since that of Jan. 14. which accompanied the Ratification.2
With great Respect I have the Honour to be, / Sir, / Your most obedient / & most humble Servant

B. Franklin
