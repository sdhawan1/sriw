Chaillot 7th. Augst. 1778



Mr. Lees compliments to Mr. Adams. Mr. Lee has over and over again written to Mr. Williams that the Letters shoud be delivered to him whenever he chose to call, At Mr. Lees house and receive them, which he has refused in very indecent terms. It is this and this only that has prevented him from having them, for <I have> Mr. Lee has constantly left them out to be delivered to him when <I> He went out <myself> himself nor has he furnished any one of those things that <I have> Mr. Lee has required of him for near two months relative to the public accounts. He seems to <me> him to be making experiments how much he can provoke <me> him by every impertinence he can devise.1
