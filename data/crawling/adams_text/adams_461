Sir
Camp at Roxbury Novr. 1. 1775



I wrote you some time since the Gentlemen of the Committee from the Congress and presumed to trouble you once more on the Account of the Hospital at Roxbury.
When I had the command last Spring att this place it was found Necessary to Establish a Hospital here. I Applyd to the Provincial Congress on the matter and was by them desird to Establish One. I Accordingly took the House on Jamaica Plains, where Commadore Loring formerly lived1 and Doctor Warren Appointed Doctor AspinwallA Gentleman regularly educated in the Profession, as Surgeon of said Hospital, who has conducted Extreamly Well, and I am ceartain this Hospital is under <better> the best regulation of any in either Camp, and I understand he is not Provided for. Now if tis Consistant I could freely recommend him for some imployment in that Way, as I am certain no one woud give better Satisfaction in this department. I am Sir with Very great respect, Yr honours hum Ser

John Thomas
