Dear Sir
Paris June <4> 5th. 1779



By advices from America since my last to you, my Enemies are determind to impeach my attachment to our Country and <our> her cause, per fas et per nefas.1 This makes it necessary for me to request [74]of you, your opinion on that point, from the knowlege you have had of my conduct while we acted together in Commission. The Calumnies of wicked men, can only be refuted by the testimony of those who are honest and competent, and it is necessary for me to desire this of you least any accident, which God forbid, shoud befal you on the voyage.2
Late Letters from Charles town say they are all in good spirits there.3 No other news.

I have the honor to be Dear Sir, with the greatest esteem yr. most Obedt. Humb. Servt
