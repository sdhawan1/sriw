We can give you no Directions about the Articles entreposed for the Coast of Guinea: because We understand nothing about the Matter. We neither understand, why, they were entreposednor what entreposing is.2
It is impossible for Us to apply to the Minister, without understanding the subject and knowing what Minister We are to apply to, and what Favour We are to apply for.
