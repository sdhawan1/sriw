I have not forgotten, gentlemen, the interest you took in Mr. Jones and your request that he be granted an armed vessel to carry him to America.1 The King, to whom I have rendered a report, is disposed to give the captain this facility. But I would like to know, beforehand, if it would be at all possible to make up the crew of the vessel, which will be provided Mr. Jones, from American sailors, since the activity and the number of His Majestys ships in commission would not allow him to provide a French crew. I will await your response on this subject before receiving the final orders of His Majesty.
I have the honor to be, &c.

De Sartine
