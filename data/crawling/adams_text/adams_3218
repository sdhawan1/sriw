Amsterdam 4th. Aprill 1781



The expection of the french Letters made it to late yesterday, so that or Letters reached to late even for the post, where for we mst begg Yor Excellencys pardon to have only forwarded the Same to day by the Way of Harlem, we receivd English Letters since, a great deal of good news seem to be in the papers both from the Continent and the East Indies. We think they make largely pp for the boasted of afair of St. Eustacia; we have gott lately letters miscarried going to the Hage, so we begg yor Excellency to excse or Caution not to extend on some particlars, which were Comnicated to s, they relate to illcidate some matters which alas we are to openly convinced of already; and by which means we may hope every thing will trn well at last and to or Wishes.
