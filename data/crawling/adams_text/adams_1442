We herewith communicate to your Excellency a Resolution of Congress relative to the Treaties, which we request may be laid before the King.1 Thereby his Majesty will perceive the unfeigned Sentiments of that Body, as well as those of the whole American People, whose Hearts the King has gained by his great Benevolence towards them, manifested in these Treaties, which has made so deep an Impression on their Minds, that no Time will efface it. We are, with great Respect, your Excellencys most obedient and most humble Servants
