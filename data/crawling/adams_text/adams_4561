Gentlemen,
Paris, May 10 1783.



It is some Months ago since I had the honor to write you, & am well persuaded, altho I received no Answer thereto, that it will have engaged your attention. I earnestly wish it may have been productive of an Improvement to the Finances of Congress which I then foresaw would be short of our Wants & which is unfortunately too much the case at present.
Last Month I remitted to the Honorable Rt. Morris the State of his Account, the Ballance of which were []413,892.13. 9. due to me.1 This added to the subsequent Payments I had to make would have thrown me in a State of Perplexity had it not been for the Assistance given me by the Garde du Tresor Royal.
You will see, Gentlemen, by the State I have the honour to inclose for your Consideration that the Sums I am to pay exceed of one Million those that are to be paid me. And making even Abstraction of all that is not M. Morris Bill there still remains a defect of []500,000 independant of the Allowance to be made for his usual Wants from Jany. 24 (date of his last Bills) up to the 12th. of March.
I am happy to have it in my Power to say that I have exerted to this instant all that my Zeal & my Faculties could suggest me, did the last keep Pace with the former, I should never have applied but to them. However the State of Affairs is such now, that a Resolution must be taken relative thereto, & even without delay. The Bearers of M. Morris Bills growing so urgent upon me that rather than to have occasioned an Eclat before I could be informed with your Resolution, I prefferred accepting a further Sum of []54000. this Day.
I crave your Excellencies will honour me with a quick answer,2 meantime, I remain, / most respectfully, / Gentlemen, / Your Most obedient / & most humble Servt.
