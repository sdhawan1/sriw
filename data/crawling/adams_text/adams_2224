Paris, 25 February 1780.
printed: JA, Diary and Autobiography, 4:253254.
Replying to Vergennes letter of the 24th (calendared above), John Adams expressed his appreciation for his upcoming presentation at the French court. He also agreed to avoid publicizing his peace commission before its announcement in the Gazette, to submit any announcement that he might seek to have published in the Dutch papers, and to keep secret his commission to negotiate an Anglo-American commercial treaty. This is the last complete letter included in JAs Autobiography.
