We have the Honour to be informed by His Excellency, M. de Sartine, that he has taken Measures concerning the Prisoners, and We have the Pleasure to inform you that We have, received from this Minister a Passport for a Cartel Ship to come from England to Nantes or Lorient, with American Prisoners, which ship we hope will take off, of your Hands and ours all the British Prisoners, now in France, which have been taken by American Vessells public or private. This Passport We transmitted to England, Yesterday. <We are with great Respect>, &c. We hope, at length that these unhappy People, both British and Americans, who have been so long in Captivity, will be restored in a very short time to their Liberty. If they are not, it shall not be our fault.
We wish the Balimore to sail as soon as possible, having no particular orders to give concerning her.
We take notice that you have charged five Per Cent for Commissions which we think too much, we are willing to allow you the Customary Commission, which we understand is two Per Cent.
