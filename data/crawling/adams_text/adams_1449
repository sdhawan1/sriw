Passy, 20 July 1778. printed: JA, Diary and Autobiography, 4:168170; also, with The Function of Consuls enclosed, in Wharton, ed., Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev., 2:650653. The Commissioners reported that the Spy had arrived with ratified copies of the Franco-American treaties and that the exchange of ratifications had occurred on the 17th. In regard to the deletion of Articles 11 and 12 of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, the Commissioners stated that, despite receiving news of the action and assurances from the French government that it was agreeable to the change, they were still awaiting instructions and authorization. The Commissioners also commented on the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and France at sea; the prospect of Spains joining France against England; their financial situation, requesting that the congress limit its drafts on them; and the services of C. W. F. Dumas, which they believed justified an annual payment of 200 sterling. Finally, the Commissioners noted that the resolution of the congress of 9 Feb. and a letter from the Committee of Commerce of the same date (JCC, 10:139; letter not found) concerning the appointment of commercial agents had been superseded by the Treaty of Amity and [307]Commerce, which permitted the appointment of consuls. They requested instructions on such appointments.
