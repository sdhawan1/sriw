Dear Sir
Lorient June 13. 1779



Since my Letter to you of the 9th. looking over the Answer to the Letter inclosed in it, I find it, of more importance than I was aware, and least it should be lost with me, I now inclose you a Copy of it.1 It will be Evidence, <of some> against some Misrepresentations, which have been made, and may be repeated, as injurious to the French Court as to you. I have the Honour to be, with great Esteem and Respect, sir, your humble servant.
