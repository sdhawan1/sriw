Dear Sir
Bruxelles Jan. 17th. 1781



I had the Honor of receiving your favor of the 1st. instant1 by Mr. Searle, who arrivd here two daies ago and intends to pursue his Journey tomorrow. You will receive by this post from our friend here2 a full account of the Amn. News such as we have it here by the two vessels arrivd at LOrient from Phila., and at Bourdx. from Maryland, tho you must have more authentic intelligence in your own Letters.
For your amusement I send you a copy of a printed hand bill that was stuck up at the corners of the Streets and other public places in Phila.3
It has been always my Idea that an open acknowlegement of the Independence of Ama. by the several powers of Europe woud greatly contribute to bringing about a Peace; on this principle I have strongly urged that their H. Mightinesses shoud commence an immediate Treaty with America and on our part, it appears to me that we shoud use all our address in forwarding the business; since otherwise, there may be War between, G.B. Hold. Russa. Swedn. and Denmark this year and a peace between them the next, leaving the War still to rage in Ama. We have no English Post, since the 2d. instant nor any later intelligence from thence.
The humours where you are, do not seem as yet to be sufficiently afloat, but we may suppose they will become somewhat warmer as the Spring Advances.
With the highest respect I have the Honor to remain Dear Sir Your most Obliged & Obedt. Servt.,

W. L.
