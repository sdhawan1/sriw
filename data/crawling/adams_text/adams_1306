My dear Sir

       [May 1778]1




In aid to your scrutiny after the real robber of the Commissioners Dispatches, I send what I think a good Confirmation of Folgiers honesty. By comparing the Governors2 letter with Folgiers Examination you will find the Governor led into a mistake about the number of Seals broken, by Folgiers forgetting that the outside Cover of the whole had anything more than Dispatches wrote on it. He told us differently 2 days after we had [172]sent an Express to Nth. Carolina. I am glad he did forget it at first as it strengthens eventually the nature of the Evidence.
You must not wonder that I make so much of this matter. It is of the highest Importance to you to be guarded against Bosom-Traitors yourself and to tear them from your Colleagues. I must add that no one here thinks Folgiers Employment by them a discreet Choice, tho he does not appear to be the Arch Traitor. Affectionately your Friend

James Lovell
