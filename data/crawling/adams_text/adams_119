7 June 1770. MS (M-Ar), in an unidentified hand. Printed: Mass., House Jour., 17701771, p. 22. Prepared by a committee appointed 6 June composed of Samuel Adams, JA, [242]John Hancock, James Warren, and Daniel Leonard, and reported to the House by Mr. Adams.
After the House adopted its resolutions of 6 June by which the members refused to conduct business outside Boston, JA was named to this committee charged with preparing an address to Hutchinson, praying that he would be pleased to remove the General Assembly to the Town House in Boston (Mass., House Jour., 17701771, p. 1622). The committees draft address, submitted 7 June, was approved by the House and delivered to Hutchinson by a committee of which JA was a member. The Address asserted that convening the General Court in Cambridge was a very great Grievance and concluded with a request that Hutchinson return the legislature to Boston because of the Houses claim that it is by no Means expedient to conduct business out of that town and as there are Matters now lying before the Assembly of very great Importance.
