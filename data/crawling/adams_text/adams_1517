Honorable Gentlemen
LOrient 17 Augst. 1778



The Brig Lady Washington Cap: Rowntree arrived here yesterday from James River Virginia loaded with Tobacco. She saild from thence the 8th. July. The Captain tells me the two armys [376]were then in the Jerseys, and that the Enemys ships were still in the Delaware, in order I suppose to insure its retreat if necessary, that General Washingtons army amounted to 18,000 men,1 the people in general in high spirits and the money increasing in its value. He gives no other account of Count DEsting, than that his fleet was daily expected, on which account the English Naval forces were united in Delaware. I have the honor to be respectfully Honble. Gentlemen Your assurd hle. st.,2
