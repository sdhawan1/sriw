Paris, 13 February 1780. printed: JA, Diary and Autobiography, 4:248.
This letter was a reply to Sartines of 31 Dec. 1779 (same, 4:247248), which Adams received when he arrived at Paris. In that letter the minister congratulated him on his new appointment and expressed his pleasure that he had been able to return to Europe on La Sensible. Adams thanked Sartine for his letter and indicated his gratitude for the aid given and the courtesies shown him by Grard, La Luzerne, and Capt. Chavagnes in allowing him to make his return voyage on the French frigate.
