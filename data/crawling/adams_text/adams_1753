Sir
Passy Novr. 12 1778



The Alliance between this Kingdom, and the United States of America, is an Event of such Magnitude in their History, that We conceive it would be highly pleasing to our Constituents, to have the Picture of <their> his Majesty their illustrious <Friend and> Ally, to be kept in some Public Place where the Congress sits.
We would carefully avoid every Thing which would be disagreable <to the King and Queen>, and would therefore submit this Proposal to your Excellencys Consideration: and if you should be of opinion that no offence would be given, We request, your Excellencys kind offices, to procure Us for the Benefit of our Constituents, the Pictures of their Majestys the King and Queen, that Posterity, as well as those of the present Generation who may never have an opportunity of seeing those Royal Personages, may become acquainted with the nearest Resemblances of them, which the Arts have devised.1
