Youll excuse our Liberty to trouble you with the present, but the assurance of your Patriotism & Uninterrupted Zeal for your Country, makes us flatter ourselfs that youll take such in the Light, that our Sincere Wishes and our only Views are to make both our Countries become in mutual Avantageous and the most Amicabel Connections, we are Convinced that it lays in your power to promote [289]such, and to procure us and our City all such Benefices or Emoluments, which are granted to other Powers, may we there fore Request from you these assistances, and that you will favor us with such Letters as Necessary to fullfill our most Earnest Wishes, in Particular that to Congress; that we may receive theyr Protection and enjoy all the Benefice which they grant to other Nations.
