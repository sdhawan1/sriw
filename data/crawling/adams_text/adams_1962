Sir
Bordeaux 6 March 1779



Mr. Vernon Junr. having obtained a knowledge of the French Language sufficient to introduce him into a Compting House he is returnd to Bordeaux. I have taken him to my Lodgings but my concerns not being sufficiently extensive and varied as to give him the knowledge it will be his Interest to acquire I propose engaging some House of distinguishd Character to take him into their Compting House but as I apprehend his Father has perticularly recommended him to your protection I shall wait your advice and instructions before I take any Step on this head.1
I observe by Letters last post from Doctr. Franklin some changes [5]have taken place in the European Establishment from Congress but am entirely uninformd of their Nature. It appears Mr. Deane has created a flame that will require time to quench and that <at a time> when other objects demands every publick attention and harmony.

I am respectfully Sir Your very hble. Servant
John Bondfield
