Dear Sir
Versailles, 1 [January]1 1779



I read to Count Vergennes that which concerns the Count dEstaing in the note with which you honored me. He recommended that I mention it in my journal. But it will have to appear in the number after that which will appear tomorrow. I have also included an English piecesigned Fire and Sword,2 which should amuse you.
I am, with respect, sir, your very humble and very obedient servant,

Genet


I am keeping an eye out for the piece from Virginia in the British papers.
