Honorable Gentlemen
LOrient 1st. August 1778



The Frigate Boston saild this morning with her three prizes. Captain Tucker happend accidentally to have mentiond to me, that he had your orders to take on board some goods here, but that as the wind was fair, he determind not to wait for them. If it is a disapointment to you, which in any manner can be remedied by loading them on a french bottom, I can give you freight for them on reasonable terms, by one that I shall dispatch in all the next month for America.
I am much obliged to Mr. Franklin for having advanced Mr. Ogden1 Eight Guineas, in that gentlemans way hither, which sum I desire my friend in Paris to pay him. I would have acknowledged that favor sooner, if Mr. Ogden had acquainted me therwith before. I have the honor to be respectfully Honorable Gentlemen Your assurd hi sv
