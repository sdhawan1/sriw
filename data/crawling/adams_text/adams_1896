Gentlemen
The Hague, 19 January 1779



My last was of the 1618 of this month. Contrary to our expectations and to our great surprise, nothing happened today at the Assembly of Holland. There were no deliberations, only the reading of the Ambassadors latest memorandum. Today I have had five meetings with the Ambassador, and as many with our friend (once at the edge of town where he was dining). To the Ambassador I wrote the following note: Tomorrow there will be work for the Admiralties of Holland. I have this from a very good source and surmise that this is the reason for todays inaction and will produce a new preliminary advisory. I will return this evening to Your Excellency knows where. On the 15th I had written him the following: One expects and is persuaded that His Excellency will disclose nothing concerning the secretthe four months delayconfided from yesterdays deliberations1 because, since the resolution [365]has not yet been adopted, he would be asked: Who told you so? Moreover, the reason for the delay in responding to the memorandum is sufficient to have no need to unburden oneself, &c. All the other details of my messages would be as tedious to read as to write. Amsterdams two pensionaries, having on the 16th rendered their town an account of the Ambassadors official visit, have received its response and tomorrow morning will present it officially to the Ambassador. He awaits only the final resolution of the States of Holland, which will be adopted the day after tomorrow, in order to send it by an express to his Court.
