Bordeaux 21 Nov 1778



I attended yesterday to the Vissit made by the Inspector of the Artillery of the Cannon laying at this Port belonging to Monsr. Le Bertin. The report is as favorable as can be given as to their appearance which is all that can be said of them until Proved. The following is the list given me in by the person who has them under his care.

There are in other Ports more belonging to the same concern on the same Mold. You will please to observe that the proving [of such?] heavy Artilery amounts to a considerable Sum. [Sh]ould you see fitting to order the proving be assured of my due attention as also to the quality of the Powder which being a perquisite of the Captain of the Port is made frequently with very little precaution.
Monsieur de La Touche has been so obliging as to order a frigate to take our Ships round from La Rochelle to Nantes where I expect they are arrived and loading the Various Articles there lodged which Mr. Schweighauser assured us would be prepared ready at their Arrival.
The latest Arrivals we have at this Port is from Alexandria of 20 Septembre of course we are without any intelegence other than is at your hands.
I have the Honor to be with due Respect, Sirs Your most Obedient Humble Servant

John Bondfield
