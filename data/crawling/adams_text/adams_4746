Sir
Auteuil Oct: 26th.. 1783


I now inclose you four Letters received since your departure1
Several very heavey failures have happend at Paris One of them is the House of Bost Horion & Co. for upwards of 3,000,000. Some others are talkd of. The Affairs of the Caisse DEscompte are now pretty well settled & the Managers talk of beginning to pay in Specie in the Month of Novemr:2
By the London papers I see that Barney arrived the 9th: of Septemr. There is a Letter of Sr. Guy Carletons of the 17th. Augt: which appears to me a kind of half refusal to quit New-York It is a whole one in some respects & the Generals disposition seems to me very ripe to refuse in toto.3
I expect Mr. Barclay in a few days Mrs. Ridley has been exceedingly ill; but I now begin to have Hopes The rest of the Family Bravely & all desire to be remembered to you & Son Be pleased to inform Mr Jay I was at Passy last Night & that all were well there, but Mrs. Jay a little impatient to hear of his safe Arrival.
With respect I have the Honor to be / Sir / Your most Obedient / humble Servant
Matt: Ridley
