The Committee appointed on Fryday last to receive Proposals &c Report verbally that they had received several Proposals and plans, which appeared to them very likely to promote the Ease of those Inhabitants who may be brought into Distress by the Operation of the detested Port-Bill but that not having had time to digest those Plans, they asked Leave to set again, and report at the Adjournment, when having heard from the other Colonies, they will be better able to make said Report.
