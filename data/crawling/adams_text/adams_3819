Sir
Zwolle, 6 April 1782



I have the satisfaction to communicate to Your Excellency that the States of Overijssel resolved yesterday, nemine contradicente,1 to recognize Your Excellency as minister of the United States of North America. Blessed be God.

I have the honor to be, with a profound respect for Your Excellency, your most humble and most obedient servant.
