Amsterdam, 17 October 1781. RC in John Thaxters hand (PCC, Misc. Papers, Reel No. 1, f. 423426). printed: Wharton, ed., Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev., 4:782783. Included in this letter, a duplicate, was an English translation of a placard issued at Utrecht on 3 Oct. against Aan het Volk van Nederland. According to JA, the pamphlet had occasioned a great Alarm to the Government, and a great Agitation of Spirits among the People. The placard described the pamphlet as a slanderous attack on the current stadholder and his predecessors, as well as an effort to overthrow the current government and replace it with a Democracy, or Regency of the People, and thus to cause the Republick to fall into an entire Anarchy. A reward of 1,400 guilders was offered for information leading to the prosecution and punishment of the author and distributor of the pamphlet. For the complete text of a similar placard issued by the States of Holland on 19 Oct., and additional comments on the pamphlet, see JA to the president of Congress, 25 Oct., below.
