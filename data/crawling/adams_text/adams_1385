Hond. Gentlemen
Dunkirk 30th. June 1778



I take the liberty to crave your referrence to the letter I had the honnor of writing to you the 22d. instant1 being Still deprived of your long wishd for favours, the Sole motif of this, is to inform you, that one John Gibson Master of an English Smuggling vessell which arrived here this morning, told me that Six Russian Ships of war vizt. three of 90, and three of 74 guns, are arrived in England, and that Six more of the Same force are dayly Expected, as they all Twelve Saild together from Crownstad [Kronstadt].2 The Captains and officers on board these Ships are English and Scotch, and the people Russians. Three of the former are orderd to Sheerness, and three to Portsmouth to be put into the docks, to be Surveyed. This Intelligence appeard to me too interesting to obmit communicating it to you, in the Same words as I received it. I have the honnor to remain very respectfully, Hond. Gentlemen, Your most obedient and most devoted Humble Servant

Frans. Coffyn
