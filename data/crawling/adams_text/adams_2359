Paris, 15 April 1780. RC in John Thaxters hand (PCC, No. 84, I, f. 455461). printed: Wharton, ed., Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev., 3:615618.
In this letter, received by Congress on 19 Feb. 1781, John Adams included newspaper accounts from Hamburg, Leghorn, Madrid, Paris, and London on a variety of subjects, including the League of Armed Neutrality, Russias formal declaration of armed neutrality in major European capitals, preparations for a military expedition from Cdiz, and Adams own arrival in Europe to negotiate peace with Great Britain. The bulk of the letter, however, was devoted to a London newspaper article advancing a Plan of Pacification, said to be sponsored by the Rockingham Whigs and aimed at ending the American war, and another London article opposing Rockingham.
