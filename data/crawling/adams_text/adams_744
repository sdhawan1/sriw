22 August. On this date the Board presented a report that was tabled, with no indication given of its content (JCC, 5:696). This was probably the report on the petition of Preudhome La Jeunesse that had been referred to the Board of War on 21 Aug. (same, p. 692). This report, dated by the Board 21 Aug. but not recorded under that date in the JCC, is extant and in the hand of Richard Peters. Bearing the notation Agreed to report to Congress and docketed Orderd to Lie, the report recommended that La Jeunesse be given a commission as captain and attached to Col. James Livingstons regiment at Ticonderoga (PCC, No. 147, I).
