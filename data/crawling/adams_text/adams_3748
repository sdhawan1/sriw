I am just arrivd here from London, and instead of personally waiting upon You I make so free as to send a messenger with this and its inclosure together with a few late News Papers.

I am at present, and shall be for tomorrow, totally unknown in the Hotel, a line[340] directed for me, or any message to the Gentn who arrivd this night and lodges in the Room No 10 will be duly attended to.
