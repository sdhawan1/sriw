Sir
Paris. 14th. Decemr: 17821



There is more matter than time to write at present. The King of Sweden has done the United-States great honor, in his Commission [126]to his Minister here to treat with them, by inserting, that he had a great desire to form a Connexion with States, which had so fully established their Independence, and, by the wise & gallant Conduct, so well deserved it; and his Minister desired it might be remembered, that his Sovreign was the first who had voluntarily proposed a Treaty with us2
Mr: Secretary Townsend announced, on the 3d. of December, in a letter to the Ld. Mayor, the Signature of our Preliminaries.3 On the 5th. his Majesty announced it, in his Speech to both Houses Addresses of Thanks, in both houses, passed without a division.4
There is a note in the Courier de lEurope, of the 6th. inst. worth transcribingvizt. Nous distinguons ces trois Lignes avec des Caracteres italiques, a fin de prendre date daujourdhui de lassertion sur laquelle nous nous tendrons davantage par la suite; que ce nest a aucune des Causes indigues jusqua present mme dans les deux Chambres du Parlement que nous devons la Paix, les Benedictions de cette Paix que nous regardons come certaine mais a la Neutralit arme. Elle sera durable cette Paix5
I have transcribed this note, because it falls in with an opinion that I have long entertained. The armed-Neutrality, & even Mr: Danas Mission to it, has had greater Effects than the world is yet informed ofand would have had much greater, if his hands had not been tied
On the 4th. inst: I wrote a resignation of all my Employments in Europe, which I have now the honor to confirm, & to request that the acceptance of it may be transmitted to me several ways, by the first Ships
I have the honor to be, Sir, / Yr: Most Obedt: / humle: servt
John Adams
