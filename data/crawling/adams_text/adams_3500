I have received the packet your Excellency has honored me with from Leyden on the 11. instant of last march.2 I have forwarded his Letters according to their direction and I give him thousand thanks. I have Seen Mrs. Adams at Brentree and I Send you, Sir, a packet that She has caused to forward me yesterday.3 I herein inclose a very interressing pamphlet wich causes a Lively and gnral joy.4 I wish for the exchange of that glorious News, you would acquaint me soon with that of gneral Peace.

I have the honour to be, with greatest Respect, of your Excellency, the most-humble and most-obedient
Servant de Ltombe


P.S. I wrote just now to Mrs. Adams to assure her mind about the incredible Report respecting the Indian man Mr. Guilon Commander.5
