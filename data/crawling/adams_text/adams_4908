Honord Sir
Amsterdam April the 16. 1784



on the 26 last, I have sent your Excell: pr the Marketboat, the Two Medals you desired, according to a letter rec: from the Gentleman your Son of the 23d: past and at the same time I sent a Box with five small Medals (to be used for counters at the game of Whist) Invented b me and made at the desire of a Compan of good Friends.1 desire you to accept the same not so much for the Value as for the speculation and to se if the Defenition of the game is to be found therein.
This letter ought to have gone with the Said Packet if I had not flatterd mself to rec: an answer from Mr. John Stockdale of London, at least to m letter of the 5th: March. I have received no letters at all from that Man not even to Inform me that he rec: m Packet which I sent him the 5th: December of last year nor answer to an other letters sent him b the post, which makes me a little uneas, although your Excellency advised me to it b your Letter from London dated  and under his cover besides the medals which I sent him in commission to sell 4 Medals to your Excellency which I inclosed according to your order, and also one on the Baron van de Capellen tot de Pol,2 besides the 2 medals per Post also under his Cover sent to your Excellenc, and which you have received. Be pleased to have the goodness Sir, b some means or other to let that man know that he must write to me and answer m letters, for your Excellenc knows that it was on your recommendation I sent him the medals if he cant or wont sell them in Commission, let him return them to me, I did not mean to offend him3
I Flatter mself that your Excellenc is convinced of m good Intention, and will be so kind as to take the trouble in this affair to get it settled for it is to trifling to let it linger a long while
[167]
I have the Honord to subscribe mself with Veneration and Respect / Your Exllencys / Most Ob Humb servant

Jean George Holtzhey.
