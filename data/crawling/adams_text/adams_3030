Amsterdam the 22d. January 1781



May it please Yor Excellency that we now lay before her the papers she hath charged us with to prepare for a Loan, we shall have the honor to undertake for and in behalf of the United States of North America; we have discused the Same on the Advice of Some people accstomed to regulate money matters, on which they have been corrected by a Lawer, we should be verry happy if yor Excellency would be so Kind as to honor s with her remarks, there on, for they Should not be only Satisfactory on one Side. And when we come further to consult other Lenders there may be some few remarcks to be made on expressions or otherwise, being we think and are in hopes this may do very weal.1
The last periode of the Ratification and aprobation of Congress of [73]this loan is taken from the Contents of Yor Excellencys power;2 there is another piece it seems reqired to be filled p in the blanck Space, where it is mentioned this should be also Annexed to the Original Obligation, here it means a single attest of Yor Excellencys powers by Some publicq Minister which would at all events be very easy to be procred.
Further we flatter or Selfs that Yor Excellency will be intirely Satisfied with the publicq terms containd in this plan, and as to the private, for Comissions allowances &ca. as Yor Excy. hinted to s her terms would be generos, we have no dobt to agree with them, as we never were nreasonable, and always devoted to do every thing which could be agreable to yor Excellency and to Congress.
We mst begg leave for some Deficiency in the English of this plan, it is a translation from the Dutch, and where forms and laws are not the Same, the verball translations mst sound Strange in any other Language; this however we thought to be reqired in a transaction of this natre which is to serve for the Dutch.
With the most perfect Regard and Esteem we have the honor to be Honord Sir, Yor Excellencys most devoted & most obedient hmble Servant

John de Neufville & Son
