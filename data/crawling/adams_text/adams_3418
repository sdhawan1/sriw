Sir
Philada. July 21st. 1781



I do not find by President Huntingtons Letter Book that he has forwarded the within Resolve of July 12th. respecting your Powers of Sept. 29th. 1779 therefore I take the Opportunity of two Vessels which are to sail in a few Hours, to communicate it doubly.

Your humble Servant

James Lovellfor the Comte. of for. Affrs.

The whole of the Proceedings here in regard to your two Commissions, are I think, Ill judged but I persuade myself no dishonour was for you intended, the Business greatly in every view chagrins me. This you will have learnt from my former Letters written in an half light.1
By her own Account your Lady was well June 30th.2 Your last to us is of Oct. 24.3
