Amsterdam, 23 May 1781. RC in John Thaxters handPCC, No. 84, III, f. 159. printed: JA, Corr. in the Boston Patriot, p. 465.
This letter requested Congress to offer relief to the owners of an unnamed Dutch vessel captured by a British warship or privateer, recaptured by an American privateer, and then sold. This letter may refer to the Dutch brig Union, about which John Adams had written to William Greene, governor of Rhode Island, on 9 May (LbC, Adams Papers). There Adams requested Greenes assistance for Johannes de Lover & Sons of Amsterdam, the owners of a vessel captured by [328] the Revenge, a British privateer commanded by a Capt. Kentith, then recaptured and taken into Providence. Unfortunately the papers enclosed with Adams letter to Congress have not been found, and there is no additional extant correspondence between Adams, Congress, and Greene on the matter.
