Sir

We have the honor to acknowledge the Receit of yor Excellencys most esteemed favor of 27th. May. wherein we Observe what yor Excelly. is pleased to Say about the Definitive Treaty. but as by all dispensed Accounts we have no great Reason to think of its being Soon Concluded, it may make yor Excellys. Stay at Paris much Longer than yor Excelly. self can fooreseen; wherefore Should it Succeed us (so as we hope). in distributing a Large quantity of Obligations in the Months of July and August, it Certainly would put s into Some Inconveniency.1 This has determined us to take the Liberty to Send yor Excellency by way of the Widow Smits of Anvers a Small Case Containing Two Thousand and Three Obligations (which three only Serve in Case any misfortne in [43]Signing of em happen).2 Claim[ing] on them yor Excellencys Signature, as Likewise the Return of em, as Soon as yor Excellencys Occupations will permit it.
We have the honor to Remain Very Respectflly / Sir / Yor Excellencys most / Obedt. humb. Servants.
