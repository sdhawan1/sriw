LbC with postscript in Thaxters hand (Adams Papers); [501]notation by Thaxter: Nos. 89 & 90 delivered to Mr. Gridley going to Amsterdam. July 8th. 1780. printed: Wharton, ed., Dipl. Corr. Amer.

This letter, received by Congress on 19 Feb. 1781, consists largely of an English translation of the French text of the bill that David Hartley sought unsuccessfully to introduce in the House of Commons on 27 June (see Thomas Digges to JA, 29 June, and note 3, above; David Hartley to JA, 17 July, below; the Descriptive List of Illustrations, vol. 10). John Adams made his translation from the Courier de lEurope of 30 June because he could not obtain his usual London newspapers. Adams also included the Couriers account of the parliamentary proceedings relating to the bill and its criticism of Hartley for seeking to empower George III to make peace, a power he already had by virtue of being King. Only Parliaments refusal of funds to carry on the war could force him to seek peace. Adams noted that there could be no hope for peace until efforts to seek a reconciliation short of independence were abandoned. He predicted that events in America and the West Indies would soon dampen the elation caused by the capture of Charleston. Finally, Adams noted Sir George Savilles unsuccessful motion to condemn the war in America, made immediately after the defeat of Hartleys motion.
