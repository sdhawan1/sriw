Gentlemen
The Hague March 24: 1784.



I have received your favour of the 19: and congratulate you on the Success of the Loan. It gives me great Pleasure to find that American Credit is not quite exhausted, and I flatter myself that every
[96]
Day will contribute something, towards removing the Prejudices, and Jealousies, and towards confuting the Calumnies, which have hitherto obstructed you and me, in our Endeavours to serve the United States in this way
The Coupons, paid by Mr: De Neufville, must in Justice be paid by you in Behalf of the United States; But I wish you to examine the account which you paid to Mr: De Neufville, heretofore, and see if these Coupons are not contained in that, and already paid, as I supposed they were. / I am &c.
