Gentlemen
The Hague, 13 September 1778



Although today is not post-day, I will begin by informing you that, after a long session yesterday, the Assembly of Holland has finally resolved that as long as France and Britain are at war and in addition to the squadron in the West Indies, it would increase the Republics forces by 32 ships of the line and frigates, and 8,000 crewmen, to serve in Europe, mainly in the Channel and the North Sea. Of these 32 vessels, part will be ready by next January and the rest during the course of the next year.1
The address by the Bourse of Amsterdam has arrived and will be the topic of the next deliberations.2 The Assembly will thus be in session a few more days.
They told the Grand Pensionary that they would expect some vigorous dmarches by both the government and an important personage, not only on the demands to be made, but also on the most effective means of compelling the English to allow the Republic to observe the most exact neutrality and on the orders to be given to captains of warships in this regard. In response to the Grand Pensionarys evasions on this head, they told him very frankly that the party that would frustrate this legitimate expectation would be declaring itself manifestly in favor of England and would be an English Party, ready to sacrifice the Dutch to the British. I heard all this from good sources.
