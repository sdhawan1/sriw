Sir
Nantes Novr 17. 1778



By the Tenor of your Favour of the 8th Instant I apprehend I have committed an Indiscretion. The Satisfaction I feel in contributing to your Pleasure was my only motive and I beg that may be considered as my excuse.
The Rum cost me nothing, I cannot therefore fix a price, but Billy Franklin is my Banker in small affairs and you may settle it with him as you think proper.
I am with great Respect, Sir Your most obedient and most humble Servant

Jona Williams
