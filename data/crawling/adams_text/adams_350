Dear Sir
Philadelphia, July 24th, 1775



In Confidence,I am determined to write freely to you this Time.1 A certain great Fortune and piddling Genius2 whose Fame has been trumpeted so loudly, has given a silly Cast to our whole Doings We are between Hawk and BuzzardWe ought to have had in our Hands a Month ago, the whole Legislative, Executive and Judicial of the whole Continent, and have compleatly moddelled a Constitution, to have raised a Naval Power and opened all our Ports wide, to have arrested every Friend to Government on the Continent and held them as Hostages for the poor Victims in Boston. And then opened the Door as wide as possible for Peace and Reconcilliation: After this they might have petitioned and negotiated and addressed, &c. if they would.Is all this extravagant?Is it wild?Is it not the soundest Policy?
One Piece of NewsSeven Thousand Weight of Powder arrived here last NightWe shall send along some as soon as we canBut you must be patient and frugal.
We are lost in the extensiveness of our Field of BusinessWe have a Continental Treasury to establish, a Paymaster to choose, and a Committee of Correspondence, or Safety, or Accounts, or something, I know not what that has confounded us all Day.
Shall I hail you Speaker of the House, Counsellor or whatWhat Kind of an Election had you? What Sort of Magistrates do you intend to make?
Will your new Legislative and Executive feel bold, or irresolute? Will your Judicial hang and whip, and fine and imprison, without Scruples?3 I want to see our distressed4 Country once moreyet I dread the Sight of Devastation.
You observe in your Letter the Oddity of a great Man5He is a queer CreatureBut you must love his Dogs if you love him, and forgive a Thousand Whims for the Sake of the Soldier and the Scholar.6
Addressed, To the Hon. James Warren, Watertown. Favord by Mr. Hitchborne.
