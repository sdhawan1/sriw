Dear Sir
Amsterdam Septr. 2. 1780



Yours of 27 Ultimo came to hand last night. Mr. Bradford informs me that he Sent to Paris by Post a Packet from Dr. Cooper to me.1 Have you heard nothing of it?
Upon my first Arrival I told Mr. De Neufville, that I had orders to pay him 60 st. for you and offered to do it then; but he has put it off.
There are no Vessells here going to Massachusettsbut there is one going to Rhode Island, and one to Virginia. There is one also in which Mr. Cabot is interested. I thank you for accepting Mr. Gardoquis Bill. The News of the Captures made off St. Vincents by the combined Fleets has not yet gained full Credit here. There is neither Letter nor Newspaper from London later than the 18 of August.
