Honourd Sir
Amsterdam the 13th. March 1781



With infinite pleasre we always obey Yor Excellencys commands, and are preparing fifty bonds provisionally with their coupons, to be send tomorrow. As soon as it may be required we will take care to have a greater quantity ready. We will join these to a sufficient provisionall quantity of blancs of the Coupons, which Yor Excellency promisd to retrn s with the bonds when Signd.
May we thank yor Excellency most sincerely for her observations that the Loan hath not been opend to soon, this Releases or neasiness of not succeeding in it as yett as we had wished; a proper time Certainly will Come on in Coarse and we wish it to be very soon, as much as it may lay in or power we will advance it.
There can remain hardly any dobt butt the acknowledgement of American Independence and of a generall free Trade is the object of the Mediation of Rssia, and we for or Selfs have reason to rejoice in it, we cold only wish that or Republicq had acted a greater part there in; as she was once able to resist her Enemy before alone, and now seems to creep before that same Nation, though she may depend on the Assistance of all the Other Powers.
How this Mediation turns, it certainly can do no harm to the American Case, and there fore can not affect the Loan, we hope we shall not be deceived, and will take the more Care of it by yor [199]Excellencys repeated Cations, we think we go on very well, and as we have always and will act to or conscience, we can not be wrong; May yor Excellency Succeed to or wishes at every experiment she might chse to try! We expect some intelligence next Week, which she will be acquainted with if answering or expectations.
With all Respectfull regard we have the honor to be Honourable Sir, Yor Excellencys most devoted and most obedient humble servants
