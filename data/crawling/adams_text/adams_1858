Sirs
Bordeaux 1 Jany 1779



I have the Honor to pay my most respectful Compliments of Season wishing prosperity to all your undertakings.
We are without any Arrivals since I had the Honor to write you the 5th Ultimo. By Letters from Nantes I am informd the Chasseur is [329]Loaded and all is ready for the other Ship which contrary winds have detaind near two Months at Isl of Rh not more than 24 hours sail from Nantes.1 I rejoice to learn a Convoy is appointed as we may thereby promise ourselves more protection than merchant Ships could otherways give to each other. The continued advices of Captures has Stagnated all private expeditions. Premiums out or home are at 60 P Cent which absorbs the Capital. I have the Honor to be respectfully Sirs Your very hhb Servant
