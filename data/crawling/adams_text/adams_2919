This letter, received by Congress on 19 Nov. 1781, contained the order of battle of the combined French and Spanish fleets at Cdiz. The information, probably taken from the Gazette de Leyde of 1 Dec., was copied into the Letterbook by JQA immediately below JAs brief opening paragraph. It is the first known instance where JQA, acting as his fathers secretary, copies a letter to Congress.
