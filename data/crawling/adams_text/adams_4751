When Mr Oldfield asked me to give him leave to make use of my name when he waited on your Excellency, with a card of invitation to the Revolution Club for Tuesday Next, I did not then know that it was intended not to invite the Whigs at present in Administration, which I think necessary you Sir should be informed of.1
I have the honour to be with great respect / Yr: Excellencys / most obedt: Servant
Edward Bridgen
I beg my respectful Compliments to your Son
