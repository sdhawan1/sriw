Paris, 1 June 1780. RC (PCC, No. 84, II, f. 8688). LbC in John Thaxters hand (Adams Papers); notation by Thaxter: NB. Nos. 74 & 75 were delivered Como. J. P. Jones on the first of June 1780. printed: Wharton, ed., Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev., 3:750751.
In this letter, probably received by Congress on 5 Sept. (JCC, 17:803), John Adams, using British newspapers of 26 and 27 May as his source (to Genet, 1 June, note 1, above), summarized Rodneys published letter of 26 April, describing the Battle of Martinique on 17 April. Adams included the British line of battle and the casualties suffered by the fleet, but discounted Rodneys victory claim, seeing it instead as another drawn Battle that did little to support British claims of naval supremacy. Adams also noted the defeat of Thomas Pownalls motion on 24 May to introduce a bill to end the American war (Parliamentary Hist., 21:627628; to Unknown, 9 June, below); the dispatch of a British warship from Lisbon to warn Rodney of the sailing of a large fleet from Cdiz; and the imminent departure of the Hudson Bay fleet.
