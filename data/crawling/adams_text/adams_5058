Honourable Sir.
Leden the 27 October 1784.



We take the liberty to inclose a letter for Mr. Cranch: Which we beg Your Excellenc ma read and then forward to him the Sooner the better; We are afraid that or Connexion with this Gentleman or with Mr. Astin, will be of no Consequence & that it will come to Nothing in  Short time; the reason is that we ver seldom receive  letter from them & n information whether it be time or not to Send off an goods. & What Colors &ct: are Wanted: the distance of the two Contries makes it necessar to correspond frequentl & reglar; and we have done on or Side all what we cold do b providing Mr: Cranch or Mr Astin with  plent of goods to the
[353]
amount of  15,000: : dutch Currenc for this Sum we received bills of Exchange to the amount of  10,000: : dutch Currenc;  Part of the Goods remaining nsold; the amount of the bills is much more than we Know Mr. Cranch can have in cash; at least we did not receive an bills of Sale; We beg Yor Excellenc Kind assistance to encourage these Gentlemen to write s often; regular & Circmstantial; and if this be done we think to be able to make or Connexion of Conseqence & worth of attending: for We are very nwilling to loose the best & Surest opportunity, which we ever cold wish & which we grateful acknowledge to owe to your Excellencs Kindness, to have  Share in the Americain trade.
We inclose the Samples of Some Yds: of Cloth which we prepared pon or Order. & we wish to Know Whether & where well Send them or Keep them till we receive farther orders.
We are with ver much respect. / Honourable Sir: / Your Most Obedient & Humble. / Servants.

P:S: We beg Pardon that the Cloth of which we inclose the Samples was not Sent off before or depart from the Hage. but it was not read by that time.
J:v: Heukelom the Father having done in the Month of Augst  tor to Paris, called at yor Exellencs house at ateuil but was So unhapp not to find Your Excellenc at Home.1
