Sir,
Paris June 5th. 1783.


I have recd. your favor of 30. ulto. I am very apprehensive that the Gentleman you conversed with concerning the Loan is decieved, as his worthy Brother was on a former occasion, by whose Advice chiefly I was led to open the Loan with those three Houses.1 He was then of opinion, that even ten Millions might be obtained; whereas the three Houses have not been able to obtain in a year, so much Money as Mr. Hodshon would have obtained in a Month, if not in the first day.2
I hope that the first Ships will bring my Letter of Recall from that Republick, & another Minister to take my place with power to borrow Money. In that Case, the new Minister will be at liberty to open a new Loan if he thinks it prudent. I have a great Esteem for the Messieurs Willinks, & have no Objection to your conversing with them upon the Subject. I wish you would with all Secrecy.
I waited last Evening on Mr. Laurens with your Postscript, [17]respecting the Purchase of Lands in South Carolina Mr. Laurens will give me his Sentiments of it.3
My Regards to your Family & to your Ward. / yours respectfully.
