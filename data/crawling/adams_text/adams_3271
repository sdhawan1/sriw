Honourd Sir
Amsterdam the 3d. May 1781



May I begg leave to inform yor Excellency of the invitation I have gott on a sdden to vizit Paris for a few days, where I had the honor to wait on His Excellency B Franklin, who did me the honor to receive and treat me with the utmost politeness. I have mentioned again the Bill which yor Excellency had projected that we should Accept, as belonging to the former parcell btt Mr. Franklin said that he would write to yor Excellency on that matter, to Accept likewise this bill; so we dobt not btt this will be settled.1
I had also the honor to wait on Colonell Larens. He was so obliging as to allow me the money we advanced to Comodor Gillon and also the remainder of what the Comodor was in want for the Colonell should write to yor Excellency abot it2 and we doubt not btt on the Comodores proper application he will be assisted, as well as we, We never could have expected a more gracios relieve for [303]which we certainly acknowledge Yor Excellencys favors as we know she had been concernd in the matter, and if I had not determind in the moment I sett ot I would not have failed to ask for Yor Excellencys comands. My readiness to be employd in this bssiness for the Comodor brought me a reward not indifferent to my principles to see myself employd in a Comission for some supplys for Congress, Colonel Larens favourd my hose there with, and having already prepared a great part there off, I mst sett ot again to procre the remainder, leaving my son at the head of the hose; I do not expect I shall be long detaind before I am able to retrn, and then I shall not faill to pay my personall respects to Yor Excellency at the American Hotel in Amsterdam; with my best Wishes and exertions for all what can be noble and [respirat?] liberty I have the honor to be with perfect Regard and Esteem, Honord Sir Yor Excellencys most obedient and most humble Servant
