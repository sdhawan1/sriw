Sir
Leyden, 27 September 1780



Our sincere thanks for your kindness in sending us several interesting documents. I have the honor to send you back a few, and of asking your permission to keep the rest for a few more days, because I did not have enough time to copy them all at once, and I intend to use them as space will permit. The two Philadelphia letters have already been copied, but I was unable to publish their extracts.1 I hope that you will approve of the [184]use I have made of these various pieces and that the information they contain will help rid Europe of a few of its misconceptions as to the state of things.
I had a copy made of the pamphlet you gave me for the press, and I am expecting that it will go to print next week.
I have the honor to be, with utmost respect, sir, your excellencys very humble and very obedient servant,

J: Luzac
