those whom I Have Early joined in our Noble and Successfull Cause. I may add, that Opinions of Honest men, When they Have some influence, do more or less prove Serviceable and How Could I refrain from Visiting a Nation whose I am an Adoptive Son, and where, particularly Among Your fellow Citizens, I Have Experienced so Many Marks of Affection and Confidence
With Much Respect, and also with a Sincere Attachment I Have the Honour to Be / Dear Sir / Your obedient Humble / Servant
