Sir

We have received your Excellencys esteemed favour of 1 febr, by whch. we See you are pleased to consent of an extraordinary Sacrifice, whch. we pleaded by the undertakers, but could by no means prevail on them, and enfin declined it finally: thise displeasing
[5]
circumstances brought us in the necessity to take their opinion on a New Loan against 6 Per C: intrest, as your Excellency judged perfectly right, that it was much more preferable to do it, than to get the bills protested, we in consequence have proposed to them the inclosed Sheme, on whch. Sunday or monday next they jointly have promised the answer; that in case we can offer to them a reasonable premium & gratification some of them seemed inclined to hearken to it and we stipulated the ready payment of so many hunderd thousand Guilders this month that the bills falling due at the end to such amount will all be payed, we want therefore to pray Your Excellency to authorise us to Conclude it on this footing with 6 Per Ct. allowance for all the premiums brokeridges, gratifications Notary Seals obligations commn. &c & every expence besides. in case we can be happy enough to bring it to consistance, when we Shall directly draw up the Obligation to Sign for your Excellency and direct further matter in the most regular Way and order, desiring your answer here on for our government.1
We remain With great esteem / Sir / Your Excellencys most / Humbl & Obedient Servants
