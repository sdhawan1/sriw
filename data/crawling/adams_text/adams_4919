Sir
London 27th Aprl 1784



To the care of Doctr Parker who I am told will be a safe conveyance, & who has promised to deliver em himself, I inclose you two Letters from Americaone of which particularly from Mr S Adams I was desired to keep till I could see you or trust it only in safe handsthe other is from Mr Dalton1
I heard upon my first arrival in Ireland which was in Feby that you were in England, & hoped to have had the honour & pleasure of seeing you here it would have been a great satisfaction to me, & a great advantage in my mercantile affairs to have learnt from you what were likely to be the Determinations of this Court respecting commercial Arrangements with America perhaps you would answer me that they have no determinations at all I am rather inclined to think so from the little I have learned of their Politics since my Arrival
My Friend Mr Stephen Higginson desired me to enquire of you whether anything & what had been done with respect to their Claims for Losses at St. Eustatius by Rodneys Misconduct2 a line directed for me to the care of Messrs Rogers & Bromfield here would oblige me3
I hope every day to hear of a Commission from Congress in which you may be appointed with full powers to finish a commercial Treaty with this Court I may then hope for the pleasure of seeing you before I leave Englandwhich I dont much expect to till July
Our Politics at home must be miserably confounded if they suffer any Faction or Party longer to prevail to the Exclusion of deriving all advantages with the other Powers of Europe which our present Circumstances & Situation may afford, because Fe may wish to keep us all to herself
I take the liberty to inclose you several Letters giving Mr Higginsons & my name as connected in Business at Boston4 your distributing em among any of your valuable commercial Acquaintance
[178]
may do us a singular Service, & I hope will apologize for the freedom taken
I have the honour to be Dear Sir with great / respect & esteem / your faithfull Friend / & very obedient Servant

Jona. Jackson
