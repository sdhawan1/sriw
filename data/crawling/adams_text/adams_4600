Sir,
Paris June 10th. 1783.


Upon an Intimation from my Friend Dr. Tufts of Weymouth, that the Medical Society, of which you are President, desired to extend its Connections in Europe, I ventured to apply to the Chiefs of the Royale Socit de Mdecine at Paris, and met with a more complaisant Reception than I expected.
[25]
Enclosed are Copies of Letters which have passed upon the Occasion, and of the Diploma, which is the Result of them.1 The Originals I shall bring with me, or send by a careful Hand.
I hope the Medical Society will pardon my Presumption in going so far without their Authority But the Proposition once hinted at was recieved with so much Earnestness, that I could not recede.
With great Respect, I have the honor to be, / Sir, / your most obedient & / most humble Servant.
John Adams.2
