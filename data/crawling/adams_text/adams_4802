Sir
Passy, Jan. 3. 1784.1


I received the Letter you did me the Honour of writing to me by Capt. Jones, and immediately answerd it, acquainting you that my Packets containd no Commission, nor any Mention of one.2 I have just receivd another Letter from you, dated the 14th past, with a Number of Dispatches, but they are Duplicates only and as old as July; they contain nothing of the Commission neither, except the Vote that directs the making it out, which is dated in May. It seems to be forgotten. It was by no means possible for me to save Mr Morriss Bills. I was in hopes that if you had gone to Amsterdam you might have done something towards it. With great Respect, I have the Honour to be, / Sir, / Your Excellencys most obedt / & most humble Servant
B Franklin
