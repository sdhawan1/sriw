Sir
Passy, 25 February 1779



In regard to your desire, expressed to me yesterday, of returning to America and the dangers of being captured and made prisoner by your enemies, I have been thinking that your continuance at Passy might not suit you, and that you might prefer to live inexpensively in the country. I have in the Blesois1 a property that I do not occupy and I offer, with pleasure, to leave you the master of it as long as the war lasts.2 You will find there all the necessities of life even cheaper than here. I ask you, sir, to regard my offer as a testimony that I render to your virtues.
I have the honor to be very perfectly, sir, your very humble and very obedient servant

Leray de Chaumont
