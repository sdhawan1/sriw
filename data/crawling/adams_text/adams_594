My dear Sir
Watertown, Febry 19th. 1776



Your Family were pretty well yesterday; also Mr. Cranches and mine; N Q1 has a bad cold. I have been sick a few days, but am now better, so as to be abroad again.
Yesterday a Gentleman arrived here, said to be a Prussian Knight, from France to the W Indies, thence bound to Philadelphia, but brot on upon the back of the Cape, from thence hither, and now at head Quarters, has many Letters for Dr. Franklin, a Packet for the President of the Congress, and another for the Secretary of ditto.2 Tis Supposed that the Vessel was bound into Boston, tho he took passage for Philadelphia. Tis likely you will know more about it before you receive this. The Enemy threaten us hard at Braintree; but I hope to rouse the Sleeping Bear: Our Companies there3 have done hard duty, and are Somwhat discouraged by not having been commissionated; but I expect to obtain Commissions for em this Week, and to get a Major appointed over the 4 Companies: S Spear4 is moving off the Women and Children, and I expect others will move; but if the enemy dont attack us there, within 2 or 3 days, we Shall Stop the panic, [37]which is not great. I have Stolen a few hours from the Night, one time and another, to draw some imperfect Plans of Forts, and have presented them to the Court, in order to lead them to think seriously of making proper defences for Magazines, Harbours &c.
I heartily thank you for your present of common Sense; it is very welcom, and I believe no person was ever more eagerly read, nor more generally approved: People Speak of it in rapturous praise. Union among ourselves, and independency respecting Europe, seems to be the ardent wish of almost all. One of the Halls is dead, and the other dangerous, otherways it would have been re-printed: I intend to Speak to Edes about it tomorrow; it woud admit of a large impression.5
