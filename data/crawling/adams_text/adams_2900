Sir
Amsterdam Novr. 24th. 1780



The Letter which your Excellency did me the Honour to write me on the thirteenth is recieved, and I have accordingly accepted the Bills,1 and shall draw upon your Excellency about the Time they become payable, for Money, to enable me to discharge them, provided I should not succeed in my Endeavours to borrow it here.
I have hitherto no prospect at all. When I first arrived here, I had such Informations as made me believe that a Sum of Money might be had, upon the Credit of the United States: but the News from Carolina, and New York and the West Indies, but above all the Affair of the Burgomaster and Sir Joseph Yorkes Memorial have struck a Panic which must have Time to wear off. At present I meet with only one Gentleman,2 who thinks any thing can be done, and I fear that he decieves himself.
I hope by this Time, your Excellencys Health is restored, and have the Honour to be, Sir, Your Excellencys most obedient humble Servant

John Adams
