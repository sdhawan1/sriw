That we acknowledge the receipt of her most esteemd favor,1 the sentiments expressd there in are most liberall, we are in hopes they may prevaill with or people, btt nationally considered, we confess, we are mostly to slow in or motions, the generall, feel the English injury, they are sensible of its sorce, btt seem to mch abashd by the loss, to move as yett; may they be awakend in time! to prevent destrction and preserve liberty with smaller fortnes.
May we also thank Yor Excellency for the aproving of or arrange-[227]ment abot the Obligations, we are still in great hopes the loan will succeed btt not so soon as we wished, the Statia affair mst decide we think great things, and may accelerate American Independence, and the rights of Netrall Vessells.
