Sir
Passi Septemr. 9. 1778



We received yours1 in which you hint that it is wished by some of our Friends that the Commissioners would propose a Treaty to your Government. It would really be a great Pleasure to them to be instrumental in cementing a Union between the two Republics of Holland and the United States, by a Treaty of Amity and Commerce, similar to that lately concluded with France, or varying where Circumstances might require it. But having received no Answer from the Grand Pensionary, to a Letter2 they respectfully wrote his Excellency some Months since, expressing their Dispositions to such a good Work, they apprehend that any further Motion of the Kind, on their part, would not at present be agreeable, tho they still hold themselves ready to enter upon such a Treaty whenever it shall seem good to their High Mightinesses. We are with Esteem Your very humble Servants
