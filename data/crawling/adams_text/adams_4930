Sir
London May 7th. 1784.



I have the Honour of having received your Excellencys Letter, wherein I find a most Obliging Introduction to Mrs Adams, which I shall certainly make Use of, should I Ever have an Opportunity.1
I return your Excellency many Thanks for the Abb de Mablys Bookit is put in to the Hands of a Gentleman to be translated & published, under the Stipulations, you have prescribed. Will your Excellency give me leave to beg of you to direct the Publisher in Holland to inform Mr Debret in Piccadilly, when the Original comes out,2 for perhaps I may not be Able to do it, in Consequence of a Letter, which I wrote last Night to Mr Bridgen: a Copy of which I here inclose3
I have tried every possible Means to avoid coming to Extremities: but the violence of my Ennemies & the Coolness of my Friends are too great to bear
Should the worst happen to me, I trust your Excellency will not Suffer my Memory to be Insulted
May God bless you & yours in this sad World is the Prayer of / your Excellencys / Most Faithful Friend

Edm: Jenings
