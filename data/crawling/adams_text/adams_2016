Sir

       [ante 22 May 1779]1




I am honoured with your favor of the 2 Instant in compliance to which I have wrote to Cap Landais for Mr. T. Greenleafs passage.2
Inclose you will find the note of Sundry Articles which Mrs. Schweighauser has bought for Mrs. Adams amounting to 1730:16 which she hopes will meet with her approbation. This small Sum you will please to pay either to Mr. Odea or Messrs. Puchelberg & Co. at L Orient if convenient and if you had occasion on the other hand for Money I will write by tomorrows post to the latter to furnish it to you.
I am with much respect Sir Your mo humble obt. Servant

<J. Dl. Schw> Schweighauser
