Amsterdam, 24 May 1781. RC in John Thaxters handPCC, No. 84, III, f. 163168. printed: Wharton, ed., Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev., 4:431433.
In this letter John Adams provided an English translation of Amsterdams address of 18 May to the States of Holland. The citys deputies noted the ineffectual measures taken thus far to prosecute the war against Britain and particularly the inability of the Dutch navy to protect the nations commerce. Such a state of affairs was unworthy of the Dutch Republic and puzzling to the Northern Powers from whom aid was being sought. The only way to correct the situation was to enter into negotiations for an alliance with France, redouble efforts to convince the Northern Powers that their assistance was absolutely necessary, and make effective use of the nations resources against the British enemy. In his two final paragraphs (printed as one in Wharton), Adams called it a manly address, reflecting the old Batavian Spirit. It owed its appearance, Adams believed, to the presentation and publication of my memorial to the States General, which was more universally and highly applauded than was expected by me or any one else. Adams, like the Gazette de Leyde when it published Amsterdams address on 25 May, noted that there was no mention of the Dutch-American treaty proposed in his memorial. He attributed the omission to ongoing deliberations, but see his letter of 26 May to Dumas, below.
