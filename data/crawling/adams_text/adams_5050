Gentlemen
Auteuil near Paris Oct. 10. 1784



My Colleague Mr Jefferson, has orders from Congress to receive a sum of Money in Europe for his necessary accommodation, and not readily finding it, I have ventured to draw upon you in his favour for Six Thousand Florins which I request you to honour.1
I am requested also to draw upon you for about a Thousand Pounds sterling in favour of Coll Humphreys Secretary of our
[340]
Legation to enable him to execute Some orders of Congress and of Mr Morris.2 I have not ventured to draw for this, but desire to be informed whether you are in Cash to enable you to accept Such a Bill if I should draw it.
With great Esteem
