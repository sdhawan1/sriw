Passy, 22 May 1778. printed:JA, Diary and Autobiography, 4:110. Citing the usual practice under the law of nations of allowing six months after the commencement of hostilities for subjects of both sides to remove their property, Adams and Franklin requested that, if possible, the General Court return to Joseph Parker of London property seized by Massachusetts in the spring of 1775.
Whether recipients copy or draft, the letter (MiU-C: Presidents Collection) was begun by Adams and finished by Franklin. It has a statement to that effect at the bottom of the second page by Parker, who was to transmit the letter to the General Court (see Diary and Autobiography, illustration facing 4:131).
