Axminster in Devonshire 11. Febr; 1784.



As there is so little temptation, at present, to an englishman, to pay any attention to the wretched political informations of his
[31]
country, you will have the goodness to pardon me, Sir, if, not knowing whether you have a public character at the Hague, I am so ignorant as not to know if I have misaddressed you: At the same time, I must confess, that no punctilio of ceremony will restrain me from paying an instant & gratefull attention to the honor of your commands signified by your letters of the 31st. ult; brought me by this days post
The letter I formerly mentioned to you is copied in the inclosed paper; but on reconsidering it, I must own I rather incline to recant those confident expressions of its importance, in which I at first (in the zeal of my benevolence) proposd it to your notice.1
I will detain you no longer than to add, that could I have conceived a great minister of state to be accessible on the common terms of urbanity, like Mr. AdamsI would not have so long delayed, & consequently at last disappointed myself of the honor of, paying my respects to you in person:
I am, with the highest esteem, Sir, your obliged, / obedient and humble Servant

J. Cranch.


May I expect, my dear Sir, ever to have the pleasure of hearing from you again?
