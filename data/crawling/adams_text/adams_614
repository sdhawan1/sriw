There will be in a fiew Days a large No. of formidable works Compleated, and men sufficient to defind them.
The great fateague I have had thro the winter, and for about 3 weeks making preparation, and carrying on the Several works at Dotchester Point (by reason of Age and other inabilities of Col. Gridly who aforded but little assistance,) I was determined to leave the Service. But upon receiving your Letter, and the favourable Letter to Genl. Heath which were communicated to Genl. Washington, who Said, that he had wrote the Congress, that the pay allowed the Assistent Engineer was not equal to the service, and that he would write again, I was encouraged to come to this place, but however unequal to the Service my abilities may be, I am determined not to continue in it unless Some other provision is made for me.3 I am Sir your Most Obedient Humble Servant,
