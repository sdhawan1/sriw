There is this day a Confirmation of the News of the taking the fleet mentioned in my Letter1with this addition that there is 62 instead of 55 takenthey had great quantities of provisions and warlike Stores on board, a considerable quantity of Brass Ordinance also, which they were carrying to their fleets and Armiesthis Event is very unhappy for the English, and has sunk their funds. The Number of Sailors I know notwhether any soldiers or not I am equally uncertainit is however probable that there are many of both.
I have said in the same Letter that the Cte. DEstaing was to command the Combined fleetsI am not certain of thatthere is no End to the Reportsthat he is in Spain is certainevery thing else of him and the destination of the combined fleets is envelopped in Mysteries more perplexing than the prophecies. This being the Case, all one has to do is, to pray for more wisdom, and for the prosperity and success of him and the fleets.
