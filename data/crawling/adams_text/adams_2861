Sir
Amsterdam Novr. 6. 1780



Mr. Blomberg is so ill, that he cannot Speak, upon Business,1 which obliges me, to beg the Favour of your Advise, whether I ought to give more than according to the following Plan.


A

Interest
5 Pr. Cent Pr. Annum for 10 years.




To the House for negotiating the Capital
1 Pr. Cent.




To the Undertakers to furnish the Capital
1 Pr. Cent




Brokerage
 Pr. Cent.




And for the Yearly paying off of 10 Pr Cent.





To the House, of the Loan
1 Pr. Cent


B

To the Undertakers
1 Pr. Cent


C
Brokerage
 Pr. Cent


I had the Pleasure of half an Hours Conversation with Mr. Bowens, who desired me to consult with M. Blomberg and Send him my Conditions.
A Gentleman of great Worth and Skill, advised me, not to give more than four Per Cent Interest. America, is willing, however, to give a [327]just Interest, and all other reasonable Terms but She would not, like a young Spendthrift Heir, give any Thing, to get Money.
I am Sorry to give you, So much Trouble, amidst the Sickness in your Family. But the Sickness of Several Persons, upon whom I depended, obliges me to do it, and to request your answer as Soon as convenient. With great Respect, your humble Servant

John Adams
