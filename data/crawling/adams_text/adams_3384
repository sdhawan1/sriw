Amsterdam, 7 July 1781. RC and signature in John Thaxters handPCC, No. 84, III, f. 262263. printed :Wharton, ed., Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev., 4:550.
John Thaxter wrote this letter during John Adams absence at Paris. It contains an English translation of an article that appeared in Dutch newspapers, including the Gazette de Leyde of 10 July. The article was an account of a meeting on 8 June between the Marquis de Vrac, the French minister at St. Petersburg, and Count Osterman, the Russian vice-chancellor. The [404]French diplomat declared that unless the neutral powers took stronger measures to counter British depredations on their commerce, France would be forced to base its conduct toward neutrals on the policies Britain followed. Thaxter concluded by noting that Francis Dana had departed that day for St. Petersburg without Edmund Jenings.
