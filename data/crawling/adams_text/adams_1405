Versailles, 5 July 1778



As I am in need, gentlemen, of Captain Jones for a specific expedition, I would like him to remain here.
If it is not inconvenient, I would be grateful if you could leave him at my disposal and, if his ship must return to America, turn the command of the vessel over to his second.1 I have the honor to be with the utmost respect, gentlemen, your very humble and very obedient servant,

De Sartine
