Honourd Sir
Amstdm. 27 March 1781



May we begg leave to mention to Yor Excellency that nothing materiall hath happend Since ors of Yesterday. The greatest news we now mst expect from the Hage as or States will be Assembled, for we mst not mind for false reports, Sch as that which had been spread to day that [Vlissingen?] was taken by the English, by and by I hope we will learn not to be intimidated, and then see the Spirits of the Dutch people rise. The Captre of St. Estacia hath mch affected or monied people, and hindred s to compleat the whole loan, we are Sorry for it as it would have been a matter of as great an importance for the publicq as satisfaction to or Selfs, If we may carry all matters to or Wishes they will do well at the end. With all Respectfll Regard we have the honor to be Honourd Sir Yor Excellencys most devoted and most obedient humble Servants
