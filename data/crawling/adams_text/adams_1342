Passy, 15 June 1778. printed:JA, Diary and Autobiography, 4:135137. The Commissioners, in answer to Sartines letter of 6 June, indicated their reasons for refusing the drafts drawn on them by Bersolle, and, by implication and tone, their displeasure at Sartines interference in the Commissions affairs. The Commissioners further noted that it was highly irregular for merchants or naval captains to make drafts without prior approval and that the continuance of such practices would deprive the Commissioners of control over expenses and might ultimately result in their bankruptcy. The Commissioners declared their willingness to pay for goods supplied to John Paul Jones from the royal magazines, agreed that restitution should be made for goods stolen from the Lord Chatham by Jones crew, and reported their decision to send Lt. Simpson to America for trial. In addition, the Commissioners requested that the sale of the Lord Chatham and other prizes be expedited so as to provide funds for the Commissioners to defray the cost of keeping ships in port and for the captors to purchase necessities. Finally, the Commissioners acquiesced in the naming of Botsen, about whom they knew little, for possible employment by the French as a pilot on the American coast.
