Gentlemen
Paris Sept. 17th. 1778



I wish to have a conference with you on a Subject1 that very materially concerns our Country which at present is a profound Secret to our Enemies or their Agents and must remain so till compleated, or the success will be interrupted; any hour therefore tomorrow (at 12 oClock or afterwards) when you are alone, that you may please to appoint, I will do myself the honour of waiting on you, and in the mean time I have the Honour to be with great regard, Gentlemen, Your most Obliged & Obedt. Humble Servant.

W. Lee
