Sir
Paris July the 28h: 1783.


I have the Honor to inclose you a Letter received by yesterdays Post from England1
M Jay has already advised you of the arrival of M Laurens here. [179]He returns tomorrow by the way of Havre I do learn that anything is new is stirring He thinks there will be a change in Ministry If there is I imagine it will only be a change to strengthen the Kings Party. They say little or nothing about the Treaty the Commerce or definitive treaty. M L. has some thoughts of his Sons going with Barney; but I do not believe he will He, himself talks of embarking from England in October.
M Barclay & M Hunt go for Havre to Morrow. I imagine Barney will sail immediately after they get there.2 I am informed he carries the Treaty with Denmark & another with Portugal. I have the Honor to be / Your Excellencys / Most Obed. & mt hbl sert
