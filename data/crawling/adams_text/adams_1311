Passy, 3 June 1778. printed:JA, Diary and Autobiography, 4:123124. The Commissioners, as a result of letters from Lt. Thomas Simpson and appeals by others on his behalf, determined that Jones treatment of Simpson was too harsh and desired that Simpson be allowed to give his parole and return to America, there to be tried by a court martial. The Commissioners also requested that Andrew Fallon, taken prisoner when Jones captured and then scuttled the brigantine Dolphin on 14 April, be permitted to give his parole.
Fallon, bound to Esher, Holland, to embrace a religious life, gave his parole on 11 June (Cal. Franklin Papers, A.P.S., 4:263,490; Morison, John Paul Jones, p. 135).
