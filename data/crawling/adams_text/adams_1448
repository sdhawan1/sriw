Versailles, 18 July 1778. printed: JA, Diary and Autobiography, 4:166167 (JAs English translation). For the French text, see Adams Papers, Microfilms, Reel No. 94. Sartine recounted reports that he had received concerning problems with the French members of the Bostons crew. Their grievances did not seem to be directed against Samuel Tucker, but rather concerned their treatment by the first lieutenant and two other officers over pay, shares in prizes, and the term of enlistment. Sartine asked that Tucker be sent orders to alleviate the situation and noted that facilities had been offered for the recruitment of new volunteers.
In a postscript Sartine reported that, in response to a letter from J. D. Schweighauser, he had sent orders to the admiralty officers at Nantes that should remove any problems connected with the disposal of the Rangers prizes.
In a second letter of the 18th (same, 4:167, JAs English translation; see Microfilms, Reel No. 94 for the French text) Sartine noted the presence in French ports of several American vessels that could be used in the Franco-American war effort, but which were idle. He asked that the Commissioners give orders to end their inactivity.
