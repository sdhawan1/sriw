Gentlemen
London December 14. 1783


I have received your Letter of the Second of December and am extreamly Sorry to learn, that a Number of Mr Morriss Bills have been protested.
You did very prudently in writing immediately to Mr Franklin, to [428]enquire if Mr Grand could afford you, any Assistance. I hope you have received a favourable Answer.
I am waiting for Answers from Mr Franklin to Letters written to him, to determine whether I am to return to Paris or the Hague. But I dont know that I could be of any Service to you, if I were in Holland.
With much Esteem &c
