Gentlemen
Amsterdam, 7 September 1778



We have just received from Mr. Whitall the book containing the promissory notes from Congress, along with their coupons and your signatures.1
Now all we require to begin their negotiation is your orders and instructions relative to the expenses and allowances that we may grant the buyers in addition to the stipulated 5 per cent interest.
We have the honor to be, very respectfully, gentlemen, your very humble and very obedient servants

Horneca, Fizeaux & Co.
