As the Transmission of the inclosed paper1 through the usual Channel of the Department of foreign Affairs would, on the present Occasion, probably be attended with great Delayand recent Intelligence of Military Transactions must be important to our Ministers in Europe at the present period of AffairsI have thought it would be agreeable both to Congress and your Excellency, that the Matter should be communicated immediately by a french Frigate dispached by Admiral deGrasse.2
Annexed to the Capitulation is a summary Return of the Prisoners and Cannon taken in the two places of York and Gloucester.3
I have added, upon the Principles abovementioned, a Copy of Genl Greenes Report of his last Action in South Carolina.4
