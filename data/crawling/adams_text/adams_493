Colony of the Massachusetts-Bay


To all whom it may concern
Watertown, Novem. 30th 1775



We the Subscribers, Members of the late Committee of Safety of this Colony, do certify, That Colo. Lemuel Robinson of Dorchester has exerted himself in his Countrys cause, perhaps, as much as any other Man in the Government, and so as, in our opinion, to merit much of his Country, and said Committee did all in their power to obtain the Command of a Regiment for him, in the Colony Service, but thro an unhappy mistake, some misrepresentations of Facts prevented its taking place.
