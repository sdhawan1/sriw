The Hague, 2 April 1782



I had proposed, sir, to spend a few days in Amsterdam at the end of this week, but I am absolutely obliged to remain here and will have the honor of informing you of the reasons. In the meantime, I want very much to speak with you and pray that you would come to The Hague unless you are indispensibly detained at Amsterdam.1
[381]

Receive, sir, a new assurance of the inviolable sentiments of attachment and consideration with which I have the honor of being your very humble and very obedient servant.
Le Duc De La vauguyon
