Paris, 23 April 1780. LbC (Adams Papers).
Although a note to the Letterbook copy of Adamsletter of 3 May to the president of Congress (No. 58, calendared, below) indicates that this letter was sent and the Journal of Congress shows it to have been received on 19 Feb. 1781 (JCC, 19:175), no copy has been found in the PCC. With this letter John Adams enclosed newspapers from Britain, France, and elsewhere concerning events in England, where the old Monarchy seems to be tumbling about their Heads.
