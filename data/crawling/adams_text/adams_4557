St: PetersbourgApril 28th. 1783. OS [9 May N.S.]



The post of the 21st. inst: brt Mr: Thaxters Letters of the 31st. of March, and 3d. of April; by which I find you had received mine of the 24th. of Feby: informing you that I had that day communicated my Mission to the Vice Chancr: and the reason why I did it.1 The Contents of this packet will therefore much surprise you. You will be ready to ask what has since taken place. I only answer the first objection Cause assigned, at present. Hereafter I may attempt to account for so unexpected an Event I have only to pray you if Mr: T. has leisure, to desire him to make out a copy of the Memorial, and of my Letter to the Vice-Chancellor accompanying it.2 You will be pleased to forward this packet, which you are desired to read, by the first occasion. From your Friend & humble Servant.

P. S. Send no more Letters on to me here, unless I shortly request you to do it.
