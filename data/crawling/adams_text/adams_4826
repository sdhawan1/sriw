Sir
Amsterdam 4 febr 1784



The Houses send to your Excellency the Sheme of the projected Loan, but in order to Leave you to Judge of it, that it agrees with one at 6 Per C: intrest, we need to hand your Excelly. the explication of it; but as it is a work of our invention, we find not proper to give the explication of it to our neighbours, and we pray there fore to keep it Secreted, the more as they comprehend it against 6 Per C:, but youll reflect that a ballance of  47844:14. is Safed, whch. we regulated also, in order to fund Largely out of it, the higher allowance of 6 instead of 4 1/2 Per C: premium for the charges.
Your Excellencyll be pleased to reflect, that by the principal of two millions yearly is added 6 Per Ct. intrest, whch. wanted to be payed in case it was plainly to be negotiated at that term, and is yearly deducted the 4 Per C: intrest, whch. now in reality is payed, the amount intrest whch. the 2 Per C: we pay less, saves, compose the prices to be drawn in obl: at 4 Per C: intrest from 1785 to 1797, and the gratifications promised at the redeeming, so youll reflect that every year that sums become redeamable, we deduct the principal sum only of the first colom, and the Sum with the
[10]
gratifications of the secd: colom, whch. enjoys then a ballance as mentioned more favourable, than if really borrowed at 6 Per Ct. 1
We should think very good you desired the Houses to let the subscription be only at our House, but however this would be favourable to it, we may not propose it to them to avoid their displeasure.2
We pray your Excellency to mention nothing of this letter, in your answer to the houses and to believe us with real esteem. / Sir / Your Excellencys Most / Humb & Obedt Servants

Wilhem & Jan Willink
