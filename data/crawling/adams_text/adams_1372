Passy, 23 June 1778. printed: JA, Diary and Autobiography, 4:140141. The Commissioners, noting Schweighausers letter of 18 June (not found) and their instructions to John Paul Jones and Abraham Whipple of 16 and 23 June respectively (for both, see instructions to Jones, 16 June, calendared above), enclosed resolutions of the congress on the disposition of prizes (probably those of 23 March and 30 Oct. 1776, JCC, 4:229232; 6:913) for Schweighausers use in disposing of prizes of the Ranger and Providence and informed him of the possibility of a [232]prisoner exchange. Finally, he was ordered not to send the Commissioners circular letter of 10 June announcing the recall of Byrons fleet because it had since sailed.
For a possible postscript to this letter, see the Commissioners to Schweighauser, 10 June (calendared above).
