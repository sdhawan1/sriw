Boston, 17 December 1770. RC (MeHi). Printed: Franklin, Papers, 17:301304. Prepared by a Committee of Correspondence appointed 7 November composed of Thomas Cushing, John Hancock, Stephen Hall, Samuel Adams, and JA. Although Boston was used in the date line, the House was still meeting in Cambridge.
This committee was to communicate such Intelligence as may be necessary, to the Agent and others in Great-Britain; and also to the Speakers of the several Assemblies thro the Continent, or to such Committee of Correspondence as they have, or may appoint (Mass., House Jour., 17701771, p. 139). The first letter sent to Franklin, the newly appointed agent in London for the House, is the only one of the committees letters known to survive.
