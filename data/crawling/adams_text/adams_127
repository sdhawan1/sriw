23 October 1770. MS not found. Printed: Mass., House Jour., 17701771, p. 111. Prepared by a committee appointed 17 October composed of Samuel Adams, JA, James Warren, John Hancock, and James Prescott (same, p. 101).
In his speech at the opening of the General Courts third session (27 Sept.), Hutchinson announced that provincial troops had been withdrawn from Castle William and, by order of the Crown, replaced by British regulars (same, p. 81). The House expressed indignation at the very false Representations that presumably had persuaded the King to take this step and demanded to know whether Hutchinson still commanded the post or whether Castle William had been transferred from civilian to military jurisdiction (same, p. 9495).
When Hutchinsons reply to the House (17 Oct.) did not satisfy the representatives, they named the committee described above. The committees report proposed a message demanding that Hutchinson in an explicit Manner assure us, Whether you still hold the Command of his Majestys Castle-William. Hutchinsons reply is printed at p. 112113.
