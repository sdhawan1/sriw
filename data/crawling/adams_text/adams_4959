Altho I Have not Been Honoured with an Answer to My last letter,1 I will not lose time in Acquainting You that My departure from lorient is fixed on the 22d insant Any letter from You that Reaches
[227]
Paris Before the 17th will Be Carefully forwarded By me, and in Case You Had Any to send Clear of post offices, their Being put into My Hands will insure their Being Safely delivered to the persons to whom they are directed
We Have letters from America as late as the 20th April Nothing Had Been as Yet Settled By Congress Respecting their political ArrangementsUnless Some passenger is on the Road with More particular dispatches than those which Have Been Received By postBut I Rather think Nothing Had Been done in that Respect
With an affectionate Regard I Have the Honour / to Be / Dear Sir / Your obedient Humble / Servant
