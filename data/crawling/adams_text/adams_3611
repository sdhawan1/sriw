Sir
Passy, Jan. 11. 1782



Your Excellency will see by the within1 the Situation I am in, and will thence judge how far it may be proper for you to accept farther Drafts on Mr Laurens, with any Expectation of my enabling you to pay them, when I have not only no Promise of more Money, but an absolute Promise that I shall have no more. I shall use my Endeavours however, but am not sure of Succeeding, as we seem to have done what I long feard we should do, tird out our Friends by our endless Demands to pay Drafts unexpected and boundless. With the Million mentioned I can continue paying to the End of February, and then, if I get no more, must shut up Shop. I have the honour to be, with great Respect, Sir, Your Excellencys most obedient and most humble Servant

B Franklin
