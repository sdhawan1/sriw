May it not displease Yor Excellency; that forwarding the inclosed Letters,1 we repeat again or reqest, that we may be favoured with the rettrn of a few bonds, as to be in the possibility to deliver them when asked for; we were obliged to promise two of them for Wednesday next; so we begg to receive them before that time and some more as soon as convenient; we have seen by the publicq papers the Broker Yor Excellency chose to employ,2 and wish all may do well in time; we have obtained nothing from ors butt good promisses as yett.
May the Vigouros measres, their H. M. declare in their Manifesto to be forced to adopt against England safe and establish the honor of the Republicq, in which the Spirit of the people in generall flatters or hopes.
We have the honor to be with the most devoted regard, Honourable Sir Yor Excellencys most Obedient and most humble Servants.
