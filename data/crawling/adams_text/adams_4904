Sir
The Hague April 10. 1784.



I have the Honour to inclose to Congress a Copy of a Letter from the Baron De Thulemeier, and a Copy of a Project of a Treaty transmitted to me, by the order of the King of Prussia.1 I Should hope it might be examined in Congress or by a Committee and that Instructions may be sent, concerning any Changes to be made in the Articles, together with a Commission to treat and conclude to Such Persons, or Person as Congress Shall please to appoint.
With the greatest Respect, I have the / Honour to be Sir your most obedient / and most humble Servant

John Adams.
