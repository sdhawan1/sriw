Paris, 29 April 1780. RC in John Thaxters hand (PCC, No. 84, II, f. 12). LbC (Adams Papers); marked: 56. printed:Wharton, ed., Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev., 3:640.
Congress received this letter on 16 October. Relying on newspaper accounts, John Adams reported on the number and size of the warships forming the fleets commanded by Como. Robert Walsingham and Rear Adm. Thomas Graves and their departure on 8 and 11 April respectively. He then estimated the strength of the British West Indian fleet if the vessels under Walsingham and Graves were joined with those commanded by Rodney and Vice Adm. Sir Hyde Parker, the British commander in the West Indies. Adams noted, however, that there were conflicting rumors about Graves destination. Finally, he told of the return of the fleet under Walsingham, reportedly because a French fleet was in its path (see Edm Jacques Genets letter of 29 April, below).
