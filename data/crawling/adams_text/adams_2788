Letter 17


Sir
Amsterdam October 26. 1780



The Seventeenth, Inquiry is whether We have any Information that we can rely on, concerning the Population? has it increased or diminished, Since the War?

In some former Letters, I have made Some Observations upon the Subject of the Increase of Mankind in America.1
In the Year 1774, There was much private Conversation, among the Members of Congress, concerning the Numbers of Souls in every Colony. The Delegates of each, were consulted, and the Estimates made by them were taken down as follows.2


In New Hampshire

150,000


Massachusetts

400,000


Rhode Island

59,678


Connecticut

192,000


New York

250,000


New Jersey

130,000


[241]


Pensilvania and Delaware

350,000


Maryland

320,000


Virginia

640,000


North Carolina

300,000


South Carolina

225,000



Total
3,026,678


This however, was but an Estimate, and Some Persons, have thought there was too much Speculation in it. It will be observed, that Georgia, was not represented in the first Congress, and therefore is not included in the Estimate.
In a Pamphlet published in England about a Year ago, intitled A Memorial to the Souvereigns of Europe, on the present State of Affairs, between the old and new World, written by Mr. Pownal, a Member of Parliament and formerly Governor of Massachusetts and Lt. Governor of New Jersey We are told that3 The Massachusetts, had in the year 1722, 94,000 Inhabitants, in 1742, 164,000in 1751, when there was a great depopulation both by War and the Small Pox 164,484in 1761216,000in 1765, 255,500in 1771292,000in 1773 300,000.
In Connecticut, in 1756, 129,994in 1774257,356. These Numbers are not increased by Strangers, but decreased by Wars and Emigrations to the West ward, and to other States: yet they have nearly doubled in Eighteen Years.
In New York in 175696,776in 1771168,007 in 1774182,251.
In Virginia in 1756173,316in 1764200,000in 1774300,000.
In South Carolina in 175064,000, in 1770115,000.
In Rhode Island in 173815,000, in 174828,439.
As there never was a Militia, in Pensilvania, before this War with authentic Lists of the Population, it has been variously estimated on Speculation. There was a continual Importation for many years, of Irish and german Emigrants, yet many of these Settled in other Provinces: but the Progress of Population, in the ordinary Course, advanced, in a Ratio, between that of Virginia and that of Massachusetts. The City of Philadelphia, advanced more rapidly. It had in 17492076 houses. In 1753, 2300in 1760, 2969in 17694474From 1749 to 1753 from 16 to 18,000 Inhabitants, from 1760 to 1769 from 31,318 to 35,000.
There were in 1754 various Calculations, and Estimates made of the Numbers, on the Continent. The Sanguine, made the Numbers, [242]one Million and an half. Those who admitted less Speculation into the Calculation, but adhered closer to Facts and Lists as they were made out, Stated them at one Million two hundred and Fifty thousand. Governor Pownal thinks that 2,141,307 would turn out nearest to the real Amount in 1774. But what an amazing Progress, which in Eighteen Years, has added a Million to a Million two hundred and fifty Thousand altho a War, was maintained in that Country, for Seven Years of the Term. In this View one Sees a Community unfolding itself, beyond any Example in Europe.
Thus you have the Estimates made by the Gentlemen in Congress in 1774, and that of Governor Pownal, for the Same Epocha. That made in Congress is most likely to be right. If in their Estimate Some states were rated too high, it has been since made certain that others were too low.
But admiting Mr. Pownals Estimate to be just, the Numbers, have grown, since 1774 So much notwithstanding the War, and the Interruption of Migrations from Europe, that they must be well nigh three Millionsif the Calculation, made by the Members of Congress was right, the Numbers now, must be nearer four millions than three millions and an half.
I have observed to you in a former Letter that, the Massachusetts Bay, has been lately numbered and found to have increased in Numbers, as much as in former Periods, very nearly.4
I now add that Delaware, which in 1774 was estimated at 30,000 but upon numbering the People Since, they appeared to be 40,000.
<Rhode Island also in 1774>. Pensilvania is undoubtedly set too low in both Estimates.
I have the honour to be, very respectfully &c.

John Adams
