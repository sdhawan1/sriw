My dear Sir
Boston June 4th. 1781



It is some Time since I wrote to you, and much longer since I have been honoured with a Line from you.1 I have but Just got to Town. Mr. George Storer who goes by the way of Denmark is on the point of sailing and I can only Inclose two papers received from Mr. Lovel, and the Boston Papers of the day.2 I shall write you soon and if you have not forgot that there is such a Man in the world perhaps you will again write to your Sincere Friend & Humbl. Servt. J Warren3
