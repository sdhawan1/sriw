Passy, 10 July 1778. printed: JA, Diary and Autobiography, 4:156158. Adams reported the arrival on 8 July of the ratified Franco-American treaties, which were seen as fresh evidence of the increasing isolation of Great Britain and of the unlikelihood of the formation of a coalition of powers against America. He predicted that even Spain would soon join Britains open enemies and declared that the British government had but one wise choiceto make a treaty with the United States on the order of Frances with America. Adams believed, however, that Britain would remain blind to the need for a new policy and would decline to a second-rate power.
