Sir,
at the Hague Dec. 28th. 1784



Permit me to answer briefly in poor English, your favour of the 11th. inst.
An Ideot, no. Lunatick, may be for what I know. With me, and other plain people, the character is that of a bad man, near to become a Madman by disappointment.1
I am not misinformed, concerning the pretended principle and motive of a certain metaphysical Distinction. The nonsense I told you has been really alledged in private conferences previous to certain ministerial ones.
I am glad to hear of your proposals accepted. But the agreement of what may be looked on as convenient for the present, does not exclude mental reservations.
I am deeply initiated since some weeks in the secret of this and several other States, and would tell you at your fire-side, a number of important things, which are not to be trusted to the paper.
Our respects and good wishes to your Excellency and to your dear Ladies and Son. / y. E. / very humble & very / obedient servant

D
