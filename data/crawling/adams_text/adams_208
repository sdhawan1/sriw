Sir

       ante 19 July 1774
      



This may serve to apologize for so ungenteel a piece of Conduct as the carrying away a Sum of Money ( 13.8lawful) which I have received in your behalf. Nothing but absolute necessity could have forced me to do it but as I am leaving my friend you will not wonder that I wanted money which could not otherwise be procured. I have stated the matter in a letter I left for my father.

I am with much respect, your most Obed Servt.,
EDW. Hill1
