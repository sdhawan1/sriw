Braintree, October? 1758. Printed: JA, Earliest Diary, p. 6465. It is difficult to believe that this draft or retained copy was copied off and sent to Wentworth, because its first paragraph announces the same momentous personal news announced in the opening paragraph of the letter preceding, which is known to have been sent to and received by Wentworth. It is possible that this letter and perhaps others drafted in JAs Earliest Diary were simply epistolary exercises, not intended to be sent in their present form.
