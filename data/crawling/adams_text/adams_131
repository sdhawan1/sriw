MS not found. Printed: Mass., House Jour., 17701771, p. 171172. Prepared by the committee on the state of the province, appointed 16 October (see calendar entry for 16 Nov., above).
After its exchange of messages with Hutchinson on the Castle William controversy in mid-October (see calendar entry for 23 Oct., above), the House ordered the committee on the state of the province to take affidavits from Capt. John Phillips, former commander of the fort, and from Stephen Hall, former chaplain of the post (Mass., House Jour., 17701771, p. 145). Hutchinson recalled that the House gave him notice by a committee, that they should proceed to examine witnesses present at the transfer [of Castle William], and that he might be present at the examination, if he thought fit. This he did not think in character, but did not think proper to interrupt them (Massachusetts Bay, ed. Mayo, 3:224).
The committee report based on these investigations was presented in the form of a message to Hutchinson. As adopted by the House on 20 November, the message remonstrated against the Lieutenant Governors having, merely in Obedience to Instructions, surrendered command of Castle William, a Power . . . which by the Charter is vested in [him] for the Safety of the People and prayed that Hutchinson would take effectual Measures, that the Power of garrisoning his Majestys Castle-William, may be restored to the Governor of the Province to whom it by Charter it belongs.
