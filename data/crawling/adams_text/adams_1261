Passy, 14 May 1778. printed:JA, Diary and Autobiography, 4:9899. Replying to MacCreerys letters of 25 April (above) and 3 May (Adams Family Correspondence, 3:12, note 2), Adams thanked MacCreery for his unsuccessful effort to find a pair of JQAs breeches, containing a sum of money, that had disappeared either at Bordeaux or on the trip to Paris. Adams then turned to MacCreerys warnings against Arthur Lee, given during Adams stay at Bordeaux (Diary and Autobiography, 2:304; 4:39, 68) and in MacCreerys letter of 25 April. JA declared that from all that he had seen, Lee was devoted wholly to the public interest and that, regardless of MacCreerys opinion of Silas Deane, who [114]had largely controlled the Commissioners finances during his tenure, a large sum of money had been spent and another was still owed and that he was unable to determine exactly what America had received for the expenditures. Finally, in regard to MacCreerys desire that one of the Delaps be appointed the continental agent at Bordeaux, Adams stated that such matters were in the hands of the Continental Congress and, in any event, John Bondfield was doing a satisfactory job. JA did not send this letter because, after considering its content, he concluded that it was inappropriate to air the Commissions internal disputes before a private person.
