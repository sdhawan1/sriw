17 October 1770. MS not found. Draft prepared by a committee appointed 16 October composed of JA, Timothy Danielson, and James Warren. The committees report, submitted the following day, was recommitted and, at [245]the same time, JA was excused from the committee with Samuel Holten appointed in his place (Mass., House Jour., 17701771, p. 101102).
The original committee was instructed to prepare an Address to Lt. Gov. Hutchinson, praying that he would be pleasd to appoint a Day of solemn Prayer and Humiliation to be observd throughout this Province (same, p. 98). There is no way of knowing how similar the committees draft was to the address on this subject adopted by the House on 23 October (same, p. 110). For Hutchinsons discussion of the political implications of the House request, see Massachusetts Bay, ed. Mayo, 3:244.
