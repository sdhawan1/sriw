Honourd Sir
Amsterdam the 7th. March 1781



May we begg leave to address yor Excellency again, as yesterday we chose to do it by the scoot for Safety;1 and now we may be something more explicit, as or Letter may go intirely Safe by Mr. Taxton, who we heard just now from yor Sr. John to be in town.2 If we had known this we Certainly would have shown them the required notice.
Then what we had the Honor to mention, was the overtre of a plan which had been made to s very particularly, and which very near agreed with that I had the honor to propose in ruff already; and I wishd to sbmitt more plain to yor Excellencys jdgement; this cannot be done So well in writing; and after confronting the intelligences yor Excellency will have gatherd already, and those we may be able to give; she will be able to proceed to such measres as she will think the most Convenient.
Secrecy is a great point, where for as yor Excellency proposed a travelling way of life, and only intended a little excrsion, I was less anxios in desiring her to honor s with another visit, to which however the time is not so exceedingly pressing as I suppose btt Yor Excellency should dispose there of to the utmost convenience; which we shall be glad to know, as it will direct s in keeping or sending the bonds, for a great quantity of which we are sorry to say we do not foresee Yett Such a great haste as we had wished, btt we are still in hopes it may come in Corse. With all devoted regard I have the honor to be Honourd Sir Yor Excellencys most obedient and most humble Servant

John de Neufville
