Paris, 3 March 1780. LbC (Adams Papers).
This was a cover letter for that of 2 March from Antoine Court de Gbelin to the President and Corporation presenting the first six volumes of Gbelins nine volume Monde primitif to the college. John Adams letter, except for the formal opening and closing, and excerpts from Court de Gbelins letter, are printed in note 2 to a letter of 13 Oct. 1780 from Edward Wigglesworth, treasurer of Harvard College, to AA (Adams Family Correspondence, 4:46). That note also contains an account of the means by which the six volumes reached their destination.
