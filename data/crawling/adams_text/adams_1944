Mr. Grand has the honour of paying his respects to the Honorable Mr. Adams and begs leave to observe to him that the gnral Account he requires Since his arrival untill Mr. Franklins new Commission would not agree with all those he has furnishd in that Interval and which being a Series of Accounts united together would be in Contradiction with that required.
It is not possible to dissect in this manner the gnral Accounts by [419]making particular ones without being exposed to several inconveniencies, besides the Accounts that  Merchant furnishes must agre with thos tht may have been already furnishd and his books, which it is not possible to do with the Account Mr. Adams desires, but this difficulty can be raised and Mr. Adams intentions equally fulfilld by furnishing Copies of the gnral Accounts and observing to distinguish by Mr. Adams name those Articles that <the> He has authorised by his Signature from those where he is not mentiond which will form a compleat Account, both General and Particular.2
