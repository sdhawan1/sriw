Passy, 13 July 1778. printed: JA, Diary and Autobiography, 4:159160. In reply to Coffyns letters of 7 and 9 July (above), the Commissioners noted the abundant Testimonies of your good Character and declared that their confidence in him was undiminished. He was informed that whatever news he had for America could be sent to James Warren or the Committee for Foreign Affairs or both, but that he should, above all else, insure that his information was authentic because misrepresentations were so common. As to the unemployed American seamen at Dunkirk, the Commissioners wished them to be employed as soon as possible in order to save expenses.
