Dear Sir.
The Hague Feby: 22d. 1784.



I am ashamed to have, let your Letter remain so long unanswered I did not know untill I recd it that you had paid for me the Rent or sent so many Parcells to America. There is a small Difference between your Account and mine, but yours may be the right one. if you can find it, consistent to come with Mrs: Ingraham and my friend Duncan and take a Dinner with me, or alone, I will pay you the Ballance here. if not I will write to Messrs: Willinks, Van Staphorsts & de la Lande & Fynje to pay you and take your Receipt, upon your Account, Copy of which you will be so good as to leave, with them to send to me with a Receipt upon it.1
I wish you and your Family all Happiness and particularly, a pleasant Voyage, whenever you go.
with much Esteem &c
