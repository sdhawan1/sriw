Gentlemen
Brest, 4 September 1778



In conformity with the orders that you had the honor to send me on the 15th of last month,1 Mr. Thomas Wilkinson left yesterday for the town of St. Paul de Lon, where he will live at his own expense. I have taken every possible precaution for the security of his person.
I await your orders, or those of Mr. Franklin, concerning your prisoners here, who are a great expense and cause me much annoyance and anxiety.
I am with much respect, gentlemen, your very humble and very obedient servant

Berub de Costentin
