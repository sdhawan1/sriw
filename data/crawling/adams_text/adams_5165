[564]
And whereas it may so happen that the other great and various Affairs which we have committed to the Care and Management of our said Ministers Plenipotentiary, may not admit of their meeting the Minister or Commissioners which his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Morocco may appoint to treat with them of and concerning such Treaty, at a Time and Place that might otherwise be most convenient; Therefore Know Ye, That we do hereby authorize and empower our said three Ministers Plenipotentiary, and the Majority of them, by writing under their Hands and Seals, to appoint and employ, and at pleasure to remove, such Agent in the said Business as they or the Majority of them may think proper; which said Agent shall have Authority under the Directions and Instructions of our said Ministers, to commence and prosecute negotiations and Conferences for the said Treaty, with such Person or Persons on the Part of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Morocco, as to our said Ministers or the Majority of them shall appear proper. Provided always That the Treaty in Question shall be signed by our said Ministers, but that preliminary Articles thereto, may, if previously approved of by our said Ministers or a Majority of them, be signed by the said Agent.
In Testimony whereof We have caused the Seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed. Witness His Excellency Richard Henry Lee our President this eleventh Day of March in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty five, and of the Sovereignty and Independence of the United States of America the Ninth.
