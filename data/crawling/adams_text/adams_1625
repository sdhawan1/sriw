Gentlemen
Paris 21st. Septr. 1778



I have received information that the Ship Nile, Captn. Goldsmith has been taken, and carried into Marseilles. She was bound from London to Leghorn, and had on board Twenty Packages of Baggage belonging to me. These Packages are marked, and numbered in the following1 manner AB A Monsieur Monsieur Antoine Martinelli Negotiant, pour remettre a Monsieur lAbb Niccoli a Livourne No. 1 a 20.
My own name does not appear, because it was apprehended that it might have occasioned the detention of the things at the Custom House in London. I am to request the favour of you to take such measures as you may think proper,2 that the above mentioned Packages may be delivered to such person as shall be authorised by me to receive them. I have the honour to be Gentlemen Your most obedient humble Servant
