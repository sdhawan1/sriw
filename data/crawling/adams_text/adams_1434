Dear Sir
Challiot July. 15th. 1778



I am so unwell to-day that I cannot stir out. Will you have the goodness to expedite what is necessary for Mr. Livingston and he will bring the Papers1 for me to sign. I suppose a Commission, Instructions and our Orders for his sailing will be sufficient. Adieu

A Lee
