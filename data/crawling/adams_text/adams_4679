Dear Sir
Newburyport August, 8th. 1783


I did myself the Honor of writing You from Boston, the 16th Ulto, and endeavord to give a general State of our public Affairs. Having retired to my Country Estate since the Adjournment of the General Court, which was a little before the date of my last, I have not had opportunity to acquaint myself of the present Sentiments of the people at large on the several Matters that had agitated their Minds, as mentioned in my said Letter In my Neighbourhood I am pleased to find the Inhabitants begin to view Things on a larger, and consequently less prejudiced, scale They feel the Necessity of granting Congress some Money, or a Power to collect some This Government has for near two Years collected only 50,000 of 400 thousand requiredAnd nearly despair of obtaing any Sum adequate to the necessary demands, in the usual way of taxation1 The longer a delay of supplies, the more dangerous the remedy of the defect
Sensible of the absolute Necessities of furnishing the public Chest, Congress, as I mentioned to you, pressed, in the strongest and most pathetic pointed Terms, the Attention of the several Legislatures to this Object& in a Pamphlet forwarded to Each of them, shewed the dangerous tendency of any further Neglects. Having an Oppy. by a careful Master of a Ship bound from this place to [210]London, who promises to forward a packett to yourself in a Channel that will avoid Postage, I enclose one of those Pamphletsalso another containing a Collection of Papers respecting the halfpay of the Officers, and Commutation thereofnot knowing but, by Neglect of those, whose proper Business it may be to forward all such public papers, authentick, You might be indebted to the public News-Papers for Intelligenceas has been frequently the CaseShould You have recived them from any other hand, be pleased to accept my Wishes to be of the least Service2
Having nothing worthy your Notice to communicate, I will not tresspass on your important time, any further at present, than to renew my Assurances of being, with the most unfeigned Regards / Dear Sir / Your affectionate Friend / And most hble Servant
Tristram Dalton
