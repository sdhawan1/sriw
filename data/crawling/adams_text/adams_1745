Sir
Passy Novr. 10. 1778



We have received your Letter of October the sixth, and wish it was in our Power to do more for officers in your situation than We do, altho that amounts in the whole to a large sum. But as We have al-[202]ready lent you as much Money as We have <lent>1 been able to lend to other officers of your Rank and in your Circumstances, <it is not in our Power>2 we cannot without a blameable Partiality <to> lend you any more. We, are, sir your most obedient humble servants3
