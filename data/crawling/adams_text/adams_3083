Honourd Sir
Amsterdam the 8th. Feby. 1781



After the late conference yor Excellency honourd me with, we should have had the honor to answer her most Esteemd favor sooner, btt I am confind to my room, and in want of some information abot the form of the bonds.1
As to the terms Yor Excellency pleased to fixe on the Loan, relating to or Comission, we can have no objection, we wish chearfully to comply there with; as also, to leave the disposall of the bonds or part of them to Yor Excellency or any other Minister here from America, We for or Selfs have no predilection for any broker btt those who may do the greatest service to the Loans.
The brokerage is in generall One half p. Ct. the allowance for the undertakers never fixed btt I dare say we shall not want to exceed mch there on Yor Excellencys expectations; though we have known severall loans in which extravagant premims were allowed; and if it may Succeed to or wishes and endeavors; we are sre to give yor Excellency all possible satisfaction.
With particular regard and veneration we have the honor to be Honord sir Yor Excellencys most Devoted obedient humble servants.

John de Neufville & Son
