In this letter, received by Congress on 31 July and read on 1 Aug., John Adams, using information in British newspapers, analyzed the events leading to Rodneys victory over the Spanish and his relief of Gibraltar. He then described resolutions taken by an Assembly at Dublin on 22 Feb., which called on Irish legislators to deny the right of the British Parliament to legislate for Ireland. Adams believed that this and similar disputes were evidence of the British Empires decline.
