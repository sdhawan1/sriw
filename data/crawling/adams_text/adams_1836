Sir
Nantz 19 December 1778



In compliance with your order1 I have made enquiries for a Vessell bound to Boston but have found noneduring my search I was told Yesterday that Cap. McNeil was lately arrived and imediately sent to know when he would take your few articles. He told me that it is true he offered it while his Ship laid at LOrient, but that since that time he had taken-in, goods and Passengers and that he had no room left. I expressed my surprize and represented to him that one hogshead more or less was not an object in such a Ship as his,but he repeated his refusalwhich puts me under the necessity of waiting for another occasion at which time I shall take care to have them shipt in due time. I am most respectfully Sir Your mo. humble & mo. obedient Servant

J. Dl. Schweighauser
