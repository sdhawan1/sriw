Sir
Auteuil near Paris Dec. 11. 1784



I received in due Season and in good Condition your Favour of the 7. of Nov. But Dr Franklin being confined to his House by the Stone, and Mr Jefferson in Paris, by other Sickness, I have been [th]e only American Minister who could move, and have been obliged to oscillate So much between Auteuil, Passy and Paris that I have had no Time to answer you.
I presume you must have been misinformed concerning the Principle and Motive, of a certain metaphysical Distinction, between Mr. Le Baron and Mr LEnvoye.1 because he2 gave me, expressly a different one. viz. that his Master expected, an official Annunciation from the United States. 2. because I dont take his Master to be an Ideot, nor Lunatick and he must be one or the other, to believe either the United Provinces or United States, Rebells, at this Day. He might as well imagine himself a Rebell against the Crown of France, because he governs in Germany, where Charlemain, who wore the Crown of France once Governed. 3. because We have made, through the Comte De Mercy the Proposit[ion] which Congress ordered and have received an Answer in these words Sur la Proposition des Etats Uni[s dAmeri]que Jai fait parvenir  ma Cour relativement a des Arrangements de Commerce  prendre entre les deux Dominations respectives, Je viens, Monsieur, de recevoir lordre, davoir Lhonneur de vous prevenir que Sa Majest lEmpereur a agre ladite Proposition, et quelle enjoint au Gouvernment general des Pays Bas de Soccuper des moens dy donner Suite.[]3
