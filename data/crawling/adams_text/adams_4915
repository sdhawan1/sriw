Sir
The Hague April 22. 1784



I received Sometime Since a Letter from an American Gentleman now in London, a Candidate for Orders, desiring to know, if American Candidates might have Orders from Prostestant Bishops on the
[174]
Continent, and complaining that he had been refused by the Bishop of London and the Archbishop of Canturbury, unless he would take the Oaths of Allegiance &c.1
Meeting Soon afterwards, the Danish Minister I had the Curiosity to enquire of him, whether Ordination might be had in Denmark. He answered me, that he knew not, but would Soon inform himself. I heard no more of it, untill to day, when the Secretary of his Embassy Mr De Rosenkrantz, made me a Visit, and delivered me, the Papers Copies of which are inclosed.2
Thus it Seems that what I meant as current Conversation, only, has been made the Subject of Deliberation of the Government of Denmark, and their Faculty of Theology; which makes it necessary for me to transmit it to Congress. I am happy to find the Decision so liberal.
I have the Honour to be, with very great / Respect, Sir, your Excellencys most / obedient and most humble / Servant

John Adams
