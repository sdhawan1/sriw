Having here observed a diligent attention to the sick and wounded, and a benevolent desire to make the necessary provi-[293][294] sion for the relief of the distressed as far as the power of the Brethren enable them,
We desire that all Continental officers may refrain from disturbing the persons or property of the Moravians in Bethlehem; and, particularly, that they do not disturb or molest the houses where the women are assembled.
