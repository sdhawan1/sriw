Passy, 9 September 1778. RC in Adams hand PPAmP. printed (with enclosure): Magazine of American History, 12:462463 (Nov. 1884). Franklin and Adams sent the Council a letter of 10 Aug. from Thomas Hutchinson to Dr. James Lloyd of Boston, concerning land owned by Hutchinsons sister, Grizell Sanford, and enclosing his and his sisters powers of attorney. Franklin and Adams had opened the letter because they believed it unwise to permit any communication from Hutchinson to go to America without examination, but left it up to the Council to decide what to do in the matter. No record of any action by the Council has been found.
