Honble. Gentlemen
Nantes Sept. 10. 1778



Monsieur Montaudouin has this Day received a Letter from Monsieur Kergariou Commander of the French Frigate Loiseau off Bellisle, informing him that the Guernsey and Jersey Privateers which infest this Bay, obtain Provisions at Bilboa under the Flag of the United States, pretending to be Americans.
I think it my Duty to give you this Information and hope some Means may be found to prevent further Imposition.
I have the honour to be with great Respect Honble Gentlemen Your most obedient Servant
