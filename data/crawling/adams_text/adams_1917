Dear Sir

       Feby. 6th. 1779
      



Least it might possibly have escapd the joynt notice of you and your Most worthy Colleague Doctr. Frkd I thot it most needful to inform you that from publick reports as also private opinions the Friends of Ama have but too much reason to fear that you have about you insidious and dangerous Parricides in the Persons of Freres Lee Men who readily adopt any Measures which may promote their own interest tho derogatory to that of their parent Country whose Indce intirely depends on a Harmony and Unity of Sentiment.1
Self preservation being the first Law and it being necessary to eat to live I heartily wish that no person whose indigent circumstances may expose them to corruption or Stock Gambling, may be in any manner employd by <you> Cngss during the continuance of this present dispute.
Pray be pleasd to acquaint G. Tailer that I advise him to return home by the very first opportunity for as poverty is shund as contagious he will not find a single friend when reducd to a single shilling. [393]When I wrote you my wishes to assist him I meant with your advice only.2 My best wishes attend you and your most worthybeing with great esteem Dr. Sr.
