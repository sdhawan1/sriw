I have just this Moment receivd your Excellencys Letter of the 23d. Instant, it Honors and flatters me much and is a fresh Proof of your Excellencys Partiallity for me. Your Wishes that I was better known to my Countrymen proceeds from your Goodness to meI well Know that you have taken every pains in your Power, that I should be so, but whether they are acquainted with me or not I shall serve them faithfully and affectionately.
I am happy to see the Massachusetts Constitution translate in all the foreign Papersit must necessarily draw the Attention of Europe to the new Legislators. It must see with Admiration that the Science of Government, founded on the Nature of Man is so well understood in the New World. They will Confess that the English Know nothing of it, and if your Excellencys Recommendation is Attended to, the Americans will improve the very language of that haughty People.
I will press to have the Translation come out as Soon as possible and beg to have some Copies thereof.
