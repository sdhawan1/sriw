Dear Sir
Boston June 16th. 1784



I cannot omit paying my most sincere Respects by your good Mrs Adamson whom and your amiable Daughter attend my best prayers it would have given me great Satisfaction to have offered them my Compliments, personally, before their sailing for Europe, Which I am deprived of by leaving Town this Evening May the Winds be propitious and every blessing be theirs
I have had the pleasure of writing You by several Opportunities since any of your favors have come to hand, which, whenever they do, afford me the highest Delight Not having my letter Book here, I cannot refer to the Dates of my last Letters, wherein I was very particular1
Our Politics are not yet settledand perhaps never may be The Republican or rather let me say the American Interest seems to gain Ground Congress have not yet made a Peace Establishment The Army is totally disbandedfor want only of Money I presume,except 80 Men to guard the Stores at West Point and Fort Pitt700 Men are required to be raised from the Militia of Pennsylvania N Jersey, N York and Connecticutt to guard our Out Posts2 The Delegates of the N England States successfully opposed the establishing an Army The Congress, or some principal Characters
[235]
therein, refused to grant some requests presented by the Massachusetts Delegates unless they would agree to the Establishment They did not and I hope never will
Congress adjourned the 3d Instant to the first of Novr, to meet at Trenton I beleive, leaving a Committee to sit at Annapolis in the recess
They have put the public Accounts, contracted during the war, into a better Train of Settlement
Enclosed is a Gazettee containing a List of the present General CourtWhose Opinions is scarcely yet broached3 I fear they are not so liberally disposed to the return of the Refugees and Restitutions required, as the Act. passed the last G Court indicateswhich Act &ca I did myself the honour to enclose to You in my last The People are not enough sensible of the importance of fixing a National Character
I find myself happy that a Commission is at Last filled up by Congress to Yourself and two other Gentlemen for the purpose of settling commercial Treaties As Events or Prospects in this Business may appear proper or worthy to communicate Youll render me great Service in forwarding them such Use shall be made of them as You are pleased to direct
Time, pressing me, does not permit my enlargingindeed my principal Wish in writing Yourself is to convince You how much I am / Your particular Friend / And most hble Servant

Tristram Dalton
