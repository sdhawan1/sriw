Sir
Passy, April 22. 1782



Messrs. Fizeaux and Grand have lately sent me two Accounts of which they desire my Approbation. As they relate to Payments made by those Gentlemen of your acceptances of Bills of Exchange, your approbation must be of more Importance than mine, you having more certain Knowledge of the affair. I therefore send them enclosd to you, and request you would be pleasd to compare them with your List of Acceptations, and return them to me with your Opinion, as they will be my Justification for advancing the money.1
I am very happy to hear of the rapid Progress of your Affairs. They fear in England that the States will make with us an alliance offensive and deffensive, and the public Funds which they had puffd up 4 or 5 per Cent, by the Hope of a separate Peace with Holland, are falling again. They fill their Papers continually with Lies to raise and fall the Stocks. It is not amiss that they should thus be left to ruin one another, for they have been very mischievous to the Rest of Mankind. I send enclosed a Paper, of the Veracity of which I have some doubt, as to the Form, but none as to the Substance, for I believe the Number of People actually scalpd in this murdering War by the Indians to exceed what is mentiond in the Invoice, and that Muley Istmael (a happy Name for a Prince as obstinate as a Mule) is full as black a Tyrant as he is represented in Paul Joness pretended Letter: These being substantial Truths, the Form is to be considered as Paper and Packthread.2 If it were re-publishd in England it might make them a little ashamd of themselves. I am, very respectfully Your Excellencys most obedient and most humble Servant

B Franklin
