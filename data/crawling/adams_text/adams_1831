Gentlemen
The Hague, 18 December 1778



I have seen our friend. There are two committees: one to work on the new British complaints; the other on the response to be given to the French Ambassadors mmoire, of which I sent you a copy.1 We will not know the result until next week.

The protest published by Amsterdam against the resolution of the 18th was sent to me so that I might send a copy to Congress. This important document is 20 pages in folio.2 I will thus have much work to do, first translating it and then having it copied in duplicate and triplicate &c.
If a satisfactory response is not made to France, Amsterdam will protest again.
