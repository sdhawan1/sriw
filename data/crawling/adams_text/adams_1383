Honorable Gentlemen
LOrient 29th June 1778



The Frigate Oiseau who convoyed a Virginia Schooner out of the Bay which I dispatched from hence, is returned yesterday with the prize Hope, John Poignestre Master belonging to Jersey, a privateer of six Guns, who had taken the Brig Sally Captain Rapeal belonging to the state of Massachusettes the 3d. of May, with a cargo of Rice and Indigo from Charles Town on public account, bound to Bilboa. On board of said privateer, the following [243]sailors belonging to Marble Head were prisoners. Thomas Collie, James Howard and John Towler, for whose liberty I applyd to the Commissary, who granted my request, and in order to save the expence that woud naturally attend their delay here, for an opportunity to return to their Country, I prevailed on the Captain of the Oiseau to take them to Brest and deliver them to Cap: Jones of the Ranger, who I make no doubt will receive them. I have the honor to be respectfully Honorable Gentlemen Your assurd hl St.

James Moylan [Jr.?]
