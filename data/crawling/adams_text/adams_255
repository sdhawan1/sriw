Virginia, 16 December 1774. LbC (MHi:Donations to Sufferers by the Boston Port Bill, p. 66); addressed: To Sam & Jno. Adams Esqrs at Boston; signed: John Tabb, of Amelia Ro Bolling, Jno. Bannister Dinwiddie.
This letter was addressed to the two Adamses because the writers knew of no particular committee to which the donation could be sent. The donation was described as a small Contribution of Grain from the Inhabitants of Amelia and Dinweddie Countys. The letter praises the people of Boston for their spirited conduct and their great perseverance in the Cause of American Liberty.
This letter was answered by Samuel Adams on behalf of the committee in February 1775 (LbC, MHi:Letters &c from the Boston Committee . . . respecting donations . . . , p. 124125).
