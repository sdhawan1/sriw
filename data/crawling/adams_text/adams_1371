Gentlemen
Brest Hospl. June 22nd. 1778



I would beg leave to inform You that in the Action with the Drake Sloop of War on the 24th of April last, I had the misfortune to lose My right Arm, and at the same time receivd a bad wound in My left Hand; but am now so far recoverd that it is no longer necessary for Me to remain in the Hospital. As I am renderd unable to serve My Country as heretofore should esteem it a singular Favour if Your Honours would provide a Passage for Me to America as soon as is convenient and the Indulgence shall be gratefully acknowledgd by Gentn., Your most obedt. & very humbl. Servant

Pierce Powers1


I had the Honour of Acting in the Capacity of Midshipman.2
