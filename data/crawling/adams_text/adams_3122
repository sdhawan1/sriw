May it please Yor Excellency! that we remove the dobts which are laying on or mind for two letters we received for her from France, and which we have send for again yesterday to enclose them by a letter we had prepared btt on which we gott only an answer today, that they were directed to yor Excellency, or Clarck had made the first mistake in sending them as usuall for which we begg yor pardon.1
The Notary Mylis mean while is preparing the form of the Bonds2 with a proper translation which will be ready for Yor Excellencys persal and a great many of the plans are already running abot, btt in Conseqence of them enqiries begin to be made for the translated power, which we all forgott before Yor Excellency left the town, we do not suppose this can do any harm as yett btt both Mylis and we are of opinion that it would be best if we could be enabled to have it deposited there on monnday next,3 we should be sorry this should prove any way inconvenient to yor Excellency in her intended Jorney; what Success we may further flatter or Selfs with, we will better judge off at the beginning of next month.
With all regard we have the honor to be most respectfully Honourd Sir Yor Excellencys most devoted and most obedient humble servant
