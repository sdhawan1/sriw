Dear Sir

Last Night I received your letters of the 10th. 1 and 11th. Inst: and am sorry you had the Trouble of writing to me about the Bills, which was owing to a Misstake made by the Gentlemen at Amsterdam In place of sending My letter to your Care, they addressd you directly on the subject Immediately on receipt of your resolution respecting the House at Auteuil, I gave Notice to the owner that I Coud not go on with the Engagement, I had made him written proposals which he accepted, But the Tradespeople were not begun to work, and I do not Expect it will be attended with any Expence
I am Sincerely Dear Sir / Your very obed serv.

Thos Barclay
