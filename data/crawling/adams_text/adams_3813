Madam
The Haye 5 April 1782



I am sorry it is not in my Power to agree to your Request in your Letter of this Days Date. But it is absolutely out of my Power, as I am obliged to remove from my House at Amsterdam, on the first of May. I have the Honour to be very respectfully Madam your most obedient and humble servant

J. Adams
