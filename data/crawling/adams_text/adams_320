Dr sir
Phyladelphia June 20th. 1775



I have lamented excessively the Want of your Correspondence ever since I have been here. Not a Line from Dr. Winthrop, Dr. Cooper, Mr. Kent, Swift, Tudor, from some or other of whom I was accustomed the last Fall, to receive Letters every Week. I know not the state, the Number, the Officers of the Armythe Condition of the poor People of Boston or any Thing else.
I have taken the Liberty to mention you to General Washington, for his secretary, which is a very genteel Placemy Brothers here very chearfully and unanimously concurrd with me in the warmest Terms. A great Interest is making however for Mr. Jos. Trumbull and for others. What the General will do I know not. I would have you wait on him respectfully, and welcome him to the Army, and enquire after my health and let him know that I desired you to call upon him. Invite him to your Fathers, and offer your service to him.1 You will be pleased with him. He is brave, wise, generous and humane. Our Army will be the best military school in the Empire.

John Adams
