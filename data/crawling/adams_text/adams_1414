Sir

        [ante 9 July 1778]
       



I submitted to Comte de Vergennes an excerpt from General Heaths letter which I have the honor to return enclosed. You will have seen that I have mentioned it in No. 46 of Affaires de lAngleterre et de lAmerique .1 The publication of No. 47 is but waiting for the first news which you will receive and wish to communicate to me as usual through the mail .2 This periodical pertains entirely to the American cause and the Commissioners. It is for this reason that it is in a position to appeal to the French public. I am with respect, sir, your very humble and very obedient servant,


GenetPremier commis des affaires etrangeres
