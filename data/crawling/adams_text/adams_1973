Dear Sir
Nantes March 28. 1779



I have not written to you since your Departure because I have not before had anything to communicate, and now it is probable you will have already heard what I have to say.
The last accounts from England inform us that Pondicherry and Chandanargor in the East Indies are taken by the English, after above two months Seige.1 The Papers say also that a french Man of War and a Frigate are lost on the Cape of Good Hope.2 Senegal is taken by the French,the Garrison at Fort James was so weakened by Sickness that it fell an easy prey.3
We have had besides the above a great many Bruits, but as they seem to have been calculated only pour faire du Bruit, I shall not trouble you with any account of them.4
I shall be exceeding happy to know if I may expect the pleasure of [18]seeing you here again being with great Respect Dear Sir Your most obed servant
