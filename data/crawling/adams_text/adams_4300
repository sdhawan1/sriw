We shall be obliged to your Excellency to be informed, if merchandises utensils &c of English fabriks can now be imported Safe in America, as Several Comodities, to whch. your Country is used, can be brought on better terms, and so as we suppose be more to the Taste of the Nation, than of other Fabricks.

We have the honour to remain with great esteem / Sir / Your most Humble and most / Obedient servants
