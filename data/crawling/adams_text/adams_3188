Honourable Sir
Amsterdam the 19 March 1781



May we thank Yor Excellency for the Obligations she was so kind as to retrn s by Mr. Thaxter. The best way we fond to remedy the doble nmbers we have send to yor Excellenc, would be that Mr. Thaxter nmberd ors again conformably in Cifer under or written nmbers, and signd them.
We had the honor to forward yor Excellency; No. 21 to 30, those may easily be Alterd in the Cifers we now received adding a Zero 0. to each.
No. 131 to 170. could be 231 to 270 altering the 1 of the hndreds only in a 2.
This will be more easy then to alter or written Numbers; and they may all frter be alike as we will contine to Number in Screptis, and in Cifer, we wish to have Yor Excellencys approbation there on, to prepare a larger quantity and to finish those we have received.
With the most respectfll Esteem we have the honor to be Honourable Sir, Yor Excellencys most devoted obedient humble Servants
