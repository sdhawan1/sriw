Amsterdam, 12 June 1781. RC in John Thaxters hand PCC, No. 84, III, f. 209217. printed : Wharton, ed., Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev., 4:495498.
John Adams provided an English translation of a piece that originally appeared in a Dutch newspaper, probably the Gazette dAmsterdam, but also was printed serially in the Gazette de Leyde of 15, 22, and 29 June. The article noted the accomplishments of the recently adjourned States of Holland, which included its consent to expand the army and approval of a loan to finance the arming and protection of the Dutch East India Companys vessels. The author then turned to a petition presented to the States on 6 June by merchants of Dordrecht, Haarlem, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam trading with Surinam. The petitioners, who also sought William Vs support, requested that the strongest possible efforts be made to protect the remaining Dutch colonial commerce because of its importance to the nations economy. The article noted that the petition had been referred to the colleges of the Admiralty for consideration.
