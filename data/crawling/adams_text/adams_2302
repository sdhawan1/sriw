In this letter, received by Congress on [86]31 July and read on 1 Aug., John Adams used material taken from British newspapers to describe the celebrations on 2 March at Dublin over the passage of the Irish Trade Bill and summarized in detail the addresses of both Houses of the Irish Parliament thanking the King for approving it. He also included the text of the instructions of 7 March from the Freeholders of the County of Dublin to their representatives, requiring them to seek the repeal of Poynings Law and concluded with a summary of other events showing Irelands determination to be free of domination by the British Parliament. For a discussion of Poynings Law, see vol. 8:370371.
