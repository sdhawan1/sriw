My dear Sir
Boston Octr 22. 1777



I write to you in Hast and Confidenceand beg you to conceal me when I speak with Freedom of Men and Things. After many Reports that Burgoyne and his Army were Prisoners of War, we [320]have this Day receivd the Articles agreed on between him and our General.1 Perhaps I may be mistaken, but my Joy is dampd by the Concessions G[ates] has made, considering how totally Burgoyne was in our Power. He and his Army are restord to Gt. Britain: They have a free Passage granted there upon Condition of not serving in America during the present War. They may then by this unaccountable Treaty, take the Place of Regiments in Britain, who may come to America, as early for Action as the surrenderd Troops could have been, had they winterd in Canada. I have seen only this first Article.2 I wish the others may be better. This alone chagrines me. You will have the Whole, and can judge better than I.3 In my present Opinion, Infatuation or something worse, dictated the Concession made to an Army, not a third of ours in Number;4 and in evry Circumstance of Desperation. I will write more soon. With the greatest Esteem and Affection Yours &c.
