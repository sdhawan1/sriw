This will reach yor Excellency at his levee, I make no apologie for not forwarding it sooner while by the time I left her, and being after supper reading for dissepation I received an Account of a tiding from Rssia, by which the Emperess offerd her mediation;2 if this should appear (in consequence of what yor Excellency was pleased to enforce upon my mind) countrary to the intrest of America, I dare Say we have gand a great point for both Countries, and if well managed may produce the greatest happiness; we may be degenated from the vigor with which our Ancestors have defended their liberty; butt yor Excellency will find in this Republicq many worthy people not a disgrace to an intimate Alliance with America, witness withot ceremony Yor Excellencys most devoted and obed hum servt.
