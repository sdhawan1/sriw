I have not had time to examine that Wine Yet but you may depend on all endeavours to get the most of it.
Being likewise without news I remain Most respectfully Sir Your most obt hble sert

Hy. Grand


I lately received a large packet containing smaller ones for you and M. Thaxter which I [have] forwarded but there remains a very big one which it would cost a great deal of Money to send by Post.2 It is directed to Messrs. J. Adams and Fr. Dana for publick service. For this last Consideration I should have sent it immediately had I not expected M. Danas arrival here soon, for which he desired me to send him no more letters to Amsterdam.
