Your Situation sir is very important, it is extremely critical. A Rupture between the Troops under your Command and the Inhabitants of the Province over which you preside, would produce Consequences of the most Serious Nature. A Wound which could never be healed! It would establish Animosities which no Time could eradicate.3
The Province of the Massachusetts Bay are by your own Acknowledgment, generally engaged in a Refusal to comply with the Act of Parliament for altering their Government.

We therefore intreat you sir, to desist from the further Fortifications of the Town, that the Jealousies and Apprehensions of the People, may be quieted and that they may not be driven to so desperate a step as that of quitting the Town and throwing themselves on the Charity of their Friends and Neighbours.4
