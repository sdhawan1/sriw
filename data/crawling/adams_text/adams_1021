Dear Sr.
Haverhill June 23d. 1777



My Brother, Mr. Christopher Sargeant, the bearer has occasion to travel to South Carolina, he is a Stranger in almost all places he has to travel thr. He has, a few months past, finished his Studies under our Brother Lowell. I think I can recommend him as an honest trusty person, and one that is a sincere friend to his country. He probably may stand in need of your favour and Patronage. Every kind Office you may do him, which from your general Philanthropy, I know will give you pleasure, will be esteemed a new obligation laid on myself. Am, Sr., with the sincerest respect, your Humble Servt.

Nathel. Peaslee Sargeant


P.S. Your late Letter to the council of Resignation1 gives me real pain, th such a chance for rising might give others pleasure, Yet I sincerely wish it might be recalled.
