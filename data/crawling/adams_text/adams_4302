My dear sir,
Paris. Novemr: 25th: 1782



Your favr: of the 17th. & the letters accompanying it are come safe to hand. I recd. too a letter at the Hague, but had not time before my departure to answer itanother here, but have been so much occupied as not to answ: that. Thus you have a Confession of my Sins of Omission1
Congress has given to Mr: Morris so entire an Authority over all monies, that I am fully Rilieved fm. all deliberations on that subject At this I rejoice, because it is the root of all evil in my mind, whatever others may think of it Perhaps I might think better of it, if I knew how, cleverly, to get a good deal of it
Make my Compts. to Grinnell & desire him to let me know, if he is going to Amsterdam before he returns, & if he will not take a Dutch Gouda Pipe with me at Paris, before he goes fm. you2
They have lately struck in Amsterdam, an elegant Medal in Commemot. of the great event of 19th. April. 1782. America & Holland are represented by 2. fine figures of warlike Amazons, embracing each other. Their swords & Spears & Cap of liberty are not forgotten & America is treading on the head of the Leopard On the reverse, is an Unicorn rushing head long agst: a monstrous Rockhis horn snaps short off to his head, & he falls stunned & confounded Tyrannis libertati repulsa3
One wd. think that, the horn being broken & the head crushed, it were time for the leopard & Unicorn to think of Peace; but I cant give you any strong hopes of this: On the contrary, dispositions seem to be making on all sides for another Campaign, with too much ardor, to admit of much doubt that we shall have one
Mr: Van Berckell & Van der Capellan de Poll are restored to their places & it is said Pinto has disappeared in Consequence of the Capture of a Packett-boat.4 If war continues, our dearly-beloved Mynheers will do something next year
Compts: to yr: family &c: &c:
