Sir
Richmond Oct. 2. 1780.



I am sorry to be obliged to inform you that it is out of our power to have paiment made of Mr. Clays draught for 225,000 dollars.
[4]
Our treasury is at present absolutely exhausted, and no prospect of its being replenished till the assembly shall have met and have had time to provide supplies. I hope this will reach you in time to prevent the additional disappointment which might arise from your setting out on your journey previous to your receipt of it.
I have the honor to be with the greatest esteem & respect Sir Your most obedt. & most humble servt.,

Th: Jefferson
