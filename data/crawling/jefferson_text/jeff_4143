Send me note of what will cost, except those which are at common prices and which may be boughtaccount of Virga. act for surrendering citizens committing offences in other countries. Made principally to restrain our people as to Span. settlements. Interest of both parties to keep peace, and is the wish of our government. Spn. no object in war, because we have nothing but territory which they cannot take. Their trade and their territory tempting to our people but not to our government. Wish they would authorize Ct. DAranda to enter into conferences so as to settle arrangement. We should then find no difficulty in going to Madr. to put last hand to it. [Sent this letter thro Mr. Grand]. Not found.]
