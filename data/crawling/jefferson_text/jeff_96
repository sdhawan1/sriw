4. The said Philip Mazzei is to invest or employ the Monies to be received, as he shall think best for the Purposes aforesaid, and to superintend the said Business, as Factor for the said Company, for which he is to draw from the Proffits, or principal Money paid, five per centum per annum, on the capital sum subscribed, besides being at liberty to use for his Table or Houshold, such necessaries, as may be raised on the Lands of the Company.
5. That any Lands, or other Possessions of the said Philip Mazzei, which he may at this time have, and which are proper for the purposes of the said Partnership, after being valued by three men indifferently chosen by the said Philip Mazzei, and any five of the Partners, shall be taken at such valuation as part of the said Philip Mazzeis subscription, and together with the Lands, Slaves, Servants, Utensils and other things to be purchased with the monies of the Company, shall become vested in the Subscribers, their Heirs, Executors, Administrators, or assigns, in proportion to the several sums they shall have subscribed.
