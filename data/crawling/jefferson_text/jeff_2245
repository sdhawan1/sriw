New Castle, 20 Feb. 1781. The 1,500 ordered by the Council to be paid to Syme for Waggonage of Stores is quite inadequate for his Cash ingagements; needs 1,000 more. Col. [John] Nicholas Writes Me He Has Your Directions, for releiving my Militia, from the Lower Battallion, Now On Duty, without Asertaining the Numbers; Syme desires more exact information. Congratulates TJ on the Arrival of arms and amunition, from the North.
