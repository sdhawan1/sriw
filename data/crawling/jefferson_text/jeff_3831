These are the questions, my dear Sir, which I have proposed to several Gentlemen of information, in order to get acquainted with the situation of affairs, and which will be answered to you much sooner than to a foreigner. At Boston I recommend you Mr. Russel, but generally I think it would be prudent to propose questions to several gentlemen at the same time. I pray you to communicate me the answers you will get in New York Boston Portsmouth etc. as I will show you greedily those I have got on my journey. Totus Tuus, Hogendorp
