[Richmond 14 September 1780]



Mr. Tate informs me you are now in condition to pay up the arrearages of animal food due the convention troops, but that he [649] supposed they would not receive them. If you be really in such condition I should be glad to have the arrearages tendered, and if refused a proper certificate of the fact, that I may transmit it to General Washington and prevent any disagreable consequences from the representations already forwarded to him.
