[Place not known, 2 Sep. 1780. In his letter to Samuel Huntington, 8 Sep. 1780, TJ enclosed a letter from Colo. White complaining of (a) limitation of price for horses purchased to remount Whites cavalry. Whites letter was read in Congress, and a committee reporting on it declared That the Style of Lt. Colo. Whites letter of Septr. 2d. 1780, which was addressed to the Governor of Virginia, is improper and inconsistent with the confidence which ought to be reposed in the Executive of a State, exerting itself for the advancement of the common good, by every means in its power (JCC, xviii, 850). Not located. See, however, TJ to the Persons Appointed to Purchase Horses, 6 Sep., and note on TJ to Huntington, 8 Sep. 1780.]
