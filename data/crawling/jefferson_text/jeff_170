[Before 13 June 1776]



Whereas GeorgeGuelph King of Great Britain & Ireland and Elector of Hanover, heretofore entrusted with the exercise of the kingly office in this government, hath endeavored to pervert the same into a detestable & insupportable tyranny
[338]
by <neg> putting his negative on laws the most wholesome & necessary for the public good
by denying to his governors permission to pass laws of <the most> immediate & pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation for his <con> assent &, when so suspended, neglecting <for m> to attend to them for many years:
by refusing to pass certain other laws, unless the persons to be benefited by them would relinquish the inestimable right<s> of representation in the legislature:
by dissolving legislative assemblies repeatedly & continually for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people:
when dissolved, by refusing to call others for a long space of time, thereby leaving the political system <[in a state of dissolution]> without any legislative <body> head.
by endeavoring to prevent the population of our country <by> & for that purpose obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners & raising the conditions of new appropriati<ng>ons <new> of lands:
by keeping among us in times of peace standing armies & ships of war:
by affecting to render the military independant of & superior to the civil power:
by combining with others to subject us to a foreign jurisdiction giving his <con> assent to their pretended acts of legislation <for imposing taxes on us without our consent.>
for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:
for <depriving us of> imposing taxes on us without our consent:
for depriving us of the benefits of trial by jury:
for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences:
for suspending our own legislatures & declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever
by plundering our seas, ravaging our coasts, burning our towns, <des> & destroying the lives of our people:
by inciting insurrections of our fellow subjects with the allurements of forfeiture & confiscation
by prompting our negroes to rise in arms among us; those very negroes whom by an inhuman use of his negative he hath <from time to time> refused us permission to exclude by law:1
by endeavoring to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an [339] undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, & conditions <of life> of existence.
by transporting at this time a large army of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, & tyranny already begun <in a stile> with circumstances of cruelty & perfidy so unworthy <a> the head of a civilized <people> nation
by answering our repeated petitions <against this repeated> for redress with a repetition of injur<y>ies: <with an accumulation of new injury>2
and finally by abandoning the helm of government <&> & declaring us out of his allegiance & protection.3
<[and by various other acts of tyranny too often enumerated to need repetition, and too cruel for the reflection of those who have felt them.>]
<Whereby it has become absolutely necessary> by which several acts of misrule the sd. GeorgeGuelf has forfeited the kingly office, and has rendered it necessary for the preservation of the people <that the said GeorgeGuelp> <it is become absolutely necessary> that he should be immediately deposed from the <kingly office> same & divested of all its privileges, powers, & prerogatives
And forasmuch as the public liberty may be more <effectually> certainly secured by abolishing an office which all experience hath shewn to be inveterately inimical thereto, <in which case it> and it will thereupon become<s> further necessary to re-establish such antient principles as are friendly to the rights of the people & to declare certain others which may <fortify &> co-operate with & fortify the same in future.4
And whereas by an act of []5 of the present parliament of Great Britain passed for the purpose of prohibiting all trade & intercourse with the colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusets bay, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the three lower counties on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, & Georgia it is declared that the said colonies are in a state of open Rebellion & hostility against the king & his parliament of Great Britain, that they are out of their allegiance to him & are thereby also put [out]6 of his protection: and <in one> it is further declared <in the said act> that as divers persons within the sd. colonies may have been destroyed for the publick service in withstanding or suppressing the said rebellion, it is therefore enacted that all such acts shall be deemed just & legal to all intents <& purposes> constructions & purposes to [340] which act the sd. GeorgeGuelp hath given his assent & thereby put us out of his allegiance & protection; in which case it is provided by the original charter of compact granted to Sr. Walter Ralegh on behalf of himself & the settlers of this colony & bearing date the 25th day of March 1584. that if the said Walter Ralegh his heirs or assigns or any of them or any other by their licence or appointment should at any time thereafter do any act of unjust or unlawful hostility, to any of the subjects of the sd. queen her heirs or successors it should be lawful to the said queen her heirs & successors to put the sd Walter Ralegh his heirs and assigns and adherents & all the inhabitants of the said places to be discovered as is therein described, or any of them out of her allegiance & protection, and that from & after such time of putting out of protection of the said Walter Ralegh his heirs assigns & adherents & others so to be put out, & the sd. places within their habitation possession & rule, should be out of her allegiance & protection & free for all princes & others to pursue with hostility as being not her subjects, nor by her any way to be avouched maintained or defended, nor to be holden as any of hers, nor to her protection or dominion or allegiance any way belonging so that the sd. GeorgeGuelp having by the said act of parliament declared us in a state of Rebellion & hostility & put us out of his allegiance & protection, it follows by the sd. charter that, from & after the time of such putting out, ourselves, and the places within our habitation, possession & rule are not subject to him, & are not to be holden as any of his, nor to his dominion any way belonging.
From all which premisses it appears that the sd. GeorgeGuelp, not only for his criminal abuses of the high duties of the kingly office, but also by his own free & voluntary act of abandoning & putting us from his allegiance subjection & dominion, may now lawfully, rightfully, & by consent of both parties be divested of the kingly powers:
