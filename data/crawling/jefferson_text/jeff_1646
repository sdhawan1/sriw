York, 18 Dec. 1780. Acted as brigade quartermaster to the troops which marched south under Col. Porterfield last May, and some time [215] after was ordered to Virginia to receive and forward on the necessary Cloathing for the Regiment of State Artillery, in which I have the honour to hold a Captains Commission. Is deeply concerned that he will not be able to serve much longer except I can be allowed the Benefit of such Privilledges as from my Rank as an Officer, I conceive my Self to be intittled to. Being considered a Continental officer, he cannot draw forage in Virginia except where there are Continental posts, and his expenses are thereby intolerable. Capt. [Edward?] Moody being about to visit his Family, is desirous of my taking care of the Garrison at York untill his return; upon this head I have consulted Capt. [Thomas?] Edmunds, who has no objection to my serving in the State, as we have many Officers at this time without any Command. Desires the governors approval of this proposal.
