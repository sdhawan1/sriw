[Williamsburg]  10 Sep. 1779. Haywood offers 2,000 bushels of salt at 20 per bushel. Without salt it will be difficult to purchase tobacco because of the shortness of the present crop and the amazing [86] depreciation of money. Without tobacco it will be impossible to procure goods. Signed by Whiting, Ambler, and Rose.
