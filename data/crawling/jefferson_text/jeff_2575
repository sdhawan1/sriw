Sir
New Castle 22d March 1781.



Mr. Daniel Trueheart thinks the Court Martial of Our County [210] Have Done Wrong, in placing Him on the present Tour of Duty. For Certain Reasons, it May be impolitick for me to intermeddle with His Case, therefore, Hope to be Excusd by Your Excellency for Referring Him to Yourself, Being wth Great Esteem, Sir Your Mo: Obedt. Servt.,

J Syme
