Sir
In Council Febry. 21. 1781.



The establishment of a Line of riders between Genl. Gregorys Camp and Suffolk is very necessary. I would advise you to purchase [675] horses for that purpose at any rate almost, rather than to impress. But if you cannot purchase they should be impressed. I think it would be better, whether you purchase or impress, that it be done in the neighbourhood of the enemy as much as possible, because horses are cheapest there and these are in danger of being taken by the Enemy & used against us.
I am Sr. yrs. &c,

T.J.
