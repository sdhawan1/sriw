Sir
Philadelphia 14th: February 1783.



I have delayed answering your favor of the 7th Instant until I could obtain the sense of Congress on the matter it contains. I conceive it hardly possible while the british Cruizers retain their present Station for you to elude their vigilance in either of the Ships offered to your choice. This concurring with the late advices from England, has induced Congress to pass the enclosed Resolution. We have reason to conjecture the peace is already concluded, whether it is or not a few days must determine.
I transmit the speech of his Britannick Majesty which with what you already know of the State of our Negotiations will enable you to form your opinion on the same ground that we do. I have the honor to be Sir with great Respect and Esteem your most obedient humble servt,

Robt. R. Livingston
