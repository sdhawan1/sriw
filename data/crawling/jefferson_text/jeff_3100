Sir
Charlottesville May 21st 1781



You will be pleased to order all Cattle and Horses which may at any Time be within twenty Miles of the Enemys Camp to be [4] removed beyond that Distance excepting only such Horses as are unfit either for Cavalry or Artillery. Should the Owners not perform this Order within such short and reasonable Time as you shall prescribe, you will be pleased to order out proper Officers and men of your Militia to carry such Horses and Cattle to the Marquis Fayettes Head Quarters for the use of our Army having them duly appraised. I am &c.,
 Thomas Jefferson
