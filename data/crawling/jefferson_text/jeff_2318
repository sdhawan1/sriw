Without place, 27 Feb. 1781. Mr. Smith of Loudoun County waits on you with the inclosed Certificate and prays a Warrant on the Treasury [18] for Payment; but has agreed with me in presence of Col. Brooke not to solicit Payment before the 10th. of April next. As Smiths wagon and geer are perfectly new, Rose thought it best to purchase them, reserving the Right of submitting it to your Excellency either to approve or disapprove the Bargain.
