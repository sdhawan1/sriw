Dr. Sir
Paris Mar. 3. 1785.



An unfortunate change in my domestic situation by the loss of a tender connection who joined me in esteeming you, occasioned me to wish a change of scene and to accept an appointment which brought me to this place and will keep me here some time. Since your departure from America I have been altogether uninformed of your subsequent history. I am sure I need not tell you that the regard I entertain for you has rendered that interesting to me. A vague report of your death which was never so authenticated as to command belief, but which has not been authentically contradicted has particularly occasioned me to wish the pleasure of a line from yourself. Till this or some other assurance of your being still on this side the Styx, I shall indulge no further the feelings of friendship which would only render my pen more diffuse, but conclude with an assurance of the esteem and regard with which I have the honr. to be Dr: Sir Your affectte. hble servt.
