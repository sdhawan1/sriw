Sir
[ca. 16 January 1781]



The Executive will undertake to impress any boats which may be necessary in the opinion of the military officers. We are endeavoring here to build some light boats for transporting troops across the river. But they are not to be waited for or depended on. I am with esteem Your most obedt. servt.,
