In Council Feb. 3. 1781.



The board approve of letting the building on the within terms, only postponing the advance of the money mentioned till the raising of the house. They recommend the providing the works for boring a single cannon at a time only, which will probably render all geer unnecessary except a water wheel. The size of the house should be reduced so as only to comprehend the works and leave necessary room for the workmen: or if raising a house on the old walls will render this as cheap, as building a smaller house on new walls, the spare room should be applied to some other purpose.
