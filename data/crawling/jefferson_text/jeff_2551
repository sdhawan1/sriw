Sir
Richmond March 21st. 1781



Certain information of the arrival of an Enemys Fleet in the Bay renders it necessary that we take immediate measures for withdrawing the vessels, Stores and Public Property from the Shipyard. This cannot be done without assistance. I must therefore desire you instantly on receipt of this to send fifty militia there to assist under the directions of Captain Maxwell in that most important work. This Service shall be considered [as] our Calls on your County for militia. I am &c.,

T. J.
