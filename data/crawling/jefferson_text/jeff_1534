Richmond, 19 Nov. 1780. The first paragraph of this letter is identical with the first paragraph in TJs letter to Gates of this date, except that after coming up James river TJ here adds: or I suppose any other of the waters of the Chesapeake. The second paragraph of the letter to Lee is identical with the second paragraph of TJs letter to Huntington of this date, except that it lacks the last sentence of that paragraph as written to Huntington. The third paragraph is the usual complimentary close.
