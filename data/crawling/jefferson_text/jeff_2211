Sir
Richmd. Febry. 18. 1781



Not knowing where the very rapid march of Ld. Cornwallis may terminate I think it necessary to desire that you immediately assemble [647] the whole of your Militia who have arms, or for whom they can be procured by impressing or otherwise and march them with proper officers without delay to join Genl. Greene who by the last intelligence had crossed the Dan at Boyds ferry and was retreating before the enemy. The emergency is so extreme that I must rely on your losing not a moments time in executing this order. I shall be glad to be informed of the numbers you equip and time of their march. I am with much respect &c.
