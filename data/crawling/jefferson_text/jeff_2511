Sir
In Council Mar. 17. 1781.



The inclosed act of Congress will inform you of the final ratification of the Confederation of the thirteen United states of America. I beg leave to congratulate the General assembly on this very important event, by which a firm bond of Union is drawn on these states, our friends enabled to repose confidence in our engagements, and our enemies deprived of their only remaining hope.
I have the honor to be with sentiments of the highest respect & esteem Sir Your most obedt. & most humble servt.,

Th: Jefferson
