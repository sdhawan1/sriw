Had the Baptists been backward as is alledged, no doubt but they would have smarted for it, by the late Act for pitching upon Men to fill up the last 6 Regiments, but there were no Baptists nor Baptists Sons pitched upon in the Counties of Amelia and Orange, where we reside, nor for ought we know any thing else.
