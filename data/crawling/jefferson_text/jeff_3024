Dear Sir
May 4. 1781.



You shall receive the money necessary for the purchase of the horses as fast as it can be prepared and as shall be practicable in concurrence with other pressing claimants. You know how difficult it is to fix on precise days for the treasury. Therefore all I can say with precision is that it shall be paid out of the present emission.
