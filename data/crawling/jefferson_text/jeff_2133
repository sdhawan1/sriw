[Richmond, 13 Feb. 1781. Minute in Va. Council Jour., ii, 292: Tuesday February 13th 1781  Letters of this date from the Governor to General Greene, Colonel John Gibson, and Colonel Brodhead, on the Subject of the Western Expedition  being read, are approved, and ordered to be registered. No such letter from TJ to Greene has been found and none of this date was acknowledged by Greene. It is probable that the clerk of the Council mistakenly wrote Greene while intending to write Clark, since TJ on 13 Feb. wrote George Rogers Clark on the Subject of the Western Expedition. The letter to Clark and all others concerning the Western expedition are transcribed in the Executive Letter Book, but there is no file copy of a letter to Greene of this date.]
