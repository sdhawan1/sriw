We have this moment learnt that there is in possession of Colo. Gibson at Fort Pitt or his Pay-master a quantity of Clothing fit for Soldiers: As Majr. Slaughters Corps we know is in want, and yours may possibly be, I have given Majr. Moore an Order to receive it, and deliver it to your order. I am with great respect Sir Your most obedt. humble servt,
