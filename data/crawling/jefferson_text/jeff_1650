War Office [Richmond], 19 Dec. 1780. Capt. [Thomas] Quirk has applied to Muter to procure him a majors commission in Col. Clarkes [G. R. Clarks] regiment, but Capt. [John] Williams also claims this majority, and Muter encloses two certificates from Clark which may enable TJ to decide on Quirks claim. Quirk must leave soon, and Clarks being here will help settle the difficulty.
Reply appears at foot of Muters letter: In Council Dec. 23. 1780. We cannot decide between the opinions of Colo. Clarke and of the officers to whom it was referred without knowing the principles of the dispute. Th: Jefferson.
