[4 Mar. 1784]



The Committee appointed to revise the 4th. and 5th. of the instructions of Oct. 15. 1782 [1783] given to the Commissioners for negotiating a treaty with the Indians have agreed to the following resolutions.
Resolved that the said 4th. article be repealed and that instead thereof the following be substituted. 4thly. that a meridian line passing through the lowest point of the Rapids of Ohio to the [10] Northern boundary of these United states, shall be proposed as the1 line of division between the several Indian tribes2 and these states, so that all the lands comprehended between the said boundary on the North, the Ohio on the South, the said meridian on the West and Pennsylvania on the East, or so much thereof as the tribes, having title thereto, may be induced to part with, shall be ceded to the United states.3
Resolved that the said 5th. article be repealed and that instead thereof the following be substituted. 5thly. The interests and happiness of the Indians as well as of the inhabitants of the United states requiring that every circumstance should be avoided which may lead to hostile dispositions between them, and the meeting of several tribes4 in one council having a tendency to generate combinations for the purposes of war,5 the said Commissioners are instructed, as far as shall be in their power to treat with every tribe6 at different times and places; and where necessity shall oblige them to bring two or more tribes4 together, that they still keep their treaties and conferences distinct:7 that they make known to the Shawanese and Delawares that these United states consider them as independant nations and will protect them as such:8 that they countenance every disposition in any one of the six nations to treat and act separately and independantly of their confederacy:9 and that in general they discourage every coalition and consultation which might tend to involve10 any one tribe11 in the wars of the others.
