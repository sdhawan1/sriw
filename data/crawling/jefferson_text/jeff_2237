Charlottesville, 20 Feb. 1781. Since last writing to TJ, Clarke has received a letter from Brig. Gen. [James] Hamilton acquainting me that it was not agreeable to Maj. Gen. Phillips that the Convention Troops [665] should receive money for the Provisions due to them, and therefore he wishes that the Germans should receive the Provisions here and the British at Frederick Town.
