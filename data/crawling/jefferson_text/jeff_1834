Sir
Richmond Jan: 15th. 1781



As the dangers which threaten our Western frontiers the ensuing spring render it necessary that we should send thither Col. Crockets Battalion, at present on guard at Frederick Town, but raised for the Western service, I thought it necessary to give your Excellency previous information thereof that other forces may be provided in time to succeed to their duties. Cap. Reads troop of Horse if necessary, may be continued a while longer on guard.
I have the honor to be with the greatest respect Your Excellencys Most obedient & most hum. Servt.,

Th: Jefferson
