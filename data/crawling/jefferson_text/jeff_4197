[Paris, 20 May 1785. Entry in SJL reads: J. Holker. Receipt of his of Apr. 25. and of the copying press. Will send the 161 by Williamos or answer his order. Inclose the Acquit  caution (which la Motte had delivered me). Dr. Fs caisse not come. He writes to Mr. Holker. I sent by young Mr. Adams duplicates in Guillebaut v. Wharton. Not found.]
