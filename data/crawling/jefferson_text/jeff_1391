I send my Letter to the President of Congress under a flying Seal that you may peruse it. I beg that with all the Letters and papers, I now send your Excellency may be as soon as possible dispatched to Congress. I am Sir your obedient humble servant,

P.S. The inclosed Letter [from Lt. Co]lo. Washington, will acquaint you with all the Continental and Cavalry of your State we have to depend upon.
