Sir
Williamsburg. April 20th. 1781. 7 oClocke



Fourteen flatt bottomed Boats a ship two brigs two sloops and [505] one schooner heavily manned, have just arrived at Burwells Ferry. From every appearance I think they mean to land, as they have halted with a favorable Tide. I believe they wait for nothing but the arrival of two schooners which have their Cavalry on board. These vessells I am this moment informed have just turned Mullberry Island point. I moved out all the stores at this post last Evening.
I have the honor to be respectfully Yr Excellencys most obt Sevt,

Jas Innes Colo Com
