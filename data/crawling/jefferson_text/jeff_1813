Richmond Jany. 13. 1781.



As you have been very long appointed Cornet to a Troop of Dragoons, and have never repaired to duty; I am to desire that you will immediately assign to me the reasons which have kept you from duty. Should they not be satisfactory, a report of your conduct having been regularly made by Colo. Wood, an arrest must of course follow.

Th: J.
