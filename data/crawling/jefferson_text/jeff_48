Dear Sir
Lortons May 10. 1771



I omitted giving the Treasurer my Bond for things purchasd at the Palace Amount 8:18:6. Indeed it ought to have been Cash, but as I hope it will make little difference I shall take it as a favor if you would do it for me, and this shall indemnify you. I am Your hum Servt,

Thomas M. Randolph
