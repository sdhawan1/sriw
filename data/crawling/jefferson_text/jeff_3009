Sir
Gloucester May the 1st. 1781



I received your favor of the 12th. Ulto. requesting Cavalry to be raized to join Majr. Genl. Baron Steuben, and was anxious to have complyd therewith, but the Executive appearing to discourage my plan of raising and equiping a Troop of Horse, it has effectually prevented the Gentlemen from being equipd in any manner to answer the purpose for which they were calld. A few indeed have acted from necessity as light Horsemen, and have been for some weeks on duty endeavouring to put a stop to the daily ravages committed by the Enemy since the Arms have been taken from our Militia. I am with great respect your Excellencys Most Obt. Servt.,

J. Dixon
