Sir
Richmond Febry. 13th. 1781.



As I expect to see Majr. Forsythe here within a few Days I must beg leave to postpone a definitive answer to your Letter till I am informed whether he has any and what objections to your demand, after which I will do myself the pleasure of writing you on the Subject.

T.J.
