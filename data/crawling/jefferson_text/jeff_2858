Dear Sir



Salt River, 14 Apr. 1781. Encloses a copy of the proceedings of the commissioners to examine into the conduct of Capt. William Shannon, commissary in the western department. Having failed to prove the charges he made against Shannon, Slaughter hopes that no part of the information formerly given by me, will further injure him in your esteem.
