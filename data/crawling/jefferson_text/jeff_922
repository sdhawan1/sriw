In Council Feby. 4. 1780.



The Board are of Opinion that exorbitant as the Price is these Articles must be bought to complete the cloathing which will authorize us to march Bufords Battalion out of the State. A few days subsistence and pay (if detained for want of Shirts) will exceed the price demanded.

Th. Jefferson
