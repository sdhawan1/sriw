Sir
Charlottesville May 21st 1781



Should the Marquis Fayette give you Notice at any Time that there is Reason to apprehend the Enemy will cross James River, you will be pleased to order all Cattle and Horses which may be within twenty Miles wherever they shall at any Time be to be removed [&c. as in the Letter to Powhatan.]1 I am &c.,
 Thomas Jefferson
