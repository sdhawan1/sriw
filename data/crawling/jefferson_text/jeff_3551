[Annapolis, 22 Feb. 1784. Entry in SJL reads: Mr. Dulany to rent house. TJs letter to Dulany has not been found nor can Dulany be positively identified, though as a famous lawyer, a leading public figure in Maryland, and a friend of TJ (see De la Serre to TJ, 13 May 1786), Daniel Dulany may well have been the landlord involved. On 25 Feb. TJ wrote in his Account Book: Moved to Mr. Dulanys house. He continued to live there until he left Annapolis in May (Dumbauld, Jefferson, American Tourist, p. 567; Md. Hist. Mag., xli [1946], 199).]
