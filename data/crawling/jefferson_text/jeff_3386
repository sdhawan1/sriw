Gentlemen
In Council Octo: 30th. 1783.



The two last posts brought no letters from you which I am really sorry for as a full account of the proceedings of Congress on the place of their permanent residence was expected.
There are not yet a sufficient number of members to proceed to business.
I am &c.
