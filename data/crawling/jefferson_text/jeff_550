Be it enacted by the General Assembly, that the power of appointing days of public fasting and humiliation, or thanksgiving, throughout this commonwealth, may in the recess of the General Assembly, be exercised by the Governor, or Chief Magistrate, with the advice of the Council;1 and such appointment shall be notified to the public, by a proclamation,2 in which the occasion of the fasting or thanksgiving shall be particularly set forth. Every minister of the gospel3 shall on each day so to be appointed, attend and perform divine service and preach a sermon, or discourse, suited to the occasion, in his church, on pain of forfeiting fifty pounds4 for every failure, not having a reasonable excuse.5
