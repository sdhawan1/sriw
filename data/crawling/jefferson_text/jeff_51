Dear Sir
Albemarle June 30. 177[1].



The case of Plume v. Portlock now lies at the Rules in danger of a dismission for want of a declaration. Mr. Blair directed me to apply to you for instructions in this matter. Your favor herein will oblige Dr. Sir Your friend and servt.,

Th: Jefferson


P. S. On looking further into the Rule docket I find myself referred to you also for instructions to draw the bill in McVee v. Wilson. I have Wilsons bond to McVee.
