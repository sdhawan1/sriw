Richmond, 17 Aug. 1780. Acknowledges a letter to TJ (now absent) brought by Mr. Tate from Fredericksburg, 9 Aug. A warrant for 50,000 will be issued to Tate to enable him to confirm his contracts for meat for the Convention army. This is the last money that can be supplied for that army, at least until after the Assembly meets, because of the exhausting requisitions of the southern army.
