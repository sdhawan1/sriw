Sir
Washington June 4th. 1781



Okana-Stotes Baggage was first possessed by a detachment mostly Carolinians. The Medals, Belts of Wampum said to be of curious construction were secreted. Colo. Martin has lately purchased one of the Belts; curious enough, he says the wampum in it will answer the purposes at the Treaty (if any). A number of Papers, some curious and perhaps interesting were delivered to me, others I hear is since delivered into the Hands of the Commanding Officers of the Regiment from Carolinia. I will endeavour to collect the whole, and as soon as I can take copies of some that may be interesting to me, I will with pleasure send you the originals.
I am with great Respect your Obedient Servant,

Arthur Campbell
