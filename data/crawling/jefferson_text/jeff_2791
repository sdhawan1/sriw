Sir
Camp Everads Mill April 10th. 1781



I received a Letter some weeks ago from Col. Muter informing me the three state Regiments were to be reduced into one, and the oldest Officers to take command. If this arraingment takes place I am entitled to a Command in the said Regiment. I last winter got an order from the Baron for seven Months pay, which your Excellency informed me I was to Draw from the Continental Pay Master, before I saw him the Enemy came to Richmond and I lost the Order. I applyd to the Baron for another. He informd me he could not grant an order as he had received orders to the contrary but would give me an order for some money to carry me to Camp. I refused receiving such an order, and I hope your Excellency will Allow Major Long to receive my Pay due me from the 1st. of August last. I am obliged to be the expence of double my Pay should I be allowd the full depreciation. I am Sir Your Excelys. Most Obt. & Very Hum St.

Alexr. Dick.
