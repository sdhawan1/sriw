Gentlemen
Bath Hotel May 29. 1785. Westminster



Our Secretary of State for foreign affairs, in a Letter of 13. Ap. informs me, that he wrote Us a Letter by Capt. Lamb dated 11. March, inclosing a Variety of Papers respecting the Treaties we are directed to negotiate and conclude with the Barbary Powers.
Inclosed is a Copy of a Resolution of Congress of 14. February 1785, inclosed to me, in the Secretarys Letter. I know nothing of Capt. Lambs Arrival or of the Dispatches by him.
On the 26. I communicated to Lord Carmarthen my Credentials, and left him Copies, as we have done upon former occasions in France, and am to have my Audience of the King in his Closet as [171] the Secretary of State informs me, next Wednesday. I have the Honour to be, very respectfully, Gentlemen, your most obedient and most humble Servant,

John Adams
