[Annapolis, 14 Feb. 1784. Entry in SJL reads: Dr. Gilmer. Inclosed Foxs letter and resolution Congress. I shall be at Montill healthnews. TJs letter to Gilmer and its enclosures have not been found. Foxs letter was evidently one to TJ in reply to TJs missing letter to Fox of 31 Dec. 1783 concerning Gilmers accounts. On 22 June 1781 Gilmer had written to Theodorick Bland concerning his accounts (DLC: PCC, No. 78) and his letter was referred on 4 Apr. 1783 to a committee of three; this committee reported on 22 Apr. 1783 to the effect that the account of Dr. G. Gilmer for pay and rations be settled on the same [539] principles as the accounts of other hospital surgeons of the same rank, according to the time he shall appear to have been employed in the public service; and that the purveyor general return to Dr. George Gilmer a quantity of medicine equal to what he expended out of his private stores, for the use of the continental hospital under his care (JCC, xxiv, 229, 265). Edward Fox was commissioner for adjusting the accounts of the General Hospital; it is likely, therefore, that the resolution enclosed in TJs letter to Gilmer was a copy of the one just quoted.]
