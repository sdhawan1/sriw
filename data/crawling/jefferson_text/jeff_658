[Without place, after 22 July 1779.] Directed to the Governor and Council and written after the contract between the State of Virginia and Penet, Windel & Co. (q.v., 22 July) was signed. The writer considers the tenth and eleventh articles of the contract objectionable because they limit the exemption of arms makers from military service to twenty-one years and because the exemption applies only to imported laborersa restriction which will oblige the Undertakers to a perpetual importation of Artificers. He asks for amendment of these articles before the contract is submitted to the assembly for ratification.
