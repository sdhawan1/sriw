It is further enacted that the several Commissioners in each County shall before the Day to be appointed for the Assessors to enter on their Office, call together at some convenient place within their respective Counties the Several Assessors of the same who shall consult together and form some general mode which they shall pursue in Rating the several articles of Taxation.7 Provided always that there shall not be more than sixteen Assessors appointed in any one County.8 And be it further enacted that where a Recovery shall be had against any Sherif or Collector for failure in the payment of the Monies arising from the Rates or Taxes imposed by this or the above recited act, he shall be accountable in Damages at the Rate of Twenty Percentum Perannum for all Monies which he shall so fail to pay. And Whereas by the above Recited act the Treasurer is restrained from paying the Quota of this Commonwealth required by the general Congress till the Accounts of this State against the United States are settled which may be attended with bad consequences, Be it enacted that the said Treasurer is hereby empowered and required to pay the said full quota when it shall be demanded, any thing in the said Act to the Contrary notwithstanding.

And be it further enacted that no Person hereafter elected a Commissioner being a Member of either House of Assembly shall be subject to the Penalty imposed on those who refuse to act but the acceptance of the Office of a Commissioner shall vacate the Seat of any Person so accepting in either house of Assembly: [And Whereas by the said act intituled an act for raising a supply of money for Public exigencies it was enacted that the Commissioners for the several Counties after examining adjusting and certifying the Accounts of the Collection with their respective Sherifs and making the proper deductions for allowances to themselves the Clerks and the Assessors should enter the same in their Book and Transmit to the Treasurer a Copy of such entry and it may be necessary for the future information of the general Assembly that the said entries and copies thereof transmitted be made in a more special and distinct form that so the amount of the Assessment on the several species of Taxable property may be separately and distinctly known and also the amount of the additional Taxes paid by Nonjurors. Be it further enacted that the said entry and Copy transmitted shall in future during the continuance of the said Act be formed into Seven different Columns in one of which shall be stated the amount of the Assessment on landed property, in another that on Slaves, in another that on plate, in another that on Coin, in another that on Paper currency exclusive of loan office Certificates, in another that on Stocks, and in another that on the residuum of taxable Articles which sums Stated in the said Columns shall include a single Taxation only on Nonjurors, and that separate and a part from this shall be stated in like manner the amount of the additional Taxes paid by such Nonjurors; and at the foot of the whole shall be stated in separate articles also, the deductions for allowances to themselves, to the Clerks, and to the whole Assessors which Copy so made out they shall transmit immediately to the board of Auditors instead of that by the said act directed to be transmitted to the Treasurer for enabling them to call upon the Sherif for the ballance due and to state to the succeeding Assembly a General account in like distinct manner of the amount of the Assessment on the said Taxable Articles respectively in the several Counties.]9 Whereas by the Treaty of [221] Commerce entered into between his most Christian Majesty the King of France and the United States of America it is amongst other things stipulated that every commodity to be exported from any of the said States to the French West Indies Islands shall be free from any duty or impost. And Whereas by the before recited act a Tax or duty of Ten Shillings is laid on every hogshead of Tobacco to be exported from this Commonwealth Be it therefore enacted that all Tobacco cleared out at any of the naval offices of this Commonwealth to be exported to any of the West India Islands belonging to his Most Christian Majesty shall be and they are hereby exempted from any duty or Tax imposed thereon by the said Act any thing therein contained to the contrary thereof notwithstanding. And Whereas many good People of this Commonwealth who are well affected to the Cause of their Country were prevented taking the Oath of Allegiance by the Negligence of the Magistrates whereby they have been subjected to the Penalty of a double Tax as prescribed by an Act requiring all the Free Male Inhabitants of this State to give assurance of Fidelity and Allegiance to the same, Be it therefore enacted that all and every Person or Persons who hath or have been so subjected to the payment of a Double Rate or Tax as aforesaid by means aforesaid and shall make it appear to the Commissioners of their respective Counties that they have since taken the Oath Prescribed by Law, and that they now are and always have been true and faithful friends to the cause of liberty, and their Country shall be Reimbursed all such sums of Money by them paid over and above their just Tax and the same shall be deducted out of their Taxes for the Succeeding Year by the Collectors of their Respective Counties upon Certificate being had from the Commissioners of their said Counties for that purpose. And the said Commissioners are hereby directed to hold a Court or Courts for the purposes above mentioned and shall give notice of the same within their said Counties as often as they shall think fit and necessary so that the said Court or Courts are held between the time of Passing this Act and the first Day of [July next].3 And it is further enacted that so much of the aforesaid Recited act as comes within the purview and meaning of this Act be, and the same is hereby repealed.
