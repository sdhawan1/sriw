Jas. Innes Jas. Barron
In Council Apl. 7th. 1780.
This Schedule is calculated on a supposition that we have 6810 non commissioned Officers and Soldiers in fifteen Regiments in continental [....] We have in continental Service in all our Regiments of infantry and troops of cavalry (including the detachment under Colo: Porterfield) only 4175 non commissioned Officers and Soldiers: which it will be our duty to raise as soon as we can to 6070 that being our whole quota required by congress. To these must be added about 200 State Troops detained in the Eastern department and about 700 which we suppose will be acting on the Western and the Navy. We therefore recommend to the board of Trade to reduce by this Scale the Schedules, and then procure the articles enumerated, endeavouring to get first those which are most wanted.
