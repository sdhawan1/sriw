Sir
Richmond January the 25. 1781.



By the inclosed list it will appear what sum of money hath been issued and paid away of the last Emission, also the amount of balances due on several Warrants lodged in the Office and partly paid. Those two sums will exceed the sum I was empowered to Emit by the last Assembly. I have also sent you a list of Warrants in the hands of other People but I am well satisfied there are many more, as those I have mentioned are such as I coud recollect and in the [444] hands of persons in or near this place. I shall be obliged to you for your direction with respect to the balance of the money I was to emit and any others you may think necessary to give. Your Excellencys most obedient Servant,

George Brooke
