Annapolis, 5 Jan. 1781. Joseph Shoemaker, said to be a subject of Virginia and a former resident of Yorktown, was taken in Chesapeake Bay; he has a captains commission from the enemy and is confined in the Baltimore co. jail as a prisoner of war. If upon inquiry it is thought proper to claim him as a subject of Virginia, he will be delivered under guard to Alexandria and delivered to any person directed to receive him. In the meantime he will remain in custody.
