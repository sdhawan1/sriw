Sir
Havre 16 April 1785



Your much Esteemd favour of 10th. Curt. came duly to hand; an Absence of 2 days at Honfleur occasionned my delay in replying by Return of Poste.
We have at present no Ship bound to Virginia in the Port, but most likely in next month, there may be; two are allready Saild in last Month. As soon as one offers I shall take pleasure in informing you thereof, and be happy to be usefull to you, or any friend you may recommend. Theres little doubt, but what between this and the End of May an occasion will offer here for your friend to proceed to Virginia.
As You have not given me your Directions I adress the present to You at the incomparable Doctor Franklins in order to ensure its coming to hand.
I remain very respectfully Your most humble & obedt. Servt.,

Js. Carmichael
