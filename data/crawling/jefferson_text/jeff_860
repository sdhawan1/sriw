Williamsburg, 16 Dec. 1779. There are three captains, two lieutenants and four cornets in Maj. Nelsons corps. Two gentlemen are appointed to recruit the quotas of a lieutenant. If they have not done so, they do not belong to the corps of horse, and the officers who have raised their quotas and are now on duty should be the officers of the three troops of horse and should rise according to seniority. Signed by Nelson, Barron, and Lyne.
