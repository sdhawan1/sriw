Without place, 26 Apr. 1781. After the Fatted Beefs are Consumd a Call may take Place to Collect Bacon. If this happens, Woodson [562] desires to be excused from that duty, as many Publick Stores are Stationd with me, and the absolute Necessity of Being at home as a publican &c. Eight to nine thousand bushels of wheat for flour will be collected in this county.
