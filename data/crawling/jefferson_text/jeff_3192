Philadelphia 15. June 1781



Before this comes to Hand your Excellency will have received my Letter of the 2d Instant with its Enclosures, by which you will be informed that a Negotiation for Peace between the Belligerent Powers may probably take Place through the Mediation of the Empress of Russia and Emperor of Germany.
In Consequence of which Congress have thought proper to add four other Plenipotentiaries to the Honorable John Adams Esquire to assist in the expected Negotiation, of which you are elected one, as you will be informed by the enclosed Resolve. You will doubtless [95] come this Way to embark, if Circumstances will admit of your Undertaking this important Service. The Commissions will be prepared immediately, as no Time should be lost.
Your Appointment is ordered to be kept secret that the Enemy may not get Intelligence of your Embarkation.
With very great Respect I have the Honor to be Your Excellencys Most obedient & most humble Servant,

Sam. Huntington President
