[2 September 1776]



In Silver. Given the quantity of Standd [Standard] metal, say As 40 : 37 :: qty. Standd metal: qty. of pure silver, or X by .925.
In Gold. Given the quantity of Standd metal, deduct 1/12 it leaves the qty. of fine gold.
To make a dollar 6/. silver of that alloy must be 4d 20/139 the pennyweight. I.e. pure silver must be* 4d 7404/15429 the dwt.
By Virga. laws 24 grs standard gold = 22 grs pure gold was worth 60d. Therefore 24 grs pure gold was worth 65d 5/11. 24 grs standard silver = 22.2 grs pure silver was worth 4d. Therefore 24 grs pure silver was worth 4d 12/37. Therefore the value of pure gold to pure silver was as 15 3/22 : 1.
The English pound Troy contains 12oz.; each ounce 20 dwt.; each dwt. 24 grains; each grain 20 mites.
The English Standard for gold is 22. carats of fine gold + 2. carats alloy. I.e. 1/12 alloy of silver and copper in equal parts. for silver coin 11oz. 2.dw fine silver + 18.dw. alloy in the pound. I.e. 3/40 or .075 alloy of fine copper.
