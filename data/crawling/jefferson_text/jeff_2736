Porterfields death happened after the Resolution of Assembly directing the state Regiments to be reformed, no promotion on that event can be admitted: That the Executive approves of the 2d. Lieutenants, supernumeries, acting as Ensigns: That it is Mr. Brownes duty to furnish provisions whenever necessary: And that they have sent a Warrant for the money desired for Capt. Pryor.
