5. How many tents, or tent-cloth & other camp necessaries have we?
We had 230 tents in November last. They were delivered for the use of the militia & state troops during that invasion. After the invasion 75 were sent on with Cob. Greens corps; some were reserved for the troops at Chesterfd. C. H. and the rest are in use with the state troops & militia now in the feud in this state. We have not at present a sufficient number of camp-kettles, but very shortly shall have. We were disfurnished of our canteens by the militia which went to the Southward, and now have very few.


6. What prospect have we of supplies of the above? Also blankets & cloth for Souldiers clothes?
We have no prospect of any supply of tent cloth. Campkettles we have it in our power to procure from Hunters works. There are provided for the men at Chesterfeild C. house 400 suits of clothes, 400 pr. stockings, 200 pr. shoes, 800 shirts, & 200 blankets. The deficiency we have no means of providing, nor yet a single article for Colo. Bufords corps. Colo. Taylors regiment is unclothed and no prospect of our cloathing them. Our Captives in Charlestown are in extreme distress, which nothing will enable us to relieve unless we could get permission to send tobacco to them.

8. What stock of provision. What are our resources, & expectations as to them.
I hope we shall be able to purchase about 3000 hogs. The act of assembly will furnish 3000 beeves. We have engaged 10,000 barrels of flour &can engage more if necessary. The returns of short forage under the specific tax the last year amounted to about 100,000 bushels, and I suppose may be reckoned the same this year. Whatever more may be wanting, can be procured under the provision law. We shall be [473] very far short of the Continental demand in spirits & salt. The pork, beef, & flour abovementioned excludes what we are now consuming.


How far are you advised as to the wants of N. Carolina?
I have not the least information.
