London 10th Decemr. 1784



On the 17th. Septr: I did myself the Honour to write to your Excellency at Paris, in which I took the Liberty of Inclosing your Account Currt. Leaving Ballance in my favour 122.5.10 made out to the 22d. Augst:, and as I have not since been favourd with an Answer Mr. Moore who I yesterday saw and who particularly request his Duty to you, was certain that my Adress had not come to hand, and therefore desired I would inform you thereof, which I hope from the Liberty now taken you will not be displeasd. Several Vessells are just come in from Virginia but nothing particularly New. am Your Excellencys Most obliged Hble. Servt.,
