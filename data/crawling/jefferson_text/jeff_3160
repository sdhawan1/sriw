Sir
Winchester June 1st. 1781.



I wrote you the Sixteenth and Twenty sixth of May, and mentioned in both letters, that a board of Officers had sat and were of opinion that most of the soldiers of the Regiment of Guards were [67] entitled to discharges. There are only one Corporal and four privates left, a Fifer having received his discharge on the opinion of a Court martial since, and a soldier for being in an ill state of health.
In each of those letters were inclosed a Return of the Regiment, and I hoped to have been favoured with an answer by this time and orders to discharge the Officers and Soldiers left; who can be of but little service, as they are so few, and I did not think myself authorised to discharge them without your orders. The Officers are very desirous to go home, having no expectation to be continued in service. I beg that a messenger may be sent to inform me what to do. I am Sir, with great respect Your most obedt. humble servant,

Fra Taylor
