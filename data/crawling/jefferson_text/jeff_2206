Richmond, 17 Feb. 1781.. This letter is identical in substance with that sent by TJ to Huntington this day, q.v., except that the last sentence in the first paragraph and the last two sentences in the paragraph before the complimentary close in the letter to Huntington are not in the letter to Washington.
