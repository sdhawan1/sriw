Sir
In Council Jan. 22. 1781.



I do myself the pleasure of inclosing you a Brigadier Generals commission. The laws having given us power to appoint a General officer only for special purposes, and not a perpetual one, has obliged us to express the particular occasion of this appointment. Besides this I thought it necessary to give you an exemplification of your former commission which was perpetual.
I wish you in every circumstance all possible success and felicity, and to beleive me to be with very sincere esteem Sir your most obedt. & most humble servt.,

Th: Jefferson
