Sir
Richmond aug. 14. 1780



If you will be pleased to transmit me an account of the medicines furnished from the stores under your direction to the Fendant, while at York, with an acknowledgment thereon of satisfaction received from this state, I will see that you have credit for the same in your account with us. We wish this to be done, in order to put it in our power by paying off this account to idemnify them for an [547] improper article of debit, which having been entered and paid before it came to our notice, we have no other means left of correcting. I am sir with great esteem, Your most obedient servt.,

Th: Jefferson
