Sir
In Council March 22d. 1781



The Board approve of your having complied with the Call for militia on the Invasion of our Country, tho that Call did not proceed immediately from the Executive.
Necessity obliged us on the first of Arnolds1 (&c. as in the Letter to the County Lieutenant of Culpeper).
