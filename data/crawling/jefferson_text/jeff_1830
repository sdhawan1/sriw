Sir
Richmond Jany. 15. 1781.



As considerable numbers of militia are daily arriving at this place, very many of whom are not armed, and as I know of no public stores from whence they can be supplied, I beg to know your Excellencys sentiments with respect to the propriety of discharging such as cannot be equipped, or whether it would be your wish that they should be detained here, till a sufficient number of arms can be repaired to put into their hands.
I have the honor to be, Sir, your Excellencys very obedt servt,

William Davies
