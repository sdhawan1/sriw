Sir

It being necessary to collect at Hoods as large a number of boats as possible to transport men and horses across the river as occasion may require, you are hereby authorized to impress all the boats on this and Chickahominy river except only one to be left at each ferry and except also such boats as from particular circumstances of which you are to Judge in your discretion it woud be attended with very peculiar distress to take. Care shoud be taken to distinguish every mans boat oars &c. and when no longer wanted for the public you will see that they be returned, taking receipts for them. I am, sir, Your very humble servant,

T.J.
