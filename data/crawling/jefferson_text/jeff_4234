Your Committee are of Opinion that the Annual Products of this State will in a very few Years, be as great as Ever, and that the Article of Tobacco in particular will farr Exceed the Quantity ever made.
By the prohibition lately laid on our Rice to Portugal, and the British proclamation preventing the Transportation of our produce to their Islands (Except in British Bottoms) as well as the opening many Markets for our produce, which were heretofore Restrained Your Committee are of Opinion that the Exports of this Country may Vary, and that they probably will be Shipped to the Several Ports, and in the following Proportions


130,000

40,000 Tierces to Great Britain


20,000 To Different Ports in France Spain & the Meditera[nean]

Corn, Peas, Beef and Pork, as well as Lumber of all Sorts (Except a Small part of the Staves) were chiefly Shipped to the West Indies, which is now prohibited to the British Islands, Except in British Bottomsvery Little of said Articles being Shipped to the other Islands, or at most not above one fifth Part of the Lumber.
The Returns generally made for the Exports from this State are as follows


Dry Goods from Europe


Wines from France, Spain and Portugal


Negroes from the Coast of Africa


Rum, Sugar

From the West Indies


Molasses and Coffee


But your Committee are of opinion that the Exports of this State, will be regulated by the Imports from Each Country.
The Freights from this Port are as follows
To Great Britain for Rice and Naval Stores 50/ to 60/  Ton
Holland and other European Ports for Ditto 55/ to 65/  Ton
To all European ports for Indico, half penny to ths  pound


Do.
Do. for Tobacco, 30/ to 35/  Hhd.


Do.
Do. for Deer Skins 25/ to 30/  Do.



for Ditto in the Hair ths. to 1d.  pound


Your Committee observe that as they are unacquainted with the Burthens, which may be Imposed on our Trade by Foreign Powers, They Cannot point out their Remedies. Yet they must Report that the prohibitions laid [on] our Rice to Portugal, and being restrained from Shipping in our own Bottoms to the British West Indies, are the Greatest Disadvantages, and Burthens, under which our Trade at present Labours.
