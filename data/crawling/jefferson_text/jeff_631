In council July 1. 1779.



If the board of trade will be pleased to resolve on the quantity of tobacco they think necessary to be purchased I will submit their resolution to the council, and make no doubt they will approve of it, as it seems to be their disposition to leave the board of trade very much to their own discretion.
