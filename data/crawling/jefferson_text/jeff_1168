Without place, 11 July 1780. Acknowledges a letter from Jefferson which has given me the greatest pleasure I have felt since my entrance into public life. Hopes to continue to be of service in his new post on the Court of Appeals: if I can preserve the friendship of a Jefferson and a very few others, I shall think myself perfectly happy and safe.
