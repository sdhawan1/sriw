South Quay, 25 Feb. 1781. Agreeable to the within information, Calvert has seized the trunk and has found no letters in it, but rather a quantity of valuable dry Goods; wishes to know what is to be done with them. By law the Naval Office is open from ten to three; this prevents Calvert from attending muster; and, on account of his feet, he believes himself entitled to exemption from bearing arms. Desires orders to Exemt me from Mustering or allow me to shut the office on Muster days; also wishes to know any further duties of his post laid on by the last Assembly. The following memorandum appears at the foot of the text: Mar. 21. 1781. The Attorney general will be pleased to advise what should be done with the goods above mentioned, and what with the person of the offender. Th: Jefferson.
