Sir
In Council March 6th. 1781



I inclose you a Letter from Colo. Waggoner and Depositions on the Subject of Mattenlys Complaint on which I had written to him: They appear to justify his Conduct. The Tobacco note which Mattenly supposes should have been given him has been returned by Colo. Waggoner to the Auditors. I am, &c.,

T. J.
