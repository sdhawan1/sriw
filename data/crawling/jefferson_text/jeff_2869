Lancaster County, 15 Apr. 1781. Encloses a list of the number of Men raised in this County for recruiting this States quota of Troops to serve in the Continental Army, likewise a particular number of each Division, and a return of the Militia but not so full as your last instructions required, as I have not recieved any returns from the Different Captains since. The return of ammunition will show the great need of that article in a region Constantly exposed to invasion.
