Sir
In Council March 5th. 1781



Baron Steuben has sent to this Place a number of the Levies raised under the act of assembly passed at the Session of May 1780, [62] whom he declines retaining as unfit for Service. It was his Desire that it should be made known to the assembly. I therefore take the Liberty of inclosing to you his Letter. The Discharge of these men will on the one Hand lose the Bounty the public: on the other the retaining them brings on the additional loss of pay, Clothing, and Subsistence: unless it should be disapproved by the assembly, we shall direct them to be immediately discharged. I have the honor, &c,

T. J.
