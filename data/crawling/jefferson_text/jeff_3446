Th: Jefferson to Messrs. Gherry & Mc Henry
[21? December 1783]



I send you the sketch, which I have been obliged to obliterate and blot after making what I intended for a fair copy. You will observe my plan was to make a short review in very general terms of those actions which redound to the Generals particular credit, viz. the discouraging circumstances under which he accepted the commandhis steadiness and perservance when obliged to retire across the Delaware and our affairs then at their lowest point of [411] depressionhis revival of our hopes by recrossing the Delawareand finally the capture of Cornwallis which undoubtedly made the peace. I have noted these events in the margin opposite to the passages alluding to them, and have drawn lines under other expressions taken from the Generals address. Perhaps this answer is too short; perhaps it is too warm. A want of time must apologize for the one, and an exalted esteem for the other faults. Be so good as to handle it roughly and freely and make it what it should be.
