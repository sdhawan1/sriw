[Place unknown, before 9 June 1781. Extract of a letter from Josiah Parker to the Speaker of the House of Delegates, Carters Meades Mills, 9 June 1781 (Vi): A few days since I wrote Mr. Jefferson respecting my peculiar situation being in the field with a few men from Isle of Wight and Nancemond and from a request of the Marquiss de la Fayette to embody as many of the Militia as I could down James River below the Enemy, in consequence of which in addition to the men before mentioned [I] have ordered from Southampton 200 and from Surry 100 Men. The last County has nearly sent their number but the former contrary to their common custom has only furnished a small proportion.  I have employed Smiths to repair the Arms, to make horsemans Swords and Mechanicks of different sorts in the different branches without sufficient authority, which may probably ruin me without even [84] the approbation of my Country, and for what? To expose my person, my property, my family and all, tis a horrid Situation and altho I have wrote the Governor on the Subject, he treats it with contempt, and does not deign to answer me. I fear my Dear Sir the root of Springs of Government is rotten, and I dread the Consequence. Nothing but my zeal coud induce me to write thus freely. I am foolishly proud of my Country, and cannot bear to see her neglected. Parkers letter to TJ has not been found; it is possible that it was not received.]
