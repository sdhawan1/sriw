[Richmond, 10 Oct. 1780. JCC, xviii, 9578 (21 Oct.): A letter, of 10, from Governor Jefferson was read; Whereupon, Resolved, That the reasons assigned by his excellency Governor Jefferson for inviting Oconostota and a few other principal warriors of the Cherokee nation to visit Congress and the Commander in Chief and army are wise and prudent, and that Governor Jeffersons letter with the papers enclosed, be referred to the Board of War, who are directed to take order for the accommodation of the said chiefs on their arrival. TJs letter has not been found, though a copy of Congress resolve approving the visit was enclosed in Huntingtons reply of 21 Oct., q.v. The visit itself never took place, for the reasons given in TJs letter to Huntington, 17 Feb. 1781.]
