Sir
New-York, August 23, 1774.



As the Collection, mentioned in the Proposals annexed, is a Matter of Importance to the Colonies in general, and may answer valuable Purposes, I flatter myself you will think it not unworthy of your Patronage;-and therefore take the Liberty of soliciting your kind Assistance by favouring me with the Use of such suitable Papers, relating to your Colony, as it may be convenient for you to procure.
Sir, Your most obedient, And very humble Servant,

Eben. Hazard


When the Conduct of Individuals in a Community is such as to attract public Attention, others are very naturally led to many Inquiries about them; so when civil States rise into Importance, even their earliest History becomes the object of Speculation. From a Principle of Curiosity, many who have but little, or no Connection with the British Colonies in America, are now prying into the Story of their rise and progress, while others wish for a farther Acquaintance with them, from better, though perhaps more interested Motives. The Means of obtaining this Information are not accessible by every Person, and if they were, are so scattered, that more Time would be necessary for collecting them, than would be requisite for reading them after they were collected.
To remove this Obstruction from the path of Science, and at the same Time to lay the Foundation of a good American History, by preserving from oblivion valuable Materials for that Purpose,
it is proposed
To form a complete Collection of what may be with Propriety stiled,
American State Papers.
This Collection will begin with the Grant from Henry 7th, to John Cabot, and his Sons for making Discoveries; and will include every important public Paper (such as Royal Grants, Charters, Acts of Parliament, &c. &c.) relating to America, of which either the original, or [145] authentic Copies can be procured, down to the present Time. The History of the STAMP-ACT, and other Acts of the British Parliament for raising a Revenue among us by internal Taxation;-Resolves of the American Assemblies;-Votes of Town Meetings;and such political Pamphlets and other fugitive Pieces as are properly connected with the general Design, and are worthy of Preservation, will also be included; and to the Whole will be added an Introduction, containing an Account of the Constitution of the different British American Colonies, and a very copious Index.
It is supposed that the Whole may be comprised in five Volumes Octavo, and that the Price of each Volume, well bound and lettered, will not exceed One Dollar and an Half.
The Compilation is already begun, and shall be sent to the Press as soon as it can be got ready, and a sufficient Number of Subscribers can be procured. Every Person must see that this Undertaking is attended with many and great Difficulties; and that the Compiler needs, what the Work if well executed will merit, the friendly Assistance of others. He therefore solicits the public Patronage; and as the Work will not only serve to gratify the Curiosity of the inquisitive, but be eminently useful in much more important Points of View, he begs that Gentlemen who are possessed of proper Materials for the Purpose, will be kind enough to favour him with the Use of them, and they shall be carefully returned.They will be safely forwarded to him, if deposited in the Hands of either of the following Gentlemen, who will also take in Subscriptions, viz.
