Dear Sir
Wmsburg Janry. 15. 1781



Since my last, informing you that the Enemys Fleet had passed Burwells Ferry, it has only fallen down the River as low as Hardys Ferry. They land on the South Side wherever they have a Prospect of getting any valuable Plunder. I am concerned to hear of the bad Conduct of the Men commanded by Capt. Hockaday, and shall, as soon as they join me again, make the strictest Enquiry into it. I am, Dear Sir, with great Respect, Your mo: Obedt. Servt.,

Thos Nelson Jr. B.G.
