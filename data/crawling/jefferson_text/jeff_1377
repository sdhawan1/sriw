Sir
War Office Richmond Octobr 1st. 1780.



You will please to take measures, for immediately establishing an Express at Hampton, one at Williamsburg, and keeping an Express house at York. An Express will be sent from hence to remain at N: Kent Ct. house. Circumstances render it most essentially necessary, that this measure shoud be at present taken, that the quickest intelligence may be conveyed from Hampton to this place, shoud there be occasion for it. I must therefore beg for your exertions.
The stove at the House of Burgesses in Williamsburg will be wanted for the House of Delegates. It is his Excellencys wish, that you woud send it up by the first convenient opportunity. I am yours,

Geo: Muter C.
