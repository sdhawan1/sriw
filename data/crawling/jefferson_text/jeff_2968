Dear Colo.
Petersburg. 23 April. 12 oClock



As I am unacquainted with officers commanding the Militia at Richmond, and it being my desire that of those that are Armed one [545] half shall march immediately to Turkey Island and the other to the Long bridge on Chickahominy, I have inclosed the order, which I request you to communicate.
I only wait the arival of Colo. Senf, to visit hoods and Blands Ordinary, where I intend making the Disposition, to oppose the Enemy Should [he] come this side the River.
I am Dear Colo. [with] much esteem your most Obed humble Servt,

Steuben Maj: Genl:
