Sir
Monticello Sep. 30. 1782.



The unhappy circumstances which have abstracted me from all business during the preceding summer will I hope apologize for [198] my being so late in acknowleging the receipt of your letter of June 8. on the subject of the papers in the case of Kennons trustees. I have copies [of the] Bill, Mr. Kennons answer, Mr. Wayles and Hardymans joint answer, the separate answer of Acrill, the joint one of Baker & Thompson, list of the suits wherein Mr. Wayles and Hardyman were bail and the decree. But these are all of them copies, and so attested by Mr. Davenport. If I ever saw the original papers, be assured that they did not remain in my possession, as I never trusted myself with the custody of such papers. I kn[ow tha]t I have seen the original instrument of exoneration sig[ned by] the creditors, but I have no copy of that. I am Sir Your very humble servt,

Th: Jefferson

P.S. On recurring to another bundle of papers I find an attested copy of the instrument of exonerat[ion.]
