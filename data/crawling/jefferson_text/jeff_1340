Sir
Richd. Sepr. 13th 1780



Colo. Finnie being about to send some provision vessels to the head of Elk, I have desired him to order one into Baltimore, to the master of which I shall be obliged to you to have delivered what ever cartouch boxes you have in readiness for us as we are in immediate want of them.
I am sir, Your very humble servant,

Th: Jefferson
