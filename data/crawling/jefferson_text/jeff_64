Gent.
Williamsburgh June 11. 1772.



I have just received notice from Mr. Wythe that in the case of Jamieson and Taylor v. Meredith and others he will move at the next court to have the effects delivered into the plaintiffs hands. I have not yet had time to enquire whether such steps have been yet taken as will entitle him to do this. However it is better that your correspondents prevent it which cannot be done with certainty but by their sending in their answers in proper form before the next court. I am this moment leaving town having just taken time to inform you of this measure & am Gent Your very humble servt.,

Th: Jefferson


P.S. Be pleased to send your own answers immediately to Mr. Everard inclosed.
