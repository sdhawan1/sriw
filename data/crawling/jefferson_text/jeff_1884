Sir
Richmond Jany. 19. 1781.



The militia from the counties your Excellency mentions have all arrived. Those from Amherst, who came in the last, marched today.
[407]
All the military stores, I have directed to be issued since my arrival at this place, have been issued by Captain Spiller and Captain Irish. A number were previously delivered by a Waggon master Patten at Manikin town and Judes ferry. He lives at Petersburg. I shall make every enquiry within my power, and shall chearfully give every information I can, towards the recovery of the public arms and accoutrements.
I have the honor to be, sir, your Excellencys most obedt hble servt.,

William Davies


P.S. As I shall leave town tomorrow, I beg to mention that a number of valuable books are lying open in the Senate house and may be carried off by any body that chuses. Major Claiborne has a few of them.
