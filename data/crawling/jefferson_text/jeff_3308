[Philadelphia, without date, taken down in Jan. 1783.] Several series of notes, the order of which is not determinable, from papers principally in the office of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs.

These were taken by TJ from the Secret Journal of Foreign Affairs kept separately by Secretary Thomson from the Rough Journal of the proceedings of Congress.
