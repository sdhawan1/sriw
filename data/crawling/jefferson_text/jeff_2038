Osbornes, 5 Feb. 1781. Agreeable to TJs instructions Lewis has made Every Captain Acquainted what they have to do. There are now two vessels here that could take in military stores, and if required at Richmond they will be ordered up. Since contrary winds may keep Lewis and his force from getting to Hoods as soon as expected, provisions will be needed.
