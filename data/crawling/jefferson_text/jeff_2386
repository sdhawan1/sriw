Sir
Chesterfield Co. Ho. 5 Mar [1781]



The General has set out this morning for Williamsburgh. He desired me to write your Excellency acquainting you that he had received a Letter from Capt. Eddins, the commanding Officer of artillery at York, Mentioning the great want of powder, there not being more than one Barrell and a half at the post.
It is the Barons wish that your Excellency will take measures to have some powder sent there, likewise a quantity put on board a Vessell and sent to College Creek as soon as possible. I have the honor
