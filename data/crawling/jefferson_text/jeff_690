West Point August the 26th 1779



Your Excellency I make no doubt has been made fully acquainted with the Ordinance established by Congress by their Act of the 23d [77] of March for regulating the Cloathing department, and recommending the Respective States to appoint State or Sub Cloathiers. I addressed the Other States on this subject on the 22d of May, but deemed the measure unnecessary with respect to Virginia, as a Gentleman had been already appointed to act as such.
I have filled up Two of the Commissions transmitted by Your Excellency for John Allison, Gentn. as Lieutenant Colonel of the 1st State Regiment to rank as such from 1 Jany. 1779 vice Brent promoted and for Thos. Meriwether as Major of the same to rank from same date vice Allison promoted.
