Sir
Charlottesville May 21st 1781



Whenever the Honble. Major Genl. Marquis La Fayette shall think it necessary and shall so inform you, you will be pleased to have collected all the Boats and other smaller vessels, whether Public or Private, on Pamunkey either on or opposite to the Shore of your County and to have them carried to such Places as he shall direct. I am &c.,

Tho Jefferson
