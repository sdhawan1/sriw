Sir
In Council March 20th. 1781



The Superintendance of the lead mines having been formerly in the Board of Trade devolves of Course on yourself as succeeding to their Duties.
I mention this matter now particularly because our Stock of Lead being very low and the Demand great we wished the mines to be worked to their greatest extent. I must therefore beg the favor [192] of you to endeavour to engage as many Hands immediately as may be employed to advantage in order to push this most essential Work. I am &c.,

T. J.
