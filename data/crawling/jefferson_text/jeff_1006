Williamsburg 28. Mar. 1780.



The Expence to this State in particular which is occasioned by every days detention of these troops, and the Danger impending over Charles Town renders it expedient for the public Good to approve of the above contract however exorbitant the price. I do therefore approve of it.

Th. Jefferson
