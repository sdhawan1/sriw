Britain, that I will not put in prac[tice] a[ny] means for obtaining intelligence as to the force, finances, posts, harbours, naviga[tion] or other circumstances of the state of Virga. or of any other of the United states of Ame[rica,] that I will not carry on nor treat on the subject of carrying on any commerce with any citize[n of] the said United states nor buy nor sell any thing to or from any of them further than is necessary for my perso[nal] subsistence or accomodation while among them nor otherwise say or do any thing to the prejudice of any of the said states and this [pa]role shall be binding on me so long as I remain within the state of Virga.
