Sir
In Council Febry. 27. 1781.



I will notify to the Baron the necessity for the attendance of Genl. Nelson and your Self on the Legislature that he may take order in it. In the mean time I should hope the commands may be safely devolved on those next in rank.
I hope my last letter to you has made effectual provision against the disaffection of Militia.
I am &c. &c.,

T. J.
