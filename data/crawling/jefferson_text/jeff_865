[Williamsburg]  18 Dec. 1779. The public shipyard at Cumberland should be discontinued because of the enormous cost of maintenance. The trading department has only six vessels, and there is little prospect of increasing the number. These can be kept in repair at less expense than the present cost of the public yard.
