In Council Dec. 18th. 1779.



Cap. De Klauman having sometime ago explicitly in the presence of the Board made his election to withdraw from duty in the Regiment [230] of Artillery, and relied on his appointment to a majority in one of the Eastern Batalions and the vacancy thereby occasioned having been supplied by a new appointment, they are of opinion he cannot resume his command in that Regiment: the proposition to promote Cap. De Klauman to the Majority in the State Garrison Regiment renders necessary the determination of a previous general question whether established usage authorises the transferring a senior captain from one Regiment to the majority of another in preference to a junior captain of that other; or whether promotions are confined to the Regimental line only: reserving for future determination the question whether Cap. de Klauman is still entitled to the benefit of the Date of his former commission; The Board of war will be pleased to favour the council with their opinions on these points.
