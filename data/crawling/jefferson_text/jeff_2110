Sir
Richmond Feb. 11. 1781.



Having been informed about a week ago that the troops nearest to the enemys lines were much in want of ammunition waggons I have had two made ready, which are now sent to your orders. I think it was Genl. Lawson particularly who applied for these waggons.
I have the honour to be with much esteem & respect Sir Your most obedt. humble servt.,

Th: Jefferson
