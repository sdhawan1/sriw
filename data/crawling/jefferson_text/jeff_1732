Sir
January 2d 1781



The arrival of a Hostile Army here being confirmed and there being Reason to believe they mean immediately to push into the Heart of the Country, you will be pleased in the instant of receiving this to put your Troops in motion for Petersburg leaving Orders for the Cloathing which will come to Brunswick to follow you.
I am Sir Your very humble Servant,

T.J.
