Sir
Richmond Apr. 16. 1781.



Being informed you have a much larger supply of oil than will shortly be necessary for your works and the Continent being distressed at their tannery here for that article, be so good as to lend Majr. Claiborne so much as he may want and you can spare, which he will replace. I am Sir Your very humble servt.,

Th: Jefferson
