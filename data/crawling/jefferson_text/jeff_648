Board of Trade July 17th. 1779.



Messrs. McCallum Osborne & Co. have made an offer of a new Brig just Launched of the undermentioned Dementions, her Sails Rigging &c. fitted and may be ready in three weeks the price [38] 30,000. We employed Capt. Maxwell, in whose Judgment we think we can confide, to go up and examine her; he Reports that it is his opinion she is a good Vessel and will sail fast. We are of opinion the said Vessel should be purchased, as the State will be under the necessity of having such and it is also our opinion that such a Vessel could not be built and got ready in this time of general scarcity for many Months and probably when built at much greater Expence.
