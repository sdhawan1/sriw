Cumberland County, 16 Apr. 1781. Skipwiths neighbor, John Chapman of Amelia co., proposes to undertake the business of repairing public arms. Skipwith can recommend him as an honest independent Freeholder and an uncommon mechanical genius, fully equal to the task of either repairing or making Guns; he will, moreover, perform his duties with strict fidelity.
