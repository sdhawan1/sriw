Sir
Charles City Feby. 3d-81.



I receivd your Summons by Express, and shall pay due attention thereto, as soon as my little domestic affairs are brought into [523] order1 again. After a long application to business in the Assembly its reasonable to suppose I wishd to have enjoyd a few weeks at home; but one day did not pass before we were invaded, and all who livd near the River were obliged to retire to a more secure situation with their Families in order to render more Service when occasion required than could have been done otherwise. I hope therefore, that although my neglect of Duty is not justifiable, my peculiar situation will at least be an excuse for it.
In ten or twelve days I expect to be in Richmond, unless your Excellency may think fit to demand my Attendance sooner. I am with the highest regard your Excellencys Most obedient Servant,

John Tyler
