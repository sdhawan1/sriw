Sir
 Williamsburgh Feby 24th 1781.



The Return you require was sent from this post to the adjutant General, above nine Days since. But that I suppose having miscarried from the villainy of the Express riders (every one of whom, that I am acquainted with ought to suffer Death) I herewith transmit a second Account of the two Regiments stationed at and below this place. I can with truth assure your Excellency that I never within the Compass of my short existence experienced so much real anxiety as has fallen to my lot for a few Days past, on account of the mutinous spirit that prevails among the militias on Service in this Quarter. The promise of reliefs has appeased them for a time and I hope they will remain quiet until actual reliefs do arrive.
General Nelson desires me to remind your Excellency that in a few Days legislative Duty will call us from our Commands. He requests that you would inform the Baron of this Circumstance [700] that officers may be timously sent down to supply our places. I have the honor to be most respectfully Yr Excellencys most obt Servt,

Jas Innes Colo Commt.
