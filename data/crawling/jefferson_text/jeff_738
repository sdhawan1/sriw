[Before 23 October 1779]



In the act establishing the board of Auditors the words are that they are authorised and required to give warrants on the Treasurer for the payment or advance of wages to our delegates in Congress, debiting each delegate &c. The Auditors then and not the Governour are to give the warrant, as they will see on turning to the act.

Th: J.
