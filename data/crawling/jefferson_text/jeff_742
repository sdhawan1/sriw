Sir
In Council Oct. 25. 1779



When you wrote your letter of the 13th. inst. my last to you was on the road. I now send you one Captains and three Ensigns commissions, so they will stand thus.


Burnley

Captains
Slaughter

Lieutenants


Purvis
Taylor


Porter
Paulett


Burton
Pettus


White
Winston

Ensigns.


Herndon
Slaughter





Paulet


I am sorry to tell you that the throng of business peculiarly incumbent on the council puts it out of their power to do any thing with your requisition for necessaries more than to put it into the hands of the board of war. That board has not set these six weeks; but we are told they will set today and I hope will expedite your requisitions as well of the former as present letter.
I am Sir Your very humble servt,

Th: Jefferson
