BE IT ENACTED by the General Assembly that it shall and may be lawful for the delegates of this State to the Congress of the United States or such of them as shall be assembled in Congress and the said delegates or such of them so assembled are hereby fully authorized and empowered for and on behalf of this State by proper deeds or Instrument in writing under their Hands and Seals to convey, transfer, assign and make over unto the United States in Congress Assembled for the Benefit of the said States all right title and claim as well of soil as jurisdiction which this Commonwealth hath to the Territory or Tract of Country within the limits of the Virginia Charter situate lying and being to the North-West of the River Ohio subject to the Terms and Conditions contained in the before recited Act of Congress of the thirteenth day of September last that is to say upon condition that the Territory so ceded shall be laid out and formed into States containing a suitable extent of Territory not less than one hundred nor more than one hundred and fifty miles square or as near thereto as circumstances will admit and that the States so formed shall be distinct Republican States and admitted members of the Fderal Union, having the same rights of Sovereignty, Freedom and Independence as the other States1That the necessary and reasonable expences incurred by this State in subduing any British Posts or in maintaining Forts or Garrisons within and for the defence or in acquiring any part of the Territory so ceded or relinquished shall be fully reimbursed by the United States and that one Commissioner shall be appointed by Congress one by this Commonwealth and another by those two Commissioners who or a majority of them shall be authorized and empowered to adjust and liquidate the account of the necessary and reasonable expences incurred by this State which they shall judge to be comprized within the intent and meaning of the Act of Congress of the tenth of October one thousand seven hundred and Eighty respecting such expencesThat [579] the French and Canadian Inhabitants and other Settlers of the Kaskaskies, St. Vincents and the neighbouring Villages who have professed themselves Citizens of Virginia shall have their possessions and Titles confirmed to them and be protected in the enjoyment of their rights and libertiesThat a quantity not exceeding one hundred and fifty thousand Acres of Land promised by this State shall be allowed and granted to the then Colonel now General George Rogers Clarke and to the Officers and Soldiers of his Regiment who marched with him when the Posts of Kaskaskies and St. Vincents were reduced and to the Officers and Soldiers that have been since incorporated into the said Regiment to be laid off in one Tract the length of which not to exceed double the breadth in such place on the North-West side of the Ohio as a Majority of the Officers shall choose and to be afterwards divided among the said Officers and Soldiers in due proportion according to the Laws of Virginia. That in case the quantity of good Lands on the South-East side of the Ohio upon the Waters of Cumberland River and between the Green River and Tenessee river which have been reserved by Law for the Virginia Troops upon Continental establishment2 should from the North Carolina Line bearing in further upon the Cumberland Lands than was expected prove insufficient for their legal Bounties the deficiency should be made up to the said Troops in good Lands to be laid off between the Rivers Scioto and little Miami on the North-West side of the River Ohio in such proportions as have been engaged to them by the Laws of VirginiaThat all the Lands within the Territory so Ceded to the United States and not reserved for or appropriated to any of the beforementioned purposes or disposed of in Bounties to the Officers and Soldiers of the American Army shall be considered as a common fund for the use and benefit of such of the United States as have become or shall become Members of the Confederation or Fderal Alliance of the said States Virginia inclusive according to their usual respective proportions in the general charge and expenditure and shall be faithfully and bona fide disposed of for that purpose and for no other use or purpose whatsoever.
