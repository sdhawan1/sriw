Sir
Richmond October 12th. 1780.



Baker was to give notice to Colo. Crockett when he should have ready subsistence and pack horses for him. Colo. Matthews Suggestions [35] as to the Militia shall be submitted to the Council, and the result communicated to Colo Crockett.
I am sorry to hear that your Supplies of Provision are still precarious. Mr Divers has made a Proposition to victual the troops on contract, which we think to submit to the Assembly. What is your Opinion of such a mode? I would be glad to hear from you, on this Question, together with your Sentiments on the prospect of Subsistence in any other way, as early as possible.
I am Sir with great esteem Your most obedt humble servt.,

Th: Jefferson
