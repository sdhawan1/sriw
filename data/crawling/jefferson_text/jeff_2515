In Council, March 17, 1781



Col. Senf alone can say the extent of the works at the Fork and Westham. If it be possible to provide a better Hospital for the smallpox, it will be approved. I think the state Officers should be immediately informed of their discontinuance and orders issue to those who remain, to receive the Command.
