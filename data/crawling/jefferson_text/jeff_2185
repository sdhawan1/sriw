Sir
Feb. 16. 1781.



I think from every enquiry we shall find it impossible to get hats for the men at Chesterfeild. Could not a cap of cloth be made to answer? The grenadiers I beleive wear such. If you think it would do, could you help us to a model?
I am with much respect Sir your most obedt. sert.,

Th: Jefferson
