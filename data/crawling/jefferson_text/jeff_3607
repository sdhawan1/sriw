[Benjamin Hawkins] Merc. [John Francis Mercer][Joseph] Reed.Madis[on].European news. This was obviously written in reply to one that had been received from Mrs. Trist. In his letter to Martha of 19 Mch. TJ wrote: we have received a letter from her by a gentleman immediately from Fort Pitt, and from this it is clear that the letter was to TJ himself, despite his guarded use of the plural. But neither Mrs. Trists letter nor TJs of 17 Mch. to her has been found.]
