Richmond Jany. 12. 1781.



Colo. Muter is desired to make enquiry where any equipments for Cavalry are, and originate an order for furnishing Mr. Eppes, Dr. Griffin, Dr. Foushee, Mr. Hylton, Mr. Selden and others who are willing to enter into the service, with such as may be necessary and I will countersign it.
