Sir
Treasury Office, 12th. Apr. 1781.



We have no Continental Money on hand, and do not think any can be procured. There stil remains 950 Dollars 1 for 40. I imagine Specie could be purchased if you chuse to have it done.
I am Your Mo. Obedt. Servt.,


F. Webb jr. C.T. [Commissioner of the Treasury]
