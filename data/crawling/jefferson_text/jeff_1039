Sir
Coll May 2d. 1780



I receivd the Barrel of flour you was so kind as to send me, for which I am greatly obliged to you, but I am vastly concernd you have had so much troubles. The weight of the flour and cask is 242 .
I am sorry to hear that the negociations for the exchange of prisoners has faild, but we must make use of a little Philosophy and live in hopes the next trial will prove more successfull.
My Most respectfull Compts. to Mrs. Jefferson & I am Sir Your very Humble Servant,

P milius Irving
