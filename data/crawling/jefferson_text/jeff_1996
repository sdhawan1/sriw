New Castle, 1 Feb. 1781. Acknowledges TJs letter of 31 Jan. Has heard that Mr. Watkins (who is Very Anxious to Remove evry thing from Cumberland) has loaded 3 Vessells, now on their way with Shells, Shott &c. Shall they be Landed Here or Returnd? In obedience to Gen. Nelsons orders, Syme has ordered out his lower battalion of militia, but doubts the propriety of the order, which interferes with recruiting and which allows a still longer exemption to the men of the upper battalion. Refers to TJs observations in your Publick Letter and apologizes for his militia officers neglecting to make returns. Since corn is so plentiful and wagonage so dear, proposes that as much forage as possible be consumed where it grows.
