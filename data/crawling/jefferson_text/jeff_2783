[Richmond, 9 Apr. 1781. War Office Journal (Vi) contains the following minute under this date: Letter to his Excellency the Governor proposing Mr. Gilbert to superintend the public carpenters. Not found. A virtually identical entry appears some pages later in the War Office Journal, under the same date but among the May entries; it may be a mere repetition by a careless clerk or it may record a missing second letter on the same subject.]
