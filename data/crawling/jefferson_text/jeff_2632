[27 March 1781]



Your Excellency will perceive by the joined Letter from Majr. Genl. de Riedesel that I am lately sent by order of his Serene Highness the Duke of Brunswic to N. York with the Cloathing for the Convention Troops, now on board the Vessel Genl. Riedesel.
As I never served in America, and being sent here on this only purpose, with orders to return to Europe immediately after my [260] return to New York, I flatter myself, when the vessel has proceeded to her destination, Your Excellency will favor me by granting permission for me to bring myself the baggage to the troops of Convention.
