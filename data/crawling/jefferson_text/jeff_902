Williamsburg, 20 Jan. 1780. Because of the dissolution of the fourth troop of Nelsons corps of cavalry, a dispute concerning the lieutenancy of the third troop has arisen between Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Read. It is recommended that the decision be referred to a board of officers as the most proper Tribunal to determine all military disputes. Signed by Innes and Barron.
