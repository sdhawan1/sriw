Sir
Philadelphia Feby 7. 1781



The American Philosophic society on the 5th of January last held their first annual election under the act of incorporation by the General Assembly of Pennsylvania, and I have it in charge to inform your Excellency, that they have elected you a Councellor for two years. The powers of the Council are to be described, fixed and determined by the statutes, laws, regulations and ordnances of the said society hereafter to be made of which you will have due notice.
The members of this society flatter themselves, that the benevolent and liberal objects of it will induce you to give it your countenance and assistance and enable them to shew to posterity that in the midst of a bloody and unparalled war, where every moment was indeed precious, men of the first imminence in America cherished the arts and sciences and dedicated a part of their time to Philosophy.
I have the honor to be with great respect Your Excellencys Most obedient and very humble servt.,

T Matlack Secy. P.S.
