In council July 22nd 1779.



Approved as to the gallies; and as to the ship Gloster it is recommended to the board of war to have a proper enquiry and report made whether it may not be more advantageous to convert her into a galley than to sell her, and on such report to reconsider the matter.

Th: Jefferson
