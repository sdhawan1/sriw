Sir
Richmond April 14th. 1781



Your letter on the Subject of the Commission came duly to Hand but not having a Council it is out of my Power to have any Thing done with it. I somewhat question too whether if a permanent Commission be expected they would not suppose it necessary to have a [449] resignation from Major Buckner himself. If only a Commission during the Continuance of Your Men in the field be desired, such a Resignation might be dispensed with. I am &c,

T. J.
