Sir
War office Novr. 29. 1780.



My duty obliges me to inform your Excellency, that there are only twelve pigs of lead at Richmond and five at Westham, weighing about 150. each. I beg leave to add, that there is the most urgent necessity for a considerable quantity of leads being soon procured, otherwise the making of musket catridges must soon be at an end. There is only about 200. of ball and buck shott in the laboratory to make up.
I have the honour to be Your Excellencys Most humble servant,

George Muter. C.[W.]
