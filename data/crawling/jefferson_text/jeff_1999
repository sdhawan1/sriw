Sir
Washington Febr. 2d. 1781



This moment I have the intelligence that a Body of Indians (supposed to be Cherokees) attacked Blackmores Fort on Clinch, took four Men prisoners and has carryd off a considerable number of Horses. I must entreat the speedy attention of the Executive to my former proposals of a Garrison in Powells Valley; and on the [500] banks of the Tenasee, as absolutely necessary for the preservation of the Southwestern frontier and keeping up the communication to Kentucky.
I am Sir Your most Obedient Humble Servant,

Arthur Campbell
