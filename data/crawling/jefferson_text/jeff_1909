Sir
Cabbin Point Janury. 21st. 1781.



On my Return from below I received Your Excellencys two Letters, and have acquainted the Baron with the Contents of it, but the General has orderd me, that I first would go down with Him below to establish some Posts, which will probably take me five or Six Days.
As soon as I have done this Business, I shall wait directly on Your Excellency for Your further Orders.
I have the Honour to be with great Respect Your Excellencys most obedt. and most humble Servt.,


Jn. Christn. SenfColonel Engineer
