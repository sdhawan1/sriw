Washington [co.] 15 June 1781. Encloses a letter from Joseph Martin which explains the reference in Campbells letter of 4 June respecting an attack from the Indians and Tories from the South; in that letter Martin informs Campbell that about 300 Indians are on their way to attend the proposed treaty; recommends that Campbell come immediately; has sent an express to Col. Sevier to come as soon as possible; is informed that the alarm spread by Crawford is not to be credited but it has drawn all the forces that can be raised to the frontier.
