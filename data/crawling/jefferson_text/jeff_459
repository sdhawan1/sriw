Be it enacted by the General Assembly that there shall be a standing Board of Auditors for Public Accounts, to consist of three persons to be chosen from time to time, as vacancies shall happen, by joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly, and to continue in office until removed by the joint vote of both the said Houses; and where any person so appointed shall refuse to act, resign, or die, during the recess of Assembly, it shall be lawful for the Governor with advice of the Council of state, to appoint some other fit and able person to act in his stead, until the next meeting of the General Assembly.

and where such balance is due from the public to certify it in like manner to the Treasurer, and debit the party with such certificate: To enter in proper accounts all loan office certificates hereafter to be given, and endorse on such certificates that they are entered in the said Auditors office, without which endorsement no such certificate shall be valid: To require counsel of the Attorney General on all doubts in matters of law relative to the duties of their office: To state and keep all the accounts coming under their examination, specially against each person, so as to shew the amount of all warrants and certificates given on the Treasurer, for what service or article of public expence they were given, or where they have been, for money advanced, to whom it was advanced, and for what purpose, and to preserve the vouchers in due order: And also to raise general accounts shewing the amount of the expenditures for the army, the navy, the militia, the public trade, the public works and manufactories of every kind, of pensions, claims, and all other expences of government, each stated in a collective view, under its separate and proper head, and to lay before the Assembly annually the said general accounts together with an account of all balances due to and from the public as nearly as they shall be able.
And it is farther enacted, that it shall not be lawful for the Treasurer to pay or receive any money on account of the public but on warrant or certificate from the Board of Auditors, unless in cases where any future act of Assembly shall in express words, and not by inference or implication only, declare that in that particular case it is to be understood as the intention, that the claim specified by such act shall not be audited in the regular course, save only that the salaries of the said Auditors, together with the accounts for the expences of their office for fuel, blank books, paper, presses for the preservation of their books and papers, and other implements necessary for the use of their office, shall be examined and certified for payment to the Treasurer by the Governor and Council. The said Auditors shall be allowed a clerk of accounts and an assistant clerk, to be appointed by themselves from time to time at their will, who, before entering on the exercise of their office, shall take the like oath and in like manner as is before directed for the said Auditors to take. Where the Auditors acting according to their discretion and judgment shall disallow or abate any article of demand against the commonwealth, and any person shall think himself agrieved thereby, he shall be at liberty to petition the High Court of [374] Chancery or the General Court, according to the nature of his case, for redress, and such court shall proceed to do right thereon, and a like petition shall be allowed in all other cases to any other person who is intitled to demand against the commonwealth any right in law or equity.
