Sir
Richmond 5th. Febry. 1781.



The Executive are Shortly to proceed to the reformation of the State Forces according to a resolution of Assembly. As your commission is the oldest it is probable the Council will be of opinion that you are entitled to a continuance in command, and I think they will consider it as fortunate that they will be at liberty to continue you; from what passed in conversation when I had the pleasure of seeing you I apprehended you did not mean to remain in Service. I shall be very glad to know your wishes before We proceed to this business as I shoud be anxious to retain your Services if not entirely disagreeable to you, and if you were determined to retire [528] that this might be effected on the footing you woud prefer. Your answer will oblige Sir Your very humble Servt.,

Th: Jefferson
