Sir
War office Feby. 7. 1781.



I have a letter from the quarter master, in which he informs me That the cartridge blocks at Moodys shop as well as those that were in his possession, were all destroyed by the enemy; and that since then he has not been able to procure a single workman to make more: but that he will use every exertion in his power to push a bussiness so essential at this critical period. He cannot assign any reason for the delay of the waggons that went to Charlottsville, and supposes that the leather probably was not ready. When the waggons arrive he will inform immedeatly.
Permitt me to observe, that Mr. Braxtons letter to the gentleman in whose hands he expects the Cartouch boxes at Annapolis are, is still here. I have the honour to be Your Excellencys most humble servant,

George Muter. C.
