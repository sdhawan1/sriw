Sir
In Council March 30th. 1781



Being called on for Swords for General Spotswoods two Legions, and for our Cavalry on Continental establishment, to be procured [297] immediately, You will be so good as to order five hundred to be made at Mr. Hunters. General Spotswood I suppose will chuse to direct the form of those to be made for his Legions. The Residue we would be glad to have made on a model which will be lodged with Mr. Hunter by Major Call. I am &c.,

T. J.
