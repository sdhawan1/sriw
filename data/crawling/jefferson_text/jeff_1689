Sir
In Council Dec. 29. 1780.



The inclosed resolution of Congress came to hand yesterday. As it is on the same subject with the resolution of Assembly of 23d. Decr. I beg leave to lay it before them. That the Assembly may be informed of the footing on which this matter stood at the time of their resolution I beg leave to inclose to them an extract from my Letter to Colo. Wood giving a general order for the removal of the whole Convention troops, and a second one which for reasons strongly urged by him suspended the removal of the Germans for a time. These Measures when taken were duly communicated to Congress and to Governor Lee and were approved of by Congress. What circumstances may have induced an alteration in their opinion I am uninformed. I conjecture however that some difficulty on the subject of provisions has arisen; for by a Letter from the board of war which came to hand with this resolution we are called on to furnish half the provisions necessary f[or] that part of the Conventioners who are gone on, and to transport this to Frederic town in Maryland. Against this I mean to remonstrate and have no doubt of satisfying Congress that this requisition has been too hastily adopted. But I should be glad to be advised by the Assembly how to conduct myself should the inclosed resolution of Congress be adhered to on their part: as our rights of jurisdiction cease at our boundary.
I have the honor to be with the greatest respect Sir Your mo: obedt. & mo: hble. Servant,

Th: Jefferson
