Octr. 20. 1772.



I received your favour by []st and thank you for the various intellig[ence. The?] Genl. Courts determination concern[ing] the [96] devise of slaves must be attended w[ith] Mischievious consequences. I have hea[rd] nothing about dear Patty since you left this place. Our sale of Slaves go[es] on Slowly so tis uncertain when we shall be down but I suppose before the Rebel party leaves town. I am Your afft. Svt.,

J. Wayles
