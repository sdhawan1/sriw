[Annapolis, 24 Apr. 1784. Entry in SJL reads: McLurg. Ballons28. [i.e., postscript of 28 Apr.] adjournment of Congr.Eng. news to [116] Mar. 25 ut infra. Not found, but the phrase ut infra in the entry in SJL for the present letter which occurs above that for the letter to Randolph of 28 Apr. 1784, q.v., and the corresponding phrase ut supra in the entry for the letter to Turpin of the same date which occurs just below the Randolph entry suggest that TJ regarded the latter as the master-entry for this subject.]
