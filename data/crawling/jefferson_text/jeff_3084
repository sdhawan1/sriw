Dear Sir
Richmond May 15. 1781.



I have lodged with Mrs. Sherrar a small box of books containing Chandlers debates of the lords and commons (one volume lost) and the Historical register of which I beg your acceptance.
I am just now setting out to Monticello where I shall be happy to see you at all times, should health or curiosity lead you thither or a willingness to give that pleasure to Dr. Sir your friend & humble servt,

Th: Jefferson
