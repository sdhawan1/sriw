Sir
Paris May 12. 1785.



I have the honor to inform you that at length Messrs. Laval & Wilfelsheim have paid the bill of exchange remitted. It will enable me to furnish Monsr. Houdon for his voiage to Virginia when he [152] shall be sufficiently reestablished in his health to undertake it. Dr Franklin proposing to return either the next month or the month following, I think it probable that Houdon will accompany him.
I have the honour to be with due respect your Excellencys most obedt. & most humble servt.,

Th: Jefferson
