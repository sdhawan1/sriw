Sir
Hd. Qrs. Morris Town 11 Decr. 1779



I inclose your Excellency a number of papers relative to a certain Richard Bird, and the money mentioned in Gen. Tylers letter. Col. Nevil takes charge of the prisoner. I give your Excellency this trouble as he appears to be the person some time ago advertised in a Virginia paper for the commission of some crime.
I am &c.
