Sir
War office April 13. 1781.



As it would be proper for us, I suppose, to make use of the same kind of parole that the British require of us, which is very restricted in its terms, I will be obliged to your Excellency to favor me with a copy or the original parole signed by Govr. Hamilton. I am your Excellencys most obdt servt.,

William Davies
