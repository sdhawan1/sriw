Chesterfield, 11 Mch. 1781. Forwards a number of letters taken from a packet addressed to Steuben; Steubens letters have been forwarded by express. Some time ago replied to TJs inquiry concerning dressing deer skins that this could be done but has heard nothing further concerning them. A greater quantity of leather and two sets of shoemakers tools are needed. The clothier contracted for 400 shirts and agreed to pay for them on delivery, which will be in a fortnight. He has advanced his own money on several occasions, and has not yet been paid: he has it not in his power to advance this sum without injury to himself. Urges that $10,000 be spared him on this emergency. With this supply we shall be able to make the Virginians under General Greene much more comfortable. Encloses a letter to be forwarded to Col. Darke; it was written by the Generals orders, is of some consequence and relates to the Assembly and forwarding the new levies.
