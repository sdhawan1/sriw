Sir
In Council August 14th: 1780.



Colo. Gibsons regiment being now equipped for service, I take the liberty of putting them under your orders. I understand many of them are sick. You will be pleased to judge whether it will be better to bring them to the hospital in Chesterfield or not. I am sir Your most obedient servant,

Th: Jefferson
