Sir
Feby 11. 1781



I have been in search of Warneck but can-not find him. He shall certainly wait on your Excellency and the Council to morrow forenoon, that his affair may be determined finally, if he is in this place.
I have the honour of inclosing a note to the Commissary of Stores to provide some tacks for covering two waggons that want only covering with canvas to fitt them for taking in the ammunition, the wooden work being already done.
Since writing the above, I have received your Excellencys note. I am now at Mr. Roses but he is not at home. I believe the waggons mentioned above, must be those he meant, I have heard of no other, and they were ordered to be fitted some time agoe, the want of tacks (I am told now) has prevented their being compleated. For fear I shoud be mistaken in the waggons, I shall goe immedeatly to Mr. Smiths to get what information I can there respecting them, and trye every possible means to push off the ammunition quickly.
I have the honour to be Your Excellencys most hl Servt.,

George Muter
