whatsoever,
Agreed[Authorial note. Position in source: margin] and shall be obliged to observe no other or greater formalities, regulations or cautions, than the most favored European nations are or shall be obliged to pay and observe.
exemptions
Agreed[Authorial note. Position in source: margin] in navigation and commerce exemptions for their persons and property and in navigation and commerce.
the most favored nation the most favored European nation. Here and in Art. 4. et pass[im].
to
[Art.] 4.[Authorial note. Position in source: margin] carry their own produce manufactures and merchandize in their own vessels to carry any kinds of produce, manufactures and merchandize of whatsoever place or growth in their own or in any other vessels.
where
Agreed[Authorial note. Position in source: margin] it shall be lawful for all the subjects and citizens of that other freely to purchase &c. No change proposed here; but we should propose as with the K. of P. to substitute persons for the subjects and citizens of that other.bis.
Form in which I should be for agreeing to this Article.
More especially each party shall have a right to carry any kinds of produce, manufactures and merchandize of whatever place they be the growth or manufacture in their own or any other vessels to any parts of the dominions of the other where it shall be lawful for all persons freely to purchase them and thence to take the produce, manufactures and merchandize of [the other]
[of whatever place or growth]1[Authorial note. Position in source: margin]1 which all persons shall in like manner be free to sell them, paying in both cases such duties, charges and fees, and observing such formalities, regulations and cautions only as are or shall be paid or observed by the most favored nation. Nevertheless his royal highness and the United states and each of them reserve to themselves the right where any nation restrains the transportation of merchandize to the vessels of the country of which it is the growth produce or manufacture to establish against such nation retaliating regulations: and also the right to prohibit in their respective countries the importation and exportation of all merchandize whatsoever when [106] reasons of state shall require it. In this case the subjects or citizens of the contracting parties shall not import nor export the merchandize prohibited by the other. But if one of the contracting parties permits any other nation to import or export the same merchandize, the citizens or subjects of the other shall immediately enjoy the same liberty.
All merchants &c. or any part thereof for them:
[Art.] 5.[Authorial note. Position in source: margin]provided the person so employed be thereto authorized: nor shall they be obliged to make use of any interpreter &c. unless they chuse to make use of them. And as to the lading and unlading their vessels and the transportation of their merchandize they shall use the public porters in places where they are or shall be established according to the regulations of the respective custom houses, and pay them the fees established by tariff, in those cases only nevertheless in which they have the right of transportation, being at liberty in all others to make use of such persons as they shall think proper without paying salaries or fees to any others. Nor shall they be forced to unload any sort of merchandize into any other vessels, or to receive them into their own, or to wait for their being loaded longer than they please. And generally with respect to the contents of this article each party, shall observe towards the other what shall be practised in their respective countries towards the most favoured European nation.
Better omit all the first and last parts of this article and let it stand as with the K. of P. respecting the unloading of vessels to wit. The merchants commanders of vessels or other subjects or citizens of either party shall not within the ports or jurisdiction of the other be forced to unload &c. [as above]1longer than they please.
Addition
Art. 6.[Authorial note. Position in source: margin] proposed by the G. D. to the end of this, viz. [and moreover the laws of the respective countries shall be observed with respect to vessels having, or having had, on board prohibited articles,]1
Strike out this as useless or explain it Is not this also useless?[Authorial note. Position in source: margin] and they shall receive on board the usual guards of the custom houses, in those cases in which a similar caution is practised with the vessels of other the most favored nations of Europe. And the like cautions shall in the same manner be observed when such articles shall be unladed.
If any delinquent
Useless also[Authorial note. Position in source: margin] in the ports of either of the parties shall escape on board the vessels of the other, he shall, on demand, be immediately [107] delivered to the government, and the respective Consuls, when there shall be any, shall give all possible assistance herein: and if ever delivery shall be refused, such delinquents may be freely and forcibly taken on board the vessel. The same shall be practised if any of the crew of the vessel shall commit any crime, a liberty being always reserved to do on board the same whatever may be necessary for the execution of justice.
There seems to be an omission of or being entered into port
[Art.] 8. Reestablished[Authorial note. Position in source: margin] or break bulk they shall2 send their boat ashore and yeild due obedience, and give an account of themselves to the posts established for that purpose, but they shall have liberty to depart &c.account of their cargo: saving what is agreed on in the 6th. article respecting prohibited articles, but they shall pay anchorage and
The preservation of [propose to insert these]1[Authorial note. Position in source: margin] other expences and duties for3 the port, and those concerning the cautions as to health, when such are practised with the most favored European nations.
Better as with the K. of P. or to pay any duties charges or fees whatsoever except those established for vessels entered into port and appropriated to the maintenance of the port itself or of other establishments for the safety and convenience of navigators, which duties charges and fees shall be the same, and shall be paid on the same footing as in the case of subjects or citizens of the country where they are established. [add]1 submitting to the precautions and regulations established in the health offices on the same footing also with the natives of the place.
9. that the whole or any part of their cargo be unladed, the same

And where on the death &c. And in the case of real estate, if in the state where it is situated there exist laws which forbid
