[4 June 1780]



I receive with great satisfaction this testimony of the public approbation, and beg leave through you gentlemen, to return my sincere thanks to the General Assembly. I shall cheerfully again encounter the anxieties and assiduities inseparable from the important office to which you are pleased a second time to call me, and only wish to be able to call forth those effectual exertions of my[418] country, which our friends expect, and the present emergency requires.
