[Annapolis, 19 Dec. 1783. Entry in SJL reads: Sp. Sen. European intelligenceextract from letter of Ministersproposition on G. town to Del. of Maryld. Letter and enclosure not found, but see TJs letter to Benjamin Harrison, 17 Dec. 1783, and note. The phrase proposition on G. town (i.e., Georgetown) clearly refers to a proposal TJ, presumably with other members of the Virginia delegation, must have made to the Maryland delegates in Congress; nothing further is known [392] of this, but it probably involved TJs resolution for joint action by Virginia and Maryland to fix the seat of Congress on the Potomac (see Document v in Notes and Memoranda by Madison and TJ, printed above at end of Nov. 1783).]
