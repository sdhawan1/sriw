Gentlemen
Paris July 13. 1785.



I had the honour of your letter of June 21. inclosing one from Mr. Alexander of June 17. and a copy of his application to Monsr. de Calonnes. I am very sensible that no trade can be on a more desperate footing than that of tobacco in this country; and that our merchants must abandon the French markets if they are not [292] permitted1 to sell the productions they bring on such terms as will enable them to purchase reasonable returns in the manufactures of France. I know but one remedy to the evil; that of allowing a free vent: and I should be very happy in being instrumental to the obtaining this. But while the purchase of tobacco is monopolized by a company, and they pay for that monopoly a heavy price to the government, they doubtless are at liberty to fix such places and terms of purchase as may enable them to make good their engagements with government. I see no more reason for obliging them to give a greater price for tobacco than they think they can afford than to do the same between two individuals treating for a horse, a house, or any thing else. Could this be effected by applications to the minister, it would only be a palliative which would retard the ultimate cure which every friend to this country as well as to America should wish for and aim at.
I have the honour to be Gentlemen Your most obedient humble servt.,

Th: Jefferson
