Sir
Richmd. Febry. 5th. 1781.



I have received particular information that Richard Overby and Richard Wills two of Capt. Hardaways company1 of Militia of your county lately on duty below have deserted and carried off their arms; as they are triable by a Court-Martial of the Officers remaining in the field, I am to desire you to exert every effort to [527] have them taken and when taken to send them under guard to Cabbin point or wherever else the principal encampm[ent] shall be.
I am with much respect Sir Your most Obt.,

T. Jefferson
