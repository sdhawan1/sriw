Marbois, Consul general, and Secretary to the above legation; And that although a warrant for apprehending the offender has been duly issued, in consequence of directions given by the President of the State of Pensylvania, upon application to him made for that purpose by the said Minister, he has not yet been apprehended, but absconds, and is supposed to have fled from Justice, into some other of these United States, Wherefore to the end the said Longchamps may be brought to condign punishment for his said offence, and that the privileges and immunities of foreign Ministers, and of their Families and Houses be preserved inviolate,
