Richmond, 21 Apr. 1781. Difficulties of Hays brother, whose rheumatism prevents him from paying the least attention to his Bussiness and whose two Store Boys are now under Marching Orders, so that [520] his Store with a large Quantity of Goods must be left to the Mercy of the Negroes &c.  Among the Goods now in the Store there is at least One hundred Pieces of Sail Duck of the best Quality which I conceive ever to be an object of Public Attention. Mr. Nicolson by being Permitted to attend the Store would be able to have them removed.
