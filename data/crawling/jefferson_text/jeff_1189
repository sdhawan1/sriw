Headquarters [Preakness, N.J.] 22 July 1780. Has just received a letter from Gen. Muhlenberg of 11 July enclosing a list of officers in Col. Gists regiment, omitted in his former return, and has written to Gen. Gates to incorporate these officers with the others or to divide the Drafts into another Regiment as may appear most eligible from a view of all circumstances.
