Sir
In Council Richmond Nov. 13. 1780



I take the liberty of enclosing your Excellency a copy of a letter I received from Colo. Wood. As the determination whether he shall [116] be allowed travelling expenses rests with Congress alone, we could only communicate his application to that honourable Body.
I have the honor to be with the greatest Respect &c &c.,

Th: Jefferson
