Sir
Hampton March 20. 1781



Yesterday Morning twelve large Ships Came within the Capes and Anchord, Sent up one Frigate this Morning under English Colours, Which proves them to be a British fleet. The Frigate lays Now in Hampton road with Arnolds Ships. The other Ships are still in the Bay at Anchor. I take them all to be Menawar And No transports Among them.
I Have the Honour, to be Sir Yr. Excellencys Mo. Obed. Hble Sevt.,
