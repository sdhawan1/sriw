[28 April 1781]



I have this instant received notice that the Enemy appears to be again in motion at Osburns. I have dispatcht a Vidett to recoinoitre them, and am collecting some negroes to hew down Trees and be ready to take up the different Bridges in their rout. There is [571] no Officer on this side but myself. I desire to know if you have any commands.
I am Sir &c.,
