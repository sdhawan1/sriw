Sir
[21? April 1781]



The main body of the enemy are landed at Mrs. Morecocks in this country at the mouth of Chickahominy, supposed to be about twelve hundred. Their object I suppose to be the ships in that river. They came up in the night in about twenty flat-bottomed boats covered by a ship and a brig.
I am &c.
