Sir
Charlottesville May 23d. 1781



Your letters of the 18th and 19th inst. came to hand yesterday. Experience has for some time past convinced the Council that as the mode of acquiring1 waggons, horses &c. by Impress is the most irritating, so it is the most expensive which can be adopted. They therefore have generally meant to discontinue Impresses and to have purchases made wherever a delay can be admitted. And indeed it is questionable where necessity obliges the public to have an article on the spot whether any price which the owner would ask to part with it voluntarily would not be less than appraisers would rate it at.
In answer therefore to your Letter I can only advise your procuring the necessaries required by purchase. In a conversation which I had with Mr. Lyne, I mentioned the necessity of paying your Warrants as quickly as possible. He was sensible of it and I can say will pay it as soon as he has as much money. I am2 with much respect Sir your obt. servant,

Th: Jefferson
