Sir
Williamsburg Jan. 3. 1780.



A large packet directed to the President of Congress with other dispatches for the Chevalier de la Luzerne and others, coming to my hands two days ago, I thought it proper to forward them to you by express. He should have set out yesterday but it was too tempestuous. I have the honor to be with all possible respect Your Excellencys most obedient & most humble servt.,

Th Jefferson
