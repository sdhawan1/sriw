And that ferries be kept, opposite to all the places hereby appointed, across the rivers Rappahannock, Piankatank, York, James and Nottoway below the falls thereof; and the several county courts are impowered to appoint opposite ferries, where they shall judge it necessary, at all other places herein appointed, above the falls of the said rivers, or across any branches thereof; also on such parts of the rivers Potowmack and Roanoake, or their branches, as have places hereby established for ferries, where both sides are within this commonwealth; and the several keepers of such opposite ferries shall be intitled to the rates of ferriage herein allowed at the place, and be subject to all the regulations of this act. But this shall not extend to any ferry which by a former law is vested on both sides in any person or persons: All which ferries shall remain subject to the regulations of the several acts of Assembly, by which they were respectively established.
And for the transportation of wheel carriages, tobacco, or live stocks, at either of the ferries hereby, or hereafter to be established; the ferry keepers may respectively demand the rates following, to wit:
For every coach, chariot, or waggon, and the driver, the same as for six horses.
For every four wheeled chaise, or phton, and the driver, or cart, as for four horses.
For every two wheeled riding carriage as for two horses.
For every hogshead of tobacco, or head of neat cattle, as for one horse.
For every sheep, goat, or lamb, one fifth part of the ferriage of one horse.
For every hog one fourth part of the ferriage of one horse.
[462]
If any ferry keeper shall demand and take from a passenger a greater rate than is herein allowed for ferriage, he or she shall forfeit, for every offence, the sum over charged, and ten shillings, to the party grieved, recoverable, with costs, before any Justice of the Peace in the county where the offence shall be committed.1
The several county courts are hereby empowered to appoint a ferry over any river or creek, within their respective counties, where they shall judge the same convenient, and settle the rate of ferriage, and may contract with the keeper of such ferry, or of any public ferry, within the county, for setting over the militia, on muster days, and to make an allowance for the same, in their county levy.
The said courts are also impowered and required to order and direct what boat or boats, and the number of hands which shall be kept at each ferry, appointed, or to be appointed, within their respective counties; and the owner of the land from whence the ferry is, or shall be, shall, withinfrom the commencement of this act, give bond, with security, in the penalty ofpayable to the Justices of the said court, and their successors, with condition, that he or she will duly cause such ferry to be kept, according to law, and give immediate dispatch to all passengers, public messengers and expresses when required. And if such owner shall fail to give security, within the time aforesaid, and, being summoned to appear at the county court, shall fail to appear, or appearing, shall refuse, or be unable, to procure such security, the court shall have power, upon the application of any other person, to order the sheriff to summon a jury of twelve good and lawful men, to meet at the ferry landing; who, being sworn by the sheriff or under sheriff attending, shall view and value an acre of land, to be laid off convenient to include the landing; and as little prejudicial as may be to the owner, and return their inquisition to the next court; and thereupon, unless the proprietor shall then appear, enter into bond with security as aforesaid, and pay down the costs of the proceedings, the court may grant the ferry to the petitioner, upon his giving such security, and paying down to the proprietor the valuation of the acre of land, of which the petitioner shall be from thenceforth seized in fee simple.2
All expresses, sent by the Governor, or Commander in Chief, to any person or persons, on public business, or sent to the Governor, by the General Congress, the Commander in Chief of the American army, or Commanding Officer of any detachment thereof, or of any militia of this state, in actual service; or by any Field Officer of the militia, to the Governor, or to the Commanding [463]  Officer of the militia, in an adjacent county, to give intelligence of an invasion, or insurrection, or of the approach of an enemy, shall be deemed public expresses, and ferry free, in case the dispatches, by such express, be directed, for public service, and such direction be signed by the person sending the same.
All the men, attending public ferries, shall be free from county and public levies, from attendance at musters, clearing highways, impressments and other service of a like nature; and every ferry keeper shall be intitled to a license for keeping ordinary, at his ferry, upon application to the county court, notwithstanding there may be a sufficient number of other ordinaries in the county.
If any person, other than a ferry keeper, shall, for reward, set any person or persons, carriages, horses, or stocks, over any river, or creek, whereon ferries are or shall be established, he or she so offending, shall forfeit and pay five pounds, for every offence, to the ferry keeper nearest to the place where the offence shall be committed, to be recovered, with costs, by action of debt, or information, in any court of record, wherein the same is cognizable; neither shall any person, for reward, set any person, carriage, horses, or stocks, over the Bay of Chesapeak, from Northampton county, or from Accomack county, other than the inhabitants thereof to York, Hampton, or Norfolk towns, or any other place, adjacent thereto, under the like penalty, to the keeper of the ferry from Hungars to the said towns, to be recovered as aforesaid.
The Justices of the county of Surry, at the charge of the county, shall cause to be constantly kept and maintained a bridge, over Hog Island creek; for the convenience of passing to and from the ferry at Fort Point, on that Island, under the penalty of one thousand pounds of tobacco, upon every Justice neglecting, or refusing, to keep and maintain such bridge in sufficient repair.
