Sir
Charlottesville May 28th 1781



I formerly desired Mr. Ross to write to you for five hundred horsemens Swords made on the Model of the one lodged with you (I believe) by order of Colo. Washington. I must now desire you will add five hundred more to that Number and urge you in the strongest Terms to employ every hand you possibly can in making them; also to let me know what number are ready and how many we may expect by the Week.
Should Colo. Fitzgerald have sent the Incyclopedie to you I shall be obliged to you to contrive it to Winchester if possible as that place will be safer even than this: should he not have sent it be so good as to forward to him the inclosed Letter.
Lord Cornwallis from Carolina and a Reinforcement of 2000 Men from New York have joined Arnold and crossed James River. I am &c.,

Thomas Jefferson
