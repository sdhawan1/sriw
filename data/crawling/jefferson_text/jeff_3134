Sir
Green Brier County 29th. May 1781



Agreeable to your Excellencys Instructions I have held a Court Martial to enquire into the Delinquencies which have happened by Persons of the Militia neglecting to perform their Tour of Duty, the Number of Delinquents here are few; and am at a loss how to have them Marched to the place directed to, in your Instructions, as no person here will undertake to perform the Duty upon the Terms mentioned in your Excellencys Letter; this makes me request your farther Instructions how I am to proceed in this affair. I am Sir Your Excellencys Obt. Hble Servant,

Andw. Donnally
