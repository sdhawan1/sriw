Sir
Richmond April 26th. 1781



I have advised with the Members of the Council present, and they are of Opinion that Captn. Reed be permitted to purchase four horses for his Troop instead of the four which were to have been purchased by the Quarter Master and one other instead of the one lately dead, governing himself by the price limited in the Order to the Quarter Master. I am &c.,

T. J.
