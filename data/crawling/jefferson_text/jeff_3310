[In Congress, 24 Jan. 1783.] The Committee instructed on the motion of Col. Bland to report a list of books proper for the use of Congress, recommend that Superintdt. of Finance and the Secy. of Congress be empowered to take order for procuring the books enumerated below; the same when procured to be under the care of the said Secy. The list itself, entirely in James Madisons hand, is headed by the Encyclopdie Mthodique and contains more than 300 other titles classed as follows: Law of Nature and Nations, Treaties and Negociations, General History, Chronology, Geography, Particular History (subdivided by nations), Politics, Law, War, Marine, Languages, America. (The last class, consisting of what would today be called Americana, contains by far the greatest number of titles.) Madisons list was largely, but not exclusively, based on a much longer book list compiled by TJ, consisting partly of books he owned and partly of books he intended to procure (Brant, Madison, ii, 28890). This 1783 Catalogue of TJs (MS in MHi) was presumably drawn up, or at least revised, in preparation for TJs contemplated mission to Europe; much of the work on it may have been done while he was in Philadelphia in Jan. 1783, and perhaps more on his return to Philadelphia in March of that year, since a preliminary leaf of the list bears the date 1783 Mar. 6. Madison and TJ roomed in the same house during these months and certainly must have discussed both TJs long personal list and Madisons select list for a proposed congressional library.
