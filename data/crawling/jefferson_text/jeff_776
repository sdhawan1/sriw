The Board having not in possession a Regular and proper Roster [167] of the State Artillery, cannot certify precisely how far the chain of preferment occasioned by Colonel Muters removal may extend. We have specified the field promotions, and will notify those of a more subordinate nature as soon as we are acquainted therewith.
