We wrote thee  Capt. Necks wth Accot Curt this now Covers the Sale of thy 12 Hds Tobacco  Lewis & 12  Esten.1 we are sorry it clears no more the former was owing to the heavy Charges it came home under & the latter mutilated the Tobacco being much out of condition so that the Buyers for home Consumption would not meddle wth but one Hd. We assure thee that no Care or attention is wanting in us to make the most of thy Tobacco. It gives us concern that we are not favourd any part of thy Crops  Capt. Esten this year.2 hope for it  one of the latter Ships & if it turns out quite fine Tobacco it will give us an additional pleasure as it will then fetch a tollerable good price; midling & ordinary sells very low. In thy next please to advise if we shall debit D.P. Custiss Estt. for the 14 Hds Tobo  the Joseph & give J.P. Custis Credit for it or if thee would have it stand to the Credit of the former as  Accot Currt sent.3 We are wth Esteem Thy Assurd Friends
