I have disposed of the Kittocktan Tract to Mr Threlkeld for something more than you mentioned; but I would not have done it for 50 more if I had thought You wanted it and was not in immediate Want of Money.1
I shall be glad to know what Sort of Money You would choose to receive and at what Rates, and when You sett off to Williamsburg that if possible I may wait on You in Time.
Our Compliments to Mrs Washington & Mr & Mrs Custis. I am Dear Sir Yr most obedt Servt
