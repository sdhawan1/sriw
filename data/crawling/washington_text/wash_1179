Alexandria July 15th 1757



I am favord with yours,1 Mr Barnes Accepts your proposals. Mr Barnes did not doubt the goodness of the Mine, but was rather too sanguine in his expectations from the prospect. As he was incumbred he hopd to raise three or four hundred pounds that way, but was to return it if the Search shoud not answer, by the Sale of the whole Land, if not otherwise to be Accomplishd.
I have engagd you two Shares, Mr Carlyle two, which are all that are to be disposd off. I suppose you will give Mr Carlyle instructions with regard to your Share, if I can be of any service you know you may commd me2A Gentn in Town Yesterday from the Head of the Bay says we may depend on the Fleets being Arrivd, if so, we may hope to have it confirmd next postThere are already employd in the Works 6 Men, two more I think will be enough to carry on two Shafts at a time, & if Industrious, three Months may determine our search, at four. I wish you great Success in this & all your other enterprizes & am with regard Dr Sr Your Affectionate H. Servant
