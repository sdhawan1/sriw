Dear Sir
Dogues Neck 16th May 1758



I am favourd wth Yrs of the 8th Inst.  French Mason, & am perfectly satisfied wth the Justice of Yr Reasons for not providing for him in Yr Regiment at this Time[.]1 I am convinced, from Yr State of the Case, that it coud not well have been done without prejudicing the ServiceHe tells Me You were kind enough to promise him a Commission the next Vacancy that happens. I shoud have been very glad his Fortune woud have supported him as a Voluntier: both he & I were very fond of his entering as such in Yr Regiment; but I really did not think it advisable that he shoud run his own little Estate in Debt upon the Occasion: You know what kind of an Establishment our
[186]
Virga Troops are onNobody can tell how soon they may all be disbanded, without any provision for a broken Leg, or a shortned Arm! or if they shoud happen to be kept up for a good many Years, how possible is it for an Officer to be reduced without being guilty, or so much as accused of any Misbehaviour? Faith these are discourageing Circumstances. On the British Establishment a young fellow may venture to dip his Estate a little on the Road to preferment, where he is sure, if he behaves well, that a Commission is some Sort of a provision for Life; but here I really think a young Man who enters into the Service, & has but a small Estate of his own ought if possible to preserve it unimpaird, to return to, in Case of a Disappointment, or an AccidentThese Reasons have influenced Me to dissuade French Mason from entering as a Voluntier, & as he is very fond of trying a Soldiers Life, & indeed I found it absolutely necessary that he shoud do so, as the only Means of getting clear of a very foolish Affair he is likely to fall into with a Girl in this Neighbourhood, I have advised him to enlist in the new Regiment, if he can be made a Serjeant: my Reason for advising him to enlist in that Regiment, is that if he shoud be disappointed in getting a Commission, he may if he pleases, quit the Service the first of December next; whereas from the Act of Assembly it appears to Me that the Men who enlist in the old Regiment may be detaind as long as any Troops are kept up in the pay of this Government; at least it may admit of a Dispute2I speak this to you only as my own private Opinion without any Intention of making it public to the prejudice of the recruiting Service.
If he shoud have the good fortune to get a Commission, tho he will accept of the first that offers in either Regiment he will prefer an Ensignsy in Yr Regiment to a Lieutenancy in the other, & I have advised him if he shoud get a Comn in Colo. Byrds Regiment to exchange it if he can by any Means for one in Yours3I shall relye Sir on Your good Offices in his Favour whenever a Vacancy happens, & I flatter myself that, by a strict Aherence to his Duty, he will strive to deserve Your good OpinionI very sincerely wish You Health & every Felicity & am Dr Sir Yr most obd: Sevt

G. Mason
