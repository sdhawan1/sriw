To Captain Robert Stewart. of the Light-Horse, at Conogochieg. Sir,
[Winchester, 2 June 1756]



I received yours, and observe the contents:1 The Bearer
[192]
added, that seven other Indians were seen. This I gave no credit to, as it was not certified in the Letter.
The Assembly have resolved that their Troops shall not march out of the Colony: whether this is binding on the whole, or only the Draughts, I know not; therefore I would not advise your going into Maryland, unless it be to procure some manifest advantage to Virginia; in keeping the Enemy out of it &c. To range for and search them in another province, I can not think consistent with the intention of the Assembly. Nor is it the design of the Assembly or Governoras the men are raised solely for the Defence of the Colony, and not acting in conjunction with other Corps; that Governor Sharpe, or his Officers, shoud have any connection with them. You are therefore to pay no regard to any orders that you may receive from him or any other than the Governor of Virginia, myself, or your Superior officers in the Virginia Regiment.2 The instant this comes to hand dispatch Captain Gist to this place, that he may settle his recruiting accompt before I go to Williamsburgh. I only wait his arrival, and shall do it impatiently, unless he is expeditious3His stay here may be long: Perhaps he may be ordered to accompany the Associators4therefore he should order his things to follow him.
Captain Bell, with all his men that are here, sets out to-day to join youLet Sergeant Hughess Recruits be sent to this place in their room.
The Pay master attends Captain Bell and will pay off all the Recruits to the first of May5He will also pay Sergeant Hughess recruiting accompt: and from thence will proceed to Williamsburgh to meet me. Yours &c.

G:W.
June 2d 1756.
