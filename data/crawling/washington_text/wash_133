To Carter Burwell Esqr.\Chairman of the Military Commee Williamsburgh/Sir
[Mount Vernon, 20 April 1755]



From the goodness \kindness/ of your offer last Assembly,1 I flatter myself you will be kind enough \so obliging as/ to acquaint the Gentlemen of the Committee (at this \eir next/ meeting) with the loss I sustaind during my Appointment as Paymaster to the Virginia Forces (either by Robery, or neglect of charging) and so far favour my Pretensions as to sollicit them in my behalf, which I am convinced will \propose the reimbursement of itYour interest in this matter will I am persd/ be a \the/ means of their refunding me the money I lost to the amount of \of my obtaining/ 50 odd pounds \which I have lost/I shoud not have presumd to ask this favr, (nor shall I in any shape urge \press/ it) as the Gentlemen were so kind \good as/ to grant \make/ me an allowance for my trouble \in paying out the money/ if I had not, in other respects, sufferd considerably in the Service;2 for beside\s/ the loss of many valuable Papers, a valuable Servant (who died a few days after of his Wounds)3 my \Stores/ wearing Apparel, Books, \&/ Horses, &ca which amounted to no trifling Sum in the whole, and in which I alone sufferd \was in a manner singular/ by being the only person who got out their things but a few days \their baggage up/ before the Engagement I say not to mention \happenedBesides/ the above things, I lost at the same time a very valuable, and uncommon Circumferentor \Theodilate/ calculated
[253]
not only for Superficial Measure, but for taking of Altitudes, and other useful purposes which I carried out solely for the Publick use \Service/ imagining it \might be/ necessary for laying of \out/ Grounds for Fortins &ca;4 I also lost many other things wch I sd have receivd, and shd have mentiond in a Publick way \These things I should have mentioned/ upon my first comg in had I not been Sensible that the Gentn were pretty much pesterd \but I found the Committee were surrounded/ with complaints of this sort from several \a similar nature from most/ of the Officers, whose losses, tho I knew \them to be/ were greatly inferiour to mine, yet I also knew they were less able to bear them, & this motive alone prevented me from mentg any thing relating to myself on this hd till now, when \before/ I hope you will be kind enough to serve me. \now./
I am just ready to embark a 2d time in the Service of my Country; to merit whose regard \approbation/ & esteem, is the sole motive that enduces me to make this Campaigne; for I can very truely say I have no views, either of profitting \by it/ or rising5 in the Service as I go a Volunteer witht illegible of Pay, & am certain it is not in Genl Braddocks power to give a Comn that I wd accept; nay I might further addthat so far from being serviceable, I am thoroughly convinced it will prove very detrimental to my private Affairs, as I shall leave a Family scarcely Settled, & in gt disorder; but however prejudicial this may be, it shall not stop me from goingA happy Issue to all your resolves is most sincerely wishd by Sir Yr most Obt Servt
