The said Edd Voilett is to get some honest Neighbour of good Character to see his Corn Measured at Lofting time, and after setting a part such and so much as will serve the several uses of the Plantation to pass his receipt for the remainder and become answerable for the forthcoming of it after making the proper allowance for shrinkage he is also to keep the Key of the Corn houses, delivering out the same with the greatest frugality.

themselves in debauching sober and welinclined Persons the said Edd Voilett doth promise as well for his own sake As his employers to avoid them as he ought; attending closely to his business and follow all such directions as he may from time to time receive from the said George Washington.
