To Mr Gist.
[Winchester, 10 October 1755]



Before I got to Williamsburgh, the Commissions were chiefly disposed of;1 yet having you strongly in my mind (which occasioned an earnest solicitation) I succeeded in procuring the only Commission that was vacant, i.e. to be Captain of a Company of Scouts. This is attended with equal Honour, Rank and Profit, with the other Captains; but will be accompanied with more Fatigue; which you will not regard, as you are greatly inured to it. It is intended, that your Company shall consist as
[99]
much of active Woodsmen, capable of something adequate to your names; I must therefore desire you will Repair immediately thither,2 in order to receive Money and Instructions to Recruit them; and you may be assured, that I shall Endeavour to provide for your Son in the same Company.3
I doubt not but you have heard of the Ravages committed by our inhuman Foes, on the back inhabitants; I am now upon my march against them, with full hopes, that I shall be able to get Satisfaction for their cruel Barbarities.
Never were Indians more wanted than at this time; I have therefore sent to Montour, inviting him, and all he can bringand should be glad that you would come that way, and use all your interest (as I know you have much with him) to engage his comingI will promise if he brings many, to do something handsome for himYou had better be silent on this head, though; least where you are, measures may be taken by the Pennsylvanians, to prevent him from bringing any IndiansI am &c.

G:W.
