Dr Sir.
Dumfries Feby 8th 1775.



I have recievd your favor, and shall punctually attend to the contents;1 I have givn the Gentlemen notice to pay in their subscriptions to Mr Carr, which I am confident will be done in a few days; and of which I will further inform you at Fairfax Court.
The colours drums &c. have come safe to hand by Capt. Coburn; I shall be obligd to you to send the bill of costs, that Mr Carr who has made a present of them to the company may have an oppertunity of paying for them. We have seen the gun sent from Philada, about which there are different opinions; it is however altogether submitted to you, to have the others made in whatever manner you judge most suitable.2 I am with great respect yr Most Obedt Servt
