The Inclosd new Watch Key, is one of the 3 wch were sent me last year by Webster & Son in consequence of my desiring them to be very neat1the other two are exactly like it, & chargd at 1/6 each, when I could have bought as many as I pleasd in the Shops here (rather neater) at 6d. or 7 a piece this Cy. I again wish to have two very different from this Common sortto be of the size of the old one, & one of them to work like it, the other
[68]
as the new one; but both to be of the best kind, & much handsomer and neater than either.2
