Camp at Fort Cumberd abt 9 Thursday NightJuly 13th 1758



Abt 4 Oclock this Afternoonafter I had closd my Letter to youI receivd Information that two Men were killd & a third taken Prisoner on the Road about a Mile from this place. I got the Indians to go, and sent a Command of 50 Men immediately to the spot, where they took the Tract of Six Indians and followd them till near dark when the Indians returnd, as did our Party also.1
They discoverd that one of the Men killd was a Soldr of the
[283]
Second Regiment, and that the other two were herds going to our Grass Guard in the most careless, stragling manner; contrary to repeated, and positive Orders given to prevent small parties stragling from Camp.2
The Mischief was done abt 8 this morningour discovery of it too late to give us a chance to overtake the Enemy3I thought it advisable nevertheless to give you Intelligence that the Enemy are about, and that I expect we shall be pesterd with their Parties all this Moonhaunting our Camps, & watching our Motions.
I have apprizd Colo. Mercer, Captn Dagworthy, and all our out Parties of this murder, that they may be strictly upon their Guard Marchg& vigilant in their Camps.
