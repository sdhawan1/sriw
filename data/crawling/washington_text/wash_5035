Sir.
Fort George [N.Y.] 6th May. 1776



I arrived at this place the 4th Instant and have since been detaind by bad weather and contrary winds. Greatons Pattersons and Bonds Regiments have been gone from here some daysGreatons and Pattersons have left Ticonderoga and I expect Bonds will be also gone from there, before Poors can reach that placeI hope to set out Tomorrow-morning with the last of my party, and expect in ten days to be in or near Quebec.
General Schuyler does every thing. Indeed much more than I thot was in the power of Man to do in forwarding the Troops and provisionsA number of Poors Regiment and six or seven Men of Capn Nelsons Company have deserted on the march.1 I am Yr Excellencys Most obedt Hble Servt
