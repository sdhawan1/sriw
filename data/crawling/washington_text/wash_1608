I had last night a Letter from the General, who is, thank God, better than he has been for Six Weeks.2 Nothing will prevent his journey, but his extreme Weakness; he proposes to Set out to morrow from Shippensburg.
I went Saturday to the Top of the Allegheny Hill where I had the Satisfaction to See a very good Road. 20 loaded Waggons went up without doubling their Teams: and proceeded as far as Edmunds Swamp: To morrow the Road will be cut 3 miles beyond Kickeny Pawlins, Remains 13 to Loyal Hannon.
