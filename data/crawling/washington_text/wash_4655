Sir
Northampton [Mass.] Febry 18th 1776



May I venture once more to trespass upon your Excellencys Patience,1 what I should not do, but from the most urgent Motives, (to procure myself some Money a Commodity, which I never before knew the want off,) & which cannot possibly be done but by my going to Providence, where I have a Friend, who for my Note of Hand will supply me.
[338]
I hope your Excellency will condescend to grant this Request, no doubt your Excellency is sensible, it must be very disagreable to be a Prisoner, but to want the only Means, of rendering our Situation a little comfortable, must afford a very gloomy Prospect.
I flatter myself your Excellency will consider my Rank in Life, & not refuse, what cannot be of any Detriment to the Colonies. I need therefore only add (should your Excellency do me the Honour to comply) how punctuall I shall be, to any Time that may be allotted me, to transact my Business; as well as sensible of your Excellencys kind Indulgence.2 I have the Honour to subscribe myself Yr Excellencys most obedient, humble Servant,

H. E. Stanhope
