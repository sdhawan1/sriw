Dear Sir
Fort Loudoun Novr 25th 1757



The dissagreeable news I recd by Jenkins, of the Increase of your disorder, is real concern to meI had been flatering my self with the Pleasant hope of seeing you here again soonthinking that the change of Air, with the quiet Situation of Mount Vernonwould have been a Speedy means of your recoveryhowever as your disorder hath been of long Standing, and hath corrupted the whole mass of Bloodit will require some time for to remove the causeAnd I hope by the Assistance of God and the requesite care, that will be taken of you, where you now are: that tho. your disorder may reduce you to the lowest ebb; yet you will in a short time get the better of itAnd render your friends here happy, by having the honour of serving once more under your CommandAs nothing is more conducive to a Speedy recovery, than a tranquill easy mind, Accompanied with a good flow of SpiritsI would beg of you; not, as a Physician; but as a real friend who has your Speedy recovery Sincerely at heart; that you will keep up your Spirits, and not allow your mind to be disturbed, with any part of Publick bussiness; that perhaps may not be going on so well, as your concern for the Publick could wishAny little step of this kind, that might happen, would be triffling to the Neglect of yourselfThe fate of your Friends and Country are in a manner dependent upon your recoveryAnd as I am sensible of the regard you have for both, I make no doubt, but that you will use every endeavour that will be in the least conducive to your recovery so that both may still rejoice in the Enjoyment of youI am very much Surprised at Doctr Browns Neglect in not coming

to see you, I cannot see how he can Account for itI wish Doctr Jameson could be got, I have a great oppinion of his judgement and I realy beleive he would be of Service to you.1
Collo. Stanwix I am informd is to continue in Winter Quarters at LancasterIf it is agreeable to you, I should be glad of your permission to go there, in order to see my Cousin Captn StewartThe Sick in the Hospitall are very few at present, which emboldens me to apply for leave2As reading & writing must be very troublesome to you in your present Circumstance, I shall only Pray God, who is the best of all Physicians, that he in his infinite mercy, may restore you, to your wonted health, and preserve you in the Command which is so agreeable to many, and none more so, than to him, who has the honour, to subscribe himself with the greatest Duty & Esteem Dr Sir Your Most Affe & Devoted huml.
