My Dear Sir
[c.6 May 1761]



Yesterday about noon we arrivd at this place where the loss of some Waggon Horses, want of Provisions for the Waggoners, and Forrage for the Horses obligd me to remain last night, I this morning sent to Reconnoitre Cedar Creek which is found immensely swelld by the heavy Rains and deemd impassable so that we are likely to remain here at least for this Day.1
I flatter myself that the Success of your excursion yesterday was such as to make up in some measure for the disagreeable Ride you must have had, I need not tell you how happy a Line from you after the Election is over2 would make me, and when you get to Mount Vernon I beg youll be so good as to offer my Respectfull Complemts in the warmest and most obliging Terms to Your Lady and my hearty Thank for her highly valued presentMay Heaven Bless You with everything you desire or wish & be assurd that I am and ever shall remain with
[42]
the most unalterable Esteem & Supreme Regard My Dear Colonel Your Most Affecte & most Obliged hble Servt

Robert Stewart
