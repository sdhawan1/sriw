Sir,
[Fort Loudoun, 25 June 1757]



I have sent the enclosed to Colonel Lee, open to you, that you may peruse it, and afterwards transmit it immediately to him.
[259]
As I have many Expresses to dispatch, I am puzzled to procure Horses for that service. I send you enclosed, letters for the County Lieutenants of Stafford and Spotsylvania, which I must desire you will forward with the utmost expedition;1 as it may be the means of preventing a great deal of trouble to them, and a heavy expence to the country. I am &c.

G:W.
