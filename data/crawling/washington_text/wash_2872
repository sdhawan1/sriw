Sir
Above is the prices current here at this time, if you incline to ship any thing this way I will endeavor to get the highest price going at the time I receive them. you must note that if we sell for ready money dollars pass at six shillings & what we contract for payable at the Courts in Williamsburg is received at the weight if in silver or gold. we have no encouraging markets Just now either from the Eastward or West Indies but hope the adventurers will not lose.1 I am Yr Most Hble Servt
