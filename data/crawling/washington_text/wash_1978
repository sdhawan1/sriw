My Dear Colo.
Winchester 12th March 1761



Agreeable to your desire I send you Inclosd a List of such things as the Regiment is most and in immediate want off,1 I could not get an accot of their cost, but it may be known from the Commissioners for exaiming the Regimental accots who no doubt are possd of the original accots Colo. Byrd gave in2 I likewise transmit you my Sentiments on the affairs we talkd off at parting, which I fear youll think are exprest with more Zeal and freedom than Judgement and discretion.3
On my return here I talkd over the several things you mentiond to me with our particular Freinds, and Craik Woodrow and Jacob Hight makes an excursion to the lower part of the County tomorrow S[tephen]s continues indefaticable and Im informd intends to make use of every method to arrive at his point de vue but nothing can raise the most remote suspicion of your Interests being immutably Establishd4I wish Colo. Byrd was here5I shall be impatient till I have the pleasure of a Line from you & am unalterably my Dear Colo. yours most affectly

Robert Stewart
