To Robt Orme Esqr. Aid de Camp\Wills Creek/Dear Sir
[Claibornes Ferry, 22 May 1755]



In pursuance of His Excellencys Commands,1 I proceeded to this place with all convenient dispatch; But, as I apprehd, and very justly \Truely/, that the getting and posting Horses at proper Stages, in order to expedate my return, woud occasion some delay I dispatchd an express from Winchester to Hampton advising Colo. Hunter of my business, and desiring him to meet me in Williamsburg with the money:2 which sd express I t\T/his day met \I met the Express/ on his return from there, with a verbal message from Govr Dinwiddie informing me that Colo. Hunter set out to the Northward last Week for money, and wont\ud not/ be returnd in \less than/ 14 or 15 Days;3 & that my journey will prove abortive: \in all probability would be fruitless:/ however this may happen \be/, I shall Continue down \on/ till I have \other/ information;4 but thought it first expedient (as I compleatly believe the report myself \myself/) to give you this\e/ early\iest/ intelligence \notice of it/ that the Genl may determine \take his measures/ accordingly.
As I am fatiegued and a good deal disordered by constant riding (in a droughth that has almost destroyd this part of the Country)5 I shall proceed more slowly back, unless I am fortunate enough, contrary to expectation, to receive the money, and in that case I shall hurry back with the utmost dispatch.
[287]
If His Excellency finds it necessary that the money must \shoud/ be had, he has nothing more to do than intimate the same to me; when I shall return back from any place that an express can meet me with his Orders. My Compts attds Morris,6 Shirley and other Friends of our Party in Camp. I am Dr Sir Yrs &ca
