To Captain Christopher Gist. of a Company of Scouts.
[Winchester, 31 December 1755]



You are hereby ordered to proceed to those public Places where you have the greatest probability of success; and continue Recruiting until the first day of March; at which time it is expected you will repair to this place.
You are, with some trusty person, to send your Recruits here, so soon as you raise a squad of five or ten men; and the person with whom you entrust them, is to take a receipt from the Officer, who will be appointed here to receive them, for the number delivered, specifying their names, &c.
You are to enlist no Servants nor Apprentices; nor are you to discharge any man after he is duly enlisted, upon any pretence whatsoever: neither are you invested with power to impress Horses, &c. as had been practised hitherto, without leave. In all other respects, you are to govern yourself strictly by your General Instructions.
[248]
You may dispose of your Subalterns as seems best to you, for the Service; giving them the same Orders you receive. Given &c. at Winchester December 31st 1755.
