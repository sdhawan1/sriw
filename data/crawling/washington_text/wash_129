To Robert Orme Esqr. aid de Camp to the \His Exy/ General\B. Williamsburgh/ In answer to the foregoing
[243]
Sir,
[Mount Vernon, 15 March 1755]



I was not favourd with your agreeable \polite/ Letter (of the \Inst un/ 2d) till Yesterday; acquainting me with the notice his Excellency \Genl/ is pleased \Braddock/ to honour me with, by kindly desireing my Company in \inviting me to become one of/ his Family. \the ensuing campayn/ Its \is/ true Sir \that/ I have, ever since I declind a \my late/ command in this Service, expressd an Inclination to \serve/ erasure t \t/he1 Ensueing Campaigne as a Volunteer;2 and this \inclination/ believe me, Sir, is not a little encreasd since its \is/ likely to be conducted by a Gentleman of the Generals great, good Character \Experience./:
But, beside\s/ this, and the laudable desire I may have to serve (with my poor \best/ abilitys) my King & Country, I must be ingenuous enough to confess \, that/ I am not a little biassd by selfish, and sinister views \consideratns./t \T/o be \ex/ plain, Sir, I wish for nothing more earnestly, than to attain a small degree of \some/ knowledge i \o/n the Military Art \Profession/: and, believeing a more favourable oppertunity cannot be wishd \offer/, than \to/ serving \e/ under a Gentleman of his Excellencys known \Generl Braddocks/ ability \ies/ and experience, it \does as you may rea/ erasure sonably3 imagine \suppose/, not a little contribute to influence me in my choice.
But Sir, as I have taken the liberty so far, to discourse thus \to express my sentimts so/
[244]
freely, I shall beg your Indulgence yet a little longer, while I say \add/, that the only bar that \which/ can check me in the pursuit of these my desires \is object/, is the inconveniences that must necessarily arise, as \result from,/ some proceedings in a late space(I mean \wch happend a little/ before the \the/ Generals arrival) had \& wch/, in some measure \had/ abated the edge \ardour/ of my Intentions \desires/ and determined me to lead a life of greater inactivity, and \retirement/ into which I was just entering at no small expence; the business whereof must greatly suffer in my absence \when your favor was presented to me/.4 \But, as/ I shall do myself the pleasure \honor/ of waiting upon his Excellency so \as/ soon as I hear of his arrival at Alexandria5 (and woud sooner, was I certain where \to find him,/) till which, I shall decline saying \any thing/ further on this head \till then/; begging youll be kind enough \will be pleased/ to assure \him/ erasure that I shall always retain a grateful Sense of the favour he was kindly \with which he is/ pleasd to offer me \honor me;/, and that I shoud have embraced this oppertunity of writing to him, had I not some little time ago wrote \recently addressed/ a congratulatory Letter \to him/ on his safe arrival \in this Country I/ &ca, and as I flatter myself you will favour me in \making a/ communicating my \on of these/ Sentiments herein, it will need no other mentn or repetition.6
You do me a singular favour in proposing an acquaintance, which \It/ cannot but be attended with the most agreeable Intimacy on my side \flattering prospect of intimacy on my part/; as you may already experience \perceive/ by the familiarity
[245]
and freedom with which I now assume to treat you \enter upon this corrispondence/; a freedom, which, \even if it is disagreeable you must/ erasure7 excuse, as I shall \may/ lay the whole blame \of it/ at your door for encourageing me to throw of the formality \that restraint/ which otherwise might have appeard \been more obvious/ in my deportmt on this \such an/ occasion. The hope of shortly seeing you will be an ex[c]use for my not adding more than that I shall endeavour to approve myself worthy \of/ your friendship, and that I beg to be esteemd Your most Obedient Servant

Go: Washington
