Winter Hill, 29 November 1775. Recommends discharge for Ens. Zebulon Drew, who has been for a Long Time Troubled with a painful Disorder which not only prevents him from Doing Duty at present
[458]
but renders it impossible for him to do any further Service during the Campaign & very Improbable whether he will Ever be able to Serve in the field in future.1
