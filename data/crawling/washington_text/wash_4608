this Camp as expeditiously as possibleIf they belong to the Colony I will take them on the Continents Account, and pay for them, or replace the powder if that shall be thought more advisable, as soon as I have an opportunity of doing it, which I hope will not be longIf to private Gentlemen, I shall be much obliged by your friendly exertions that I may have itI should not have made this application, did not the present state of matters call for all that can be collected, and have not the least doubt of your best endeavours for its being complied with.1 I am Sir with much esteem & regard Your most obedt humle Servant
