Dear Sir,
Mount Vernon October 21st 1771.



Your favour of the 18th of August, never came to my hands till about the middle of this month.1 In answer to it, I shall beg leave to observe that, the Township containd in the Plat you sent me, includes more Land than I shoud choose, or that would be convenient for me to purchase; and I suppose by your laying the Grant off in that manner, and offering me a Lott, instead of 15,000 acres which I proposed to buy, that you do not incline to sell less in a parcel, for which reason I must decline the purchase altogether, unless I can get some person to join me, and at present I know of none that chooses to be concerned; but as I am going to Williamsburg in a few days, it is possible I may meet with some Gentlemen there who may incline to engage in this Scheme, in which case, I will write to you by the first opportunity after my return, and let you know more of my Sentiments on the subject of your offer, than at present I am able to do; in the mean while I have only to request that you may not disappoint yourself of a Bargain on my account.
I am much obliged to you for your kind assurances in favour of Captn Crawford, & shall add nothing more at present than that I am with very great esteem Dr Sir Your mo: Obt hble Servt

G: Washington
