Sir
Norwich [Conn.] April 21, 1776



Agreable to your Excellencys Instructions I tarried at Cambridge till all the Ordnance & Stores in my department were on the way to this place, which to my great mortification was not till the 14th instantThe detention was owing to the Zeal of the General Assembly which promisd more than their activity could perform1In my passing thro Providence Governor Cook & a number of the principal people were very pressing
[102]
for me to take Newport in my way, in order to mark out some works of Defence for that place. The spirited Conduct of the Colony troops posted there in driving away the Kings Ships alarmd the whole Colony for the safety of Its Capital[.] Knowing your Excellencys anxiety for the preservation of every part of the Continent I conceivd it to be my duty to act in conformity to your wishes, especially as I could get to Norwich as soon as the stores which sat out for norwich on the 14th: Accordingly I went to Newport and markd out five Batteries which from the advantageous situation of the Ground must when executed render the harbour exceedingly secureIn this I humbly hope for your Excellencys approbation.2
Mr Cheever as3 expected is this day arrivd In with the powder & some Stores being the last division which I shall endevor to get away as soon as possible & if the Wind shall be fair I propose going by water, if not by LandLt Colo. Burbeck declind complying with your Excellencys orders alledging that the province had settld on him 4/ Sterlg  day during Life after the war was over, which if he went out of the Province he might perhaps lose4Lt Colo. Mason who came with the Ordnance to this Town being in ill health I have permit to go by LandI am going down to Admiral Hopkins to receive his directions concerning the safety of sending out the stores, as some of the Kings Ships Yesterday chasd in A Vessell to New Londonand also to endevor to get the brass mortars which he brought from [New] Providence if not particularly appropriated. I sincerely wish Your Excellency every earthly blessing and am with the greatest Respect Your Excellencys Most ObDt & Most Humble Servant
