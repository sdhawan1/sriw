Sir
Camp at Cambridge Augt 10: 1775



Your Favor of the 2d Inst. is duly received,1 but it is out of my Power to Comply with the Request it contains, of forwarding Commissions. All those I have yet received from the Honble Continental Congress, are far short of the Number required in this Army: for which Reason when at New York, & by Letter from this, I directed Genl Schuyler to apply to the
[284]
Congress at Phila. for those of his Department, as the shortest & easiest ModeTo which I must also now refer you.2
We have had no Occurrence in the Camp for several Days worthy of Notice: But by some Advices from Boston, & several concurring Circumstances; we have great Reason to suspect a Part or the whole of the ministerial Troops are about to remove: New York is the Place generally talkd of as their Destination: I give you the Intelligence as it came to me, but do not vouch for its Authenticity.3 I am with the most respectful Regards to yourself & the Body over whom you preside Sir, Your most Obedt & very Hbble Servt

Go: Washington
