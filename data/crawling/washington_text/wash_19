Sir
May 20th 1752



I shoud have been down long before this but my business in Frederick detaind me somewhat longer than I expected and imediately upon my return from thence I was taken with a Violent Pleurisie which has reduced me very low but purpose as soon as I recover my strength to wait on Miss Betcy,1 in hopes of a revocation of the former, cruel sentence, and see if I can meet with any alteration in my favour. I have inclosd a letter to her which i shoud be much obligd to you for the dilivery of it. I have nothing to add but my best respects to your good Lady2 and Family and that I am Sir Yr most Obedient Hble Servt

G. Washington
