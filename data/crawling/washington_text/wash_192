To Warner Lewis Esqr.\Gloucester Cty/Dear Sir
[Mount Vernon, 14 August 1755]



After returning the \you my/ most sincere, and grateful thanks for your kind condolance on my late indisposition; and for the too generous, and give me leave further to say, partial opinion you have entertaind of my \military/ abilitys; I must express my concern for not having it in my power to meet you, and other Friends, who have signified their desire of seeing me (in Williamsburg). Your Letter only came to hand at nine last Night,1 and you inform me of \that/ the Assembly \will/ breaking up the latter end of the Week, which allows a time too short to perform a journey of 160 miles distance particularly \especially/ by a person in my weak and feeble condition \for/ altho I am happily recoverd from the \disorder which brought me to so/ low \an/ ebb to wch I was reduced, by a sickness of near 5 Weeks contin[uanc]e \yet, my strength is not returnd to me/. Had I got timely notice, I woud have attempted the ride by slow and easy journeys, if it had been only for the satisfaction of seeing my Friends, who I flatter myself from what you say, are kind enough to sympathise in my good, and evil Fortunes.
The Chief Reason (next to indisposition) that prevd me from coming down this Assembly was a determination not to offer my self \Services/ and that determination proceeded from the following
[361]
Reasons 1st a belief that I coud not get a command upon such terms as I shoud care \incline/ to accept, as \for/ I must confess \to you/ I never will quit my Family, injure my Fortune, and (above all) impair my health to run the risque of such Changes and Viscissitudes as I have done \met with/; but shall now expect if I am employd again, to have something certain. Again, was I to have \accept/ the command, I shoud insist upon somethings which ignorance and inexperience made me overlook before, particularly that of having the Officers in some measure appointed with my advice, and with my concurrance; for I must say \add/, I think a commanding Officer not havg this liberty appears to me to be one of the \a/ strangest things in Life, when it is well known \considered/ how much the conduct and bravery of an Officer influences the Men; how much a Commanding Officer is answerable for the behaviour of the inferiour Officers; and how much his good or ill success in time of action depends upon the conduct of each particular Officer \one/; especially \too/ in this kind of Fighting, where being dispersd, each and every of them at that immediate time, has greater liberty to misbehave than if they were regularly, and compactly drawn up under the Eyes of their superior Officers. Then, On the other hand, how little credit is given to a Commander who perhaps after a defeat, in relating the cause \of it/ justly lays the blame on some individual whose cowardly behavr betrayd the whole to ruin; how little does the World consider the Circumstances, and how apt are mankind to level their vindictive Censures against the unfortunate Chief, who perhaps merited least of the blame.2 Does it not appear then that the appointing of Officers is a thing of the utmost consequence; a thing that shoud require the greatest circumspectionOught it to be left to blind chance? or what is still worse, to a forcd partiality? Shoud it not
[362]
be left to a Man whose powers \life/ and what is still dearer, whose honour depends upon their good Examples. \behaviour./3
There are necessary Officers yet wanting, which no Provison have\s/ been made forA small Military Chest is so absolutely necessary, that it is impossible to do without nor no Man can conduct an affair of this kind that has it not. These things I shoud expect, was I \if the/ appointed. \ment fell upon me./
But besides all these, I had other Reasons whh withd me fr. offering \my Services/I believe our Circumstances are illegible \brought/ to that unhappy Dilemma that no Man can gain any Honour by conductg our Forces at this time; but \will/ rather loose in his reputation \if he attempts it/; for I am very confidt the progress \of military movements/ must be slow for want of conveniences to transport our Provisions \ammunition & Stores/ &ca over the Mountains, and this chiefly occasiond \in a great measure/ by the late ill treatmt of the Waggoners & Horse drivers, who have recd little \compensatn/ for their Labr and nothg for their lost Horss. & Wagns,4 wch will be an infallible means of preventg all from assistg that are not obligd \compelled/; so that I am truely \fully/ sensible, whoever undertakes \this command/ it will meet with such insurmountable obstacles that he will be soon lookd upon in the very light of \viewed in the light of/ an idle indolent body, have his conduct censurd \criticised/, and perhaps meet \perhaps/ with approbious abuse, when it is \may be/ as much out of his power to avoid these delays as \it would be/ to comd the ragg Seas in a Storm. Seeing \Viewing/ these things in the above
[363]
light that I did\o/, had\s/ no small influence upon me, as I was pretty well assurd \am very apprehensive/ I shoud loose what at present constitutes the chief part of my happiness, i. e. the esteem and notice the Country has been pleasd to honour me with.
It is possible you may infer from what I have said that my intentions is to decline at all events, but my meaning is entirely different \not so/: I was \am/ determind not to offer, because to sollicit the Command, and at the same time to make my proposals, I thought woud look \be/ a little incongruous, and to carry\ing with it/ a face of too much self sufficiency as if I imagind there were not others equally, (if not more) capable of conducting the affair than myself; But if the command shoud be offerd, the case is then alterd, as I am \shd be/ at liberty to make such objections as my Reason and my small experience have\d/ pointed out: I hope youll make my Compts to all inquiring FdsI am Dr Warner Yr most Affe Friend and Obt Servt
