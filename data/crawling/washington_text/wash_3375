Dear Sir
Norfolk March 14th 1775



I am truely concerned to find myself under a Necessity to depart from Virginia without the Pleasure of having paid my Respects at Mount Vernon, which was one of the principal Objects I had in View leaving Boston, my only possible Attempts being frustrated by the pressing Necessity of a Friend, with whom I
[302]
travelled, to return to James River sooner than I intended. When I shall again have a Chance for this Honour depends upon Events too intricate to foresee at present, tho I anxiously hope they will terminate so favorably as to allow me a longer Indulgence in the Course of next Year.1 In the mean Time I beg you will accept this as an Assurance of the permanent Respect and best Wishes of, Dr Sir your most obedient and most humble Servant

Robert Mackenzie
