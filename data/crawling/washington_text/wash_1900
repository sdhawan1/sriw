My Dear Sir
Williamsbg March 8th 1760



With a heart that overflows with Gratitude I return my most unfeignd thanks for that fresh mark of your true Friendship and Noble generosity to me, so amply evincd in yours of the 20th Ulto which I yesterday had the infinite pleasure of receiving,1 But I should never forgive myself if I should by making use of your uncommon goodness, in the least degree embarrass, much less cause a material disappointment in the prosecution of your affairs, therefore my dear Sir let me entreat you not to think of being off any Bargain or do anything that might cause the most distant risque of a Bills returning, for I solemnly declare it would give me much more uneasiness to be instrumental in occasioning either, than to continue a Sub[altern] for everbesides theres but a very small chance for my procuring a Purchass supposing me possessed of never so much Money2 another reason is that by a Memorial we have given into the Assembly (which is referrd to the next Session) we have great room to hope that we will when reducd receive Half Pay or an equivalent to it3 these reasons added to the strong Attachment I have to this Colony which a number of concurring circumstances obliges me to Love, has determind me to apply for Leave to Sell out, or, if that cant be obtaind to Resign.
The Assembly has voted Twenty thousand Pounds to support the Regt till next November and 300 Men till the following April if the Governor should Judge it necessary to keep up that Numr,4 Its said the Assembly will rise in 4 or 5 days5We have no other News of any kind here that can merit your notice and as the Bearer (who assures me you will receive this in 3 Days) is just setting out have only Time to beg you that you will be so good as to render my Respectfull & most obliging Complemts acceptable to your Lady and be assurd that I am & ever will be With the warmest and most Gratefull sense of your vast Friendship My Dear Colo. Your Most Affecte & Most Obliged hble Servt
