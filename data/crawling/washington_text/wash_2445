Dear Sir,
Caroline, July 15th 1768



I have just Time to put a Cover over The Enclosed, & to add to the Informa[tio]n I suppose Mastr Custis himself has given You, that He has enjoyd perfect Health ever since You left Him,1 exceptg two or three Days that He complaind of a Pain in his Stomach, which I at first took for the Cholic, but since think it more likely that it might be owing to Worms. As it easily went off, by two or three Medicines I gave Him, and as He has had no Returns, I did not think it necessary to consult Dr Mercer; which however I shall immediately do if You desire it.2
You will oblige us by looking into yr Books for a work of Ciceros, De officiis, or his Familiar Epistles& mutilated Livy: & sending Them down by the first Opportunity that offers.3
Be so obliging to Me as to excuse the Shortness of this Letterit shall not be long, ere I will write to You more fullyThe Messenger, who is to carry This to the office, now waits for Me. I am, very respectfully, yr most Obedt Hble Servt

Jona[tha]n Boucher
