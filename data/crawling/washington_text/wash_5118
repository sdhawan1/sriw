Sir
New York May 17. 1776



I received your favor of the 6 Inst. & am of Opinion as you have not a sufficient number of Armourers at Albany to repair the whole of the Arms in your possession that whatever more you have than can be repaired in a Conven[ien]t time, had better be sent immediately to the Armourers hereThis will save much time which woud be lost were the Armourers to goe from hence & return again. I am &c.

G.W.
