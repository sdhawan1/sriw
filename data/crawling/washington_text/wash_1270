His Education seems to have been a Good Country Education he writes a Good hand & is Accquainted with figures. his Courage We beleive is indisputable, His Conduct as farr as We can Judge from many Months Observation is faultless. he was made a Sergt when forces were first levied in this Collony, in which Station he has servd with Vigilence & Obedience ever Since. By Majr Lewiss Order he has acted as Commissary for near a twelve Month, as he understands there are some Vacancies at present, And as it is not without president he hopes You will remember him which we beg leave to inforce, as he had some expectancy before.
