Yr Letter without Date I recd1 am sorry You have occasion to complain for want of Flouer &ca it gives me much Uneasiness, & have wrote strongly to Majr Carlyle to prevent any such Complaints for the Future, & I hope You will have no room to complain for the want of Provisions or Ammunition having desired that the last may be immediately sent out. Before this reaches You I doubt not Colo. Innes will be with You, who has my full Instructs. for conducting the Expedition, & a regulatn in regard to the Comdrs of the Independt Compas. which I hope will prevent any murmuring in regard to rank.2
I wish You had suspended going to Red Stone Creek, till You was joined by the other Forces, being much affraid of a Surprize; You know the French act with great Secrecy & Cunning, & therefore I do not doubt You will be on Yr GuardI shall be glad Mr Perroney be appointed Adjutant, I have left the Appointmts to Colo. Innes & on Yr Applicatn I dare say he will appoint him;3 & regulate the Affairs in regard to the regulars working on the roads building Forts &caI am excessively hurried with Affairs of great Consequence, that I cannot answer Yr Letter fully, but be always assured that I have a true regard for Yr Merit & good Conduct, & I shall be very carefull in representing the same when I have the opportunity of serving You. I refer You to Colo. Innes, who no doubt will consult with You in most Things.
I have orderd two Hogsheads of rum out, & when in want desire Colo. Innes to write to Majr Carlyle for more. I am with Esteem & respect Sr Yr Friend & humble Servt
