To Ensign Hubbard. Commanding at Enocks-Fort. Sir,
[Winchester, 21 April 1756]



You are hereby desired if possible, to retreat with what men and provision you have to Edwardss; and to Escort what families have put themselves under your protection. But if you find this impracticable without a reinforcement, on your applying to Captain Harrison at Edwardss, a Detachment will be sent to assist you. You are not to fail in bringing off all the Stores you can. I am &c.

G:W.
April 21st 1756.
