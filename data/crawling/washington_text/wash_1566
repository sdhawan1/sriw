It gives me great Concern to acquaint you that Liut. Lawson & two men of your Regiment are down in the Small poxIt first discoverd it self yesterday,1 when I immediatly Set about Building an Hospital at a distance from Camp to receve the Infectedand reconnoitred ground for a New Camp for the Virginians, which is to be movd to day 2 miles S.E. of this PlaceAll the men taken with the disease shall be movd to the Hospital immediatly where they will have a particular guard of men who have had the Small Pox; a Docr & Nurses to Stay with them, without any Correspondence with us. I am in hopes that in a fortnight, following this method the disease will disappearI would advise you to have Capt. Flemings Company in camp by them selves, least they Should have Carryd the Infection to Fort Cumberland.2
