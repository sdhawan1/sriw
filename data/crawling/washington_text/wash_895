Sir
Philada Augt 19. 1756



I have your Favours of July 23. and Aug. 3but that you mention to have wrote  Mr Balfour, is not come to hand.1 I forwarded the Pacquet inclosd in that of July 23. as directed; & shall readily take care of any other Letters from or for you, that pass thro my hands.2
The Post between this Place & Winchester was established for the Accomodation of the Army chiefly, by a Vote of our Assembly; they are not willing to continue the Charge, and it must I believe be dropt, unless your Assembly & that of Maryland will contribute to support it, which perhaps is scarce to be expected. I am sorry it should be laid down as I shall my self be a Loser in the Affair of Newspapers: But the Letters  Post, by no means defray the Expence. If you can prevail with your Assembly to pay the Rider from Winchester to Carlisle, I will endeavour to perswade ours to continue Paying the Rider from Carlisle
[364]
hither: My Agreement with the House was, to carry all publick Dispatches gratis; to keep Acct of Postage receivd for private Letters; charge the Expence of Riders & Offices, and they were to pay the Ballance.3 I am, Sir, with great Esteem & Respect, Your most obedient humble Servant

B. Franklin
