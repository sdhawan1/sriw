To Major David Lewis. of the Albemarle Militia, at Millers Fort.Sir,
[Fort Dinwiddie, 18 October 1756]



Lieutenant Bullet, who commands at this place in the absence of Captain Hogg, tells me, that he applied to you for a few men to join such parties as this Garrison can afford, to range the woods, and assist the inhabitants in securing their Grain, gathering their Corn, &c. and that you have refused to aid him. I conceive if you did so, it must have proceeded from a misapprehension of his meaningTherefore I apply to you myself on this head; and desire your compliance, or reasons for refusing.
I presume, Sir, it will be needless to acquaint you, your own good sense will doubtless evince it; that the intent of sending men hither was to protect the frontier inhabitants; and offer them comfort, by relieving their distresses, and wants; which [will] not in any wise be accomplished, while you remain in a body at a certain place, forted in, as if to defend yourselves were the sole end of your coming.
You will I hope excuse the liberty I have taken in mentioning this affair, when I tell you I am in a very great measure authorized by the Governor to direct in these matters. I am &c.

G:W.
