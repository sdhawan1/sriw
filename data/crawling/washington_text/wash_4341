May it please your Excellency
[c.16 December 1775]



I trust to your Excellencys well known Character to pardon a Stranger & Inferiorwho presumes to address you on a matter of Consequence to himself, tho perhaps of very little to you[.] I
[560]
woud then Inform your Excelly that not long Since I was recommended to Brigadr Genl Spencer for a first Leiutenancy, by Col. Reed, and his other field Officers,1 which was agreeable to the Captain under whom I was to Serveto which Brigdr Genl Spencer objected, only on account of my not belonging to the Army, and its being inconsistant with General Orders, for Brigadr Genls to give their Approbation of any Person for a Commission, who was not already engagd in the Service2I have a peculiar fondness for serving in the Continental Army, and shall think myself highly honourd, shoud your Excely think me deserving a Commission. I am Sir with the highest respect and Esteem yr Excelly most Obedient humbl. Servt

Stephen Keyes
