As we are naturaly desirous to give our Friends the earliest notice of our Scituation we have, by permission of the Committee of safety wrote to them, which Letters I take the Liberty to enclose to you, with one for Genl Gage & another to Major Campbell who commands the 22d Regiment,2 to which I belong, open for your perusal, when I request they may be sent to General Gage in order to their being forwarded. I have the Honor to be Sir, your most obedient and most humble Servant
