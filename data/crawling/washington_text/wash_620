Dear Sir
Wmsburg 26th[27] April 1756



I recd your Favor with the enclosd Estimate of your present Corps and proposd Regulation for 2000 Men to be formd into two Battalions. Those I have talkt with Seem to approve of the Scheme and wish it may be Effected.1 The Proceedings below Stairs2 go on slowly notwithstanding on hearing of the many and repeated Invasions of our Enemys, They appear alarmd and are for immediate Dispatch, Yet a few Hours lull their Fears and alls well again. I hope You will receive this under the Escort and Convoy of our Cherokee and Nottoway Indians under the Care of Majr Andw Lewis When being joynd You and known abroad to be under yr Command will be a great Checque to the French and their Indians.3 In the Account given of Captn John Mercers Defeat, I suspect the Indians who are Swift on Foot drew our unwary People by a pretended Flight into an Ambuscade. Our Agent Mr Abercrombie writes, that the Lord Lowden & his Kinsman Colo. Abercrombie were namd for the Command of the several Forces to be employd in No. America and three Regiments to be Embarqud with Them, but their long tarrying gives too great an Advantage to the Enemy who are dayly projecting and doing Us manifold Mischiefs.4 No Advances yet in the Ho. of B. relating to yours and Officers Memorial5A long Sessions but little of Importance done. In the Genl Court a Judgment is obtaind for your late Brother agt Keyes who on pressing Solicitation is allowd Six Months for Payment;6 also agt Colo. Lomax who flatters himself with the Prospect of great Wealth from his Share of a Copper Mine given Him and Colo. Chiswell by Colo. Joshua Fry which has a Show of much rich Ore.7
