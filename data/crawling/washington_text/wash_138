I have had the misfortune to loose 3 of my Horses since I left home;1 and not bringing money enough to buy others, and to answer all contingent \the contingent/ expences that may arise in the course of the Campaigne, I have made bold to sollicit your Lordships assistance; \the granting of/ which, will infinitely oblige me.
About 40 or 50 will supply my wants, and for which \this sum/ I sh\w/oud gladly pay your Lordship Interest, beside many thanks for the favour, as I am greatly distressd \disconcerted/ at this present, not being able to proceed well witht \conveniently without such aid./.2
The Genl sets out to morrow, and proceeds directly to Wills Creek;3 which, together with the hurry of Business, thats \has/ happend since we came to Town \this place/, has been a means of depriving me of the pleasure of waiting upon your Lordship, as I intended to have doneplease to make my Compts to Colo. Martin.4 I am Yr Lordships most Obedt & most Humble Servt
