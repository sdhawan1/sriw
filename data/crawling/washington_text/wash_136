It will be needless to expatiate \dwell/ on the pleasures that a communication \corrispondence/ of this kind will \would/ afford me, as it shall \let it/ suffice to saya corrispondance with my Friends is the greatest satisfaction I expect to enjoy, in the course of the Campaigne, and that none of my Friends are able to convey more real delight than you areto whom \from none shall I derive such satisfaction as from yoursfor to you/ I stand indebted for so many \many/ Obligations.
If an old Proverb can claim my belief, I am \will apply to my case I shall/ certainly \close/ erasure est share of \with/ successfor surely no Man ever \could have/ made a worse beginning than I have \done/: out of 4 Horses which we \I/ brought from home, one was \I have/ killd outright, and the other 3 \are/ renderd unfit for use;1 so that I have been detaind here three days already, and how much longer I may continue to be so, erasure the Womb of time must \only can/ discover.2
