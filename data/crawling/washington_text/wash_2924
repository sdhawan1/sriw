John Harper who is in partnership with William HartshorneJohn Harper comes down in order to see the Country, if he likes it, they propose to come down and settle with you; they are Men that have a very pretty InterestWm Hartshorne lived with me some TimeThey are Industrious, Careful, Sober Men;1 If Capt. Harper should want to draw on this place for Five hundred Pounds I will engage his Bills shall be paidAny Civilitys shewn him will be returnd by Thy Friend
