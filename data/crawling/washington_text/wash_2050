I must Confess its a Price that our markett wont Admitt of for them. Consequently so long as you Can make that money of them there I cant expect you Should favor me wth any Share thereof. they formerly would have fetched as much or more money than any Tobo I imported; but for the last Two years I had them their Quallity was quite different. for a fine dry Stout Clean well Scented Tobo noted for Pipeing to a Clamey soft tender Tobo & of wch I did write Mr Valentine. the hhd you so much complain of  the Everton1 I do Assure you was a poor tender Tobo made up wth apart Stript leafe wc. was another disadvantage to its SaleI Should take it as a perticular favour If you would Indulge me wth the Consigt of a Single Ton more of it by way of once more trying our Markett2 & if it be but of its fine light Chesnut Colour Stout dry & Clean I dont doubt but I could make you an aGreeable Sale that DPC was one famous in every Shop in Our Town & Neghbourd & it would give me great Pleasure to See it so again.
