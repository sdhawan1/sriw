Sir
Lisbon [Portugal] 26 June 1765



We had the pleasure to write you the 7th Ulto advising the state of our market relative to Corn, since which being without any of your favors will occasion brevity.1
We have had some refreshing showers lately, which has been of great Service to the young Crop, but all accounts agree that the harvest will not be so abundant, but that supplys will be wanted towards Winter, therefore if you are inclined to speculate therein we think a Cargo of good sound dry Wheat, free from dust or Seed, will turn to good account about 8ber or later Flour is selling at 2400 rs2  Quint[al], on account some parcells lately arrived, but we dare say will support; herewith a price Current for your perusall3 and not having to Enlarge We Remain with Sincere Regard Sir your most hum. Serts
