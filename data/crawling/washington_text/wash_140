To Mrs Washington\near Fredericksbg1/Honourd Madam
[Winchester, 6 May 1755]



I came to this place last Saturday,2 and shall set out to morrow with the General for Wills Creek; where I fear we shall wait some time for a sufficient number of Waggons to transport us \our Provns Baggage &ca/ over the Mountains.
I am very happy in the Generals Family, as I am \being/ treated with a complaisant Freedom which is quite agreeable; so that I \to me &/ have no reason to doubt the satisfaction I proposd \hoped for/, in making the Campaigne.3
As we have met with nothing yet worth relating I shall only
[269]
beg my Love to my Brothers and Sisters;4 and Compliments to Friends. I am Honourd Madam Yr most Dutiful & Obedt Son

Go: Washington
Winchester May 6th 1755
