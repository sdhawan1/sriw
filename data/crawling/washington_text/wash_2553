Wm & Mary Decr 21. 1769



I am much obligd to you for the clear Account you have been pleasd to send me to Day concerning the Lands to be surveyd.
I dare say you will agree with me in Opinion that it is for the
[282]
Honor of the College as well as the Interest of the Officers & Soldiers, that (to use the Words of the Council) a Person properly qualifyd to survey those Lands be appointed by us[]1I have no Doubt of Mr Crawfords being such as you have mentiond, & I beg Leave to assure you very sincerely that this my first Duty to the College being satisfied, I shall be happy in the Opportunity of shewing due Respect to the Advice of the Honble The Governor & Council, & of properly Regarding Col: Washingtons Recommendation.
I have communicated to Mr Johnson my Sentiments on this Subject, & I believe his agree very much with mineMr Camm is not in Town & I imagine we shall not be collected again till after the Holy Days2I am of Opinion it woud be adviseable for Mr Crawford to be here as soon as possible, I mean with his own Convenience, as I see no Impediment to retard or prevent his Success.3 I can, Sir, say no more with Propriety, & therefore I am sure you will not expect more than this. I have the Honor to be with great Respect Your very Humble Sert
