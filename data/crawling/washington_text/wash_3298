The gentlemen of the company return their thanks to you for your kind offer, and will be much obligd to you, to write to Philada for forty muskets with bayonets, Cartouch boxes, or Pouches, and slings, to be made in such a manner, as you shall

think proper to direct; I have not sent the subscription paper, but think I can venture to assure you, that the gunsmith who undertakes the business, will be paid on demand, as the subscribers are jointly & severally responsible for the whole, among whom there are a number of respectable gentlemen: Mr Robert Graham, who conveys this to you has promisd to lodge yr letter in the Post Ofice in Colchester this evening, that no time may be lost.2 I am with great respect Yr Most Obedt Servt
