Revd Sir
Williamsburg June 2d [9] 1770



Your favour of the 21st Ulto containing very judicious remarks on the advantages of Travelling (to youth who have a turn to Improvement) served to convince me of the Utility of the measure. but when I came to converse with sevl Gentlemen who have had some experience of the expence, and of whose judgments I entertaind a better opinion of than my own, I find myself embarrassed; Not because I have met with any, who think the measure a bad one, or who disapprove of your Plan; but on Acct of the expence: being assured that not less than fifteen or 1600 pr Ann. (as he Jacky woud set out with a charge of 500) woud be sufficient to defray his expences; which Sum, as it woud exceed his Income, & consequently break in upon the Capitol, might be deemd Imprudent in me to allow, without the Sanction of the Court: who are the constitutional Guardians of Orphans, & before whom, all Accts of this Nature are to be passedThese opinions corrisponding so exactly with the doubts I expressed to you in a former Letter, obliges me to add, that I am sorry it is not in my power to give you a definitive answer on this head, at this time. But be assured, that if it can be accomplishd in such a manner as to exculpate me, & without too great a load of expense, it will always meet with my ready & hearty concurrance.
