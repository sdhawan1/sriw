Fort Dunmore [Pa.] may 28th, 1774



The infinate confusion into which this country mutilated by our disagreement with the indians, has heretofore put it oumutilated power to continue a desirable correspondence with you, but amutilated importance of the Subject urges, and your interest may be parmutilated Servicable; together with the pleasure I feel in maintaining an mutilatedctive intercourse with you, I snatch this moment to write mutilated.
I have acquainted his Excellency Lord dunmore mutilated my Oppinion of matters here, in a concise manner; and oftmutilated which I judgd necessary towards the advantage of this promismutilated Settlement; & in order to evince the propriety of my argument mutilated transmited a Coppy of my Journal Since the begining of oumutilated with the natives, which I apprehend his Lordship will lay mutilated the Honourable House.
The Shawanese (Sir) have long since looked upon mutilated Commencing Settlements down the Ohio with a most jealmutilated and have Frequently expressd their disapprobationas they mutilated Remarkable for a haughty, violent & unthinking tribe; they mutilated latterly committed many Robberies & Murders upon different mutilated going down the River, and their impertinent answer to oumutilatedlence message sent to them by the Delawares in consequenmutilated what had happened to their people; together with their dirmutilatedperations for open Hostillities convinces me that chastisemutilated will ever prevail upon them to admit of a peacable Sitmutilated at the Kanhawa1If the Government means to encourage mutilatedration down this River, so much coveted by people in Genmutilated Stockade Fort at the Kanhawa is absolutely necessary to prmutilated adventurers & prevent the Frequent interuptions to the cultivmutilated the country, which otherwise inevitably will be the case mutilated distance from the Kanhawa across to the Kiscapoux Shawmutilated2 is but inconsidarable it will constantly overawe them, wmutilated that from thence, inroads may be expeditiously made into mutilated Country, & every purpose we may desire effectually accommutilated as to the expence, I humbly presume it will be but Trifling for the Garrison might be defended by the Militia of the country who

would undoubtedly fly there on every emergencyI also conceive (Sir) that mutilated Shawanese ought upon this occasion to be throughly chastised and convincd mutilated their insignifacancy, which will in the first place prove exemplary to mutilated contiguous Neighbours, and in the next place it will clearly point to mutilated that half doing matters of this nature with Indians can never answer any Salutary purpose, for, had the Shawanese been so much under our Power as the Delawars were, when Col: Bouquet marched into mutilatedcountry, their Language would not have been So haughty to day, but on the contrary would have been consonant to the tone of their more peacable neighbours.3 as I expect nothing but a war with them so i flatter myself they may be convinced to their Sorrow, that their Rashness will Serve to punish them in drawing our just Resentment upon them, I have sence the Begining of this dispute worked with never ceasing hurry at mutilated place & now have it in a good posture of defence, so that for this spot, I fear mutilatedthing, but my heart melts for the distress of the people, who fly, in dismutilated, abandoning all their promising hopesWe have great numbers mutilated here, and I do Every thing in my Power to Comfort them, but the mutilatedssing difficultys under which we Labour prevent me from giving mutilated the aid and comfort I could wish to afford. I have drawn together mutilated day one Hundred active men & ordered them to march down to wheeling mutilated Keeping near the River, so that they might be enabled to discover any mutilatedts leading into the country, and I am in Great hopes they may mutilatednately met Some of the Shawanese parties and defeat them, for mutilated the first impression made, greatly depends our Success towards a mutilatedy accommodation with the other Nations;4 a hint of which I gave all mutilated Officers of militiaI cannot conclude without assuring you that mutilated Government of Virginia having taken place at this critical mutilated has been the Sole preservative of the country, otherwise I mutilated imagine the whole Settlement must have been abandoned. I am with much Regard Dr Sir Your most Obedt Servt.
