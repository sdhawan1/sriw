Good Couz.
Stratford [by Bow nigh London]5th of Septr 1755.



It is a Sensible Pleasure to me to hear that you have behaved yourself with such a Martial Spirit in all your Engagements with the French Nigh Ohio. Go on as you have begun; and God prosper you.
We have heard of General Bradocks Defeat. Every Body Blames his Rash Conduct.
Every body Commends the Courage of the Virginians and Carolina men: which is very Agreable to me.1
I desire you, as you may from time to time have opportunity, to give me a Short Account how you proceed. As I am your Mothers Brother, I hope you Cant deny my Request.
There is Little News here. One of our Men of War has taken in our Channell a French Ship of 16. Guns, 2. Brigs, and a Schooner, bound2 for Martinico, and brought them in. And
[16]
there were 11. more in the Fleet; after which another Man of War is gone out in Chace.
What will be done with them 4. that are taken I Cant tell.
There is no war Declared yet Either by the French or us; though it is expected there Soon will.
The King is not Returned from Hanover yet; but is lookt for very soon: The yachts are gone for him. I heartily wish you Good Success, and am Yr Loving Uncle
