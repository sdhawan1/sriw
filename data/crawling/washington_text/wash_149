To Jno. Hunter Esqr.\Hampton/Sir
[Winchester, 16 May 1755]



I have Orders from the Genl,1 and \Instructions from/ Mr Johnston,2 \the Dy Paymaster Genl/ to receive 4,000s Sterg at the rate of 4.0.7 pr Oz.;3 which will \they say/ suffice for the present contingencies. I have therefore dispatchd this express, with orders to make all imaginable haste to you, who I am told will imediately repair to Wmsburg with the money, and pay it there, according to contract.4 I must beg your utmost diligence in this affair as I have Orders not to wait, because
[285]
the whole Army will halt at Wills Creek till I return, at an immense expence.
I have Letters from the Genl and Paymaster, with Bills and proper Instructions; all of which I shall deliver when I have the pleasure of meeting you, which \& this/ I expect will be (in Williamsburg)5 on Wednesday next,6 as I am now upon my way down, and shall delay no time. I am &ca \on the journey./
