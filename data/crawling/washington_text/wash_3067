I have also to thank you for your care of the Goods brought in by Captn Cox & sent round by Daugherty, they came very safe to hand and I have to request the favour of you when you see Captn Cox next to make my Complimts to him at the sametime you inform him of the safe arrival of these things & assure him if he should ever come to Potomack again (as he seems to expect) that I shall always be glad to see him at this House.1
I have not been unmindful of my promise in respect to the Fish Ho. before the next Season I shall have one erected for your accomn not doubting but it may turn out to both our advantages.
