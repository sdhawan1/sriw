To Captain Bosumwith, of the Royal American Regiments at York.Sir,
[Fort Loudoun, 8 December 1756]



I am informed you have enlisted one Patrick Murphy a Deserter from my Regiment who was confined in the Goal at York, tho you had previous knowledge of his being so.1 You must be sensible such proceedings are repugnant to the public interest, and contrary to established articles of war; to say nothing of the ill effects that follow precedents of this nature. The suspicion of a Soldiers disloyalty, I shoud have thought sufficient to suspend your desire of recruiting him, until confirmed of the truth: and as you then refused to give him up to a Sergeant sent on purpose to receive him: and now assured of his belonging to
[46]
my Regiment; I hope you will take the first opportunity of returning him to his company at maidstone (under command of Capt. Robert Stewart:) It being impracticable to send so far as Philadelphia for him. Your compliance will oblige Sir Yours &c.

G:W.
Fort Loudon, 8th of Decem. 1756.
