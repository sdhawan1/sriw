To Mr Walkeror Person acting in his Place1Sir
[Fort Cumberland, 2 September 1758]



Colonel Bouquet desires 100 Waggons, if possible, may be Engagd in Virginia; and, that as many of them as can, may be sent to this place loaded with Flour, & the remainder with Indian Corn (Oats I suppose will do)where they will receive further Orders.
I beg you will, therefore, use your utmost diligence to Comply with this request; and let me know also, immediately, how far you think you shall be able to comply with itfirst in regard to the no. of Waggons, next the qty of Flour & Corn; & lastly, what time you think they may be got to this place. Such Waggons as cannot get Loads, must come up empty.
You must not expect an Escort from henceI shall certainly be Marchd before you can need one. you must therefore apply to His Lordshp who I flatter myself will Order you one from
[445]
the Militia, or from Captn Rutherfords Rangers, if they can be spard2I am Sir, Yr Most Obedt Servt

Go: Washington
