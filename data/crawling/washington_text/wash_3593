I beg the favour of you to make a tender of my best respects to your honourable board & do me the justice to believe that I am Gentn Yr Most Obedt & MostH. Ser.

P.S. There are now at this place two or three Surgeons from Philadelphia, very powerfully recommended to me by some of the Delegates of the Continental Congress to be provided for; if you should want such, & will signify the same I will inform them thereofthey are strangers to me, but have the appearance of Gentlemen & strongly recommended as men of knowledge in their profession.2 Yrs &ca
