Sir
Plymouth [Mass.] 29 Novr 1775



This pr Capt. Martindales Lieutenant,1 who comes to acquaint your Excellency, that the people on board the Brigantine Washington are in general discontented, & have agreed to do no Duty on board sd Vessel, & Say, that they Inlisted to Serve in the Army & not as Marines.
I believe Capt. Martindale has done all in his power to make things easyHis people really appear to me to be a sett of the most unprincipled, abandond fellows I ever sawyour Excellency knows in what manner to conduct in this matterI am very apprehensive that little is to be expected from Fellows drawn promiscuously from the army for this Business, but that if people were Inlisted for the purpose of privateering much might be expected from them.2
I have just heard that Capt. Coit is at Barnstabledriven in there by two men of WarrHe has sent an express to your Excellency, but I had not the pleasure of seeing him when he passed thro this Town.3 I am your Excellencys most obedient much Obligd Humb. Servant

William Watson
