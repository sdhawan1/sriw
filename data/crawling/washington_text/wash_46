Honble Sir
Little Meadows [Md.] 9th of May 1754



I acquainted your Honour by Mr Ward with the determinations, which we prosecuted in 4 Days after his Departure, as soon as Waggons arrived to convey our Provisions.1 The want of proper Conveyances has much retarded this Expedition, and at this time, unfortunately delayd the Detachment I have the Honour to commandEven when we came to Wills Ck my disappointments were not less than before, for there I expected to have found a sufficient number of pack Horses provided by Captn Trent conformable to his Promise, Majr Carlyles Letters and my own (that I might prosecute my first intention with
[94]
light expeditious Marches) but instd of tht, there was none in readiness, nor any in expectation, that I could perceive, which reducd me to the necessity of waitg till Waggons cd be procurd from the Branch (40 Miles distant)2 However in the mean time I detachd a party of 60 Men to make and amend the Road, which party since the 25th of Apl, and the main body since the 1st Instt have been laboriously employd, and have got no further than these Meadows abt 20 Miles from the new Store; where we have been two Days making a Bridge across and are not gone yet: The great difficulty and labour that it requires to amend and alter the Roads, prevents our Marchg above 2, 3, or 4 Miles a Day, and I fear (th no diligence shall be neglected) we shall be detaind some considerable time before it can be made good for the Carriages of the Artillery with Colo. Fry.3
We Daily receive Intelligence from Ohio by one or other of the Traders that are continually retreating to the Inhabitants with their Effects; they all concur, that the French are reinforced with 800 Men; and this Day by one Kalender4 I receivd an acct which he sets forth as certain, that there is 600 Men building at the Falls of Ohio, from whence they intd to move up to the lower Shawno Town at the Mouth of Sciodo Ck to Erect other FortressesHe likewise says that these forces at the Forks are Erectg their works with their whole Force, and as he was coming met at Mr Gists new settlemt Monsieur La-Force with 4 Soldrs who under the specious pretence of hunting Deserters were reconnoitreg and discovering the Country.5 He also brings the agreeable news that the Half King has receivd, & is much pleasd with the speech I sent them, and is now upon their March with 50 Men to meet us.
The French down the River are sending presents and invitations to all the neighbouring Indians, and practiseing every means to influence them in their Interest.
We have heard nothing from the Cawtabas or any of the Southern Indians th this is the time we mostly need their assistance I have not above 160 Effective Men with me since Captn Trents have left us, who I dischargd from this Detacht & orderd them to wait your Honours Comds at Captn Trents for I found them rather injurious to the other Men than Serviceable to the Expn till they could be upon the same Establisht with us and come under the rigr of the Martial Law.6 I am Honble Sir
