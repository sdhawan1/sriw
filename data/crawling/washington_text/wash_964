This plan is calculated upon the most moderate and easy terms for sparing the Country expences, and I believe with tolerable justness may answer the design of protecting the inhabitants. It may be objected, that the distance between some of the forts is too small; in answer to which I must observe, they are generally fixed upon the heads of creeks, &c. extending towards the alleghany mountains, with almost inaccessible mountains between them, and are placed in the most commodious manner for securing the inhabitants of such waters. Some Garrisons are larger than others, according as they cover a thick or thin Settlement. The fort at Vasss, (which Capt. Hogg is now building) is in a much exposed gap, subject to the inroads of the southern Indians, and in a manner covers the greatest part of Bedford & HallifaxDickensons is situated for the defence of a once numerous & fertile Settlement, on the Bull Cow & calf-pastures; and lies directly in the Shawnese path to Ohio, and must be a place of rendezvous, if an Expedition is conducted against the Ohio Indians below Du Quesne.1 The Garrisons on the potomack-waters, are yet larger than any; because an invasion is most to be dreaded on this Quarter.
It will be seen Fort Cumberland is not mentioned in this plan. If we act only on the defensive (a System on which this plan is founded) I think it employs a large garrison to very little advantage to Virginia: If we act offensively, it may be of infinite use, if properly fortified; and the Garrison at Cockess, will then only consist of about 50 or 60, as the rest may be removed to Fort Cumberland.
