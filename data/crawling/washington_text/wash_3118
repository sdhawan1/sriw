Dear Sir,
Mount Vernon Feby 15th 1774



Before Mr Beall deliverd me your Letter of the 10th,1 which came to hand later than I expected (under a supposition of his willingness to undertake my business on the Ohio) I had conditionally agreed with Mr Vale Crawford for this purpose; who you must know, had Imbarkd in a Courting Scheme (in this neighbourhood) and, as I conceivd the task of pleasing a Master & Mistress, equal to that of two Masters, I made a point of his settling this business some how or other with the Ladybefore he undertook mine; and this he did unfavourably to his wishes, the very day Mr Beall came here & was at liberty for me.2
I should have mentioned this to you by Mr Beall, but was a good deal hurried just at that time by sevl Persons on business, who chancd to fall in here just as he did. Mrs Washington Desires me to thank you for your kind congratulations on her Sons Marriage; & with Complimts to Mrs, Miss Boucher, & yourself in which we both join, I remn Dr Sir Yr Most Obt

Go: Washington
