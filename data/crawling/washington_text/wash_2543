We have the pleasure to advise the receipt of thy favor of 25th July and note the contentsWe remark thy observation respecting the Balance of thy Account being 7.10.0, and that had
[265]
thee thought of our Debit against thee at the time thee was disposing of thy Tobacco, thee should have orderd one Hhd on board the Hanbury in discharge of it, this we should have been obligd to thee for, but if thee will please to refer to thy Accot Current thee will perceive the Balance is seven Shillings and ten Pence instead of 7.10.0.
Inclosd is a Letter for our friend J.P. Custis directed to thy care, and in future we shall be careful to transmit all our Letters to him in the same manner.1 Having already informd thee of the death of our C. Hanbury, we have only now to observe that the business of the House is continued under the same firm, and that we rely upon a continuance of thy kind friendship and assistance to our Interest, assuring thee our utmost endeavors shall be exerted to merit it.
Capt. Esten again goes in our Ship Hanbury and we hope will meet with a quick dispatch, as his arriving to an early Market will in all probability afford us an Opportunity of returning pleasing Accot SalesWe flatter ourselves thy assistance will greatly contribute towards obtaining this desireable event The prices of Tobacco at this time are from 3 to 3  lb. for Exportation; & from 10 to 11d. for Home Consumption, except the very fine sort which will produce something moreWe shall at all times be glad to hear of thy welfare and remain with great regard Thy assured Friends
