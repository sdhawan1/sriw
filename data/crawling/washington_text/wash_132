To The Honble William Bird Esqr.\Westover/
Honble \Dr/ Sir
[Mount Vernon, 20 April 1755]



I was \am/ sorry it was not in my power to wait upon you at Westover last ChristmasI had enjoyd much real satisfaction even
[250]
in the thought \of doing it/ when an unexpected accident put it intirely out of my power to comply either with my promise, or Inclination; both of which equally urgd \prompted/ me to make the \is/ Visit.1
I am now prepareing for, and shall in a few days sett off, to serve the \in the/ ensueing Campaigne;2 with different views from what \, however, from those/ I had before; for here, if I can gain any credit, or if I am entitled to the least erasure3 \countenance/ and esteem, it must be from serving my Country with a free voluntary will \out fee or rewd/; for I can very truely say I have no expectation of reward but the hope of meriting the love of my Country, and friendly regard of my acquaintances; and as to any prospect \eitherTo merit its esteemand the good will of my friends is the sum of my ambition, having no prospect/ of att\[o]b/aining a Comn, I have none, as I am pretty \being/ well assurd it is not in Genl Braddocks power to give such a\n/ one as I woud accept off; as I am told \The commd of/ a Compa. is the highest Comn that is invested in his gift.4 He \was so obliging as to/ desird\e/ my Company this Campaigne, has honourd me with particular marks of \his/ Esteem, and \has/ kindly envited me into his Family; \a Circumstance/ which will ease me of that expence, which \s that/ otherwise, woud unavoidably \must/ have accrued in furnishing a proper \stores/ Camp Provision \equipage &ca/; whereas the expence \cost/ will now be easy, (comparitively speaking) as baggage Horses, Tents, & some other necessarys will constitute the whole of the charge.5 Tho I mean to say, \Yet,/ to leave a Family just settling, and in the utmost confusion & disorder (as mine is \in/ at present) will be the means of my using my \is not a pleasing thing & may be hurtful/
[251]
private Fortune very greatly, but however this may happen \be this as it may/, it shall be no hindrance to my making this Campaigne. I am Sir with very gt esteem, Your most Obt Servt
