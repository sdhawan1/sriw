Your Letter & Goods by Boyes for our Plantations on York River have come safe to hand as I wish Mrs Dandridges also had done she being a good deal disappointed in having them withheld from her1I must now desire that the Inclosed order may be complied with, & the Goods sent by the first ship bound to York River (chargd to me) still hoping that they may come to hand some time this Fall.2
I have directed Mr Valentine to put all my Tobacco on York River on board of Captn Boyes as also Master Custiss (two Tonn only excepted wch has been delivered to Captn Easton this Month or more)3 & wish he may meet with ready dispatch but fear he will not from what I have heard.
Our Crops on that River were very short last year and on this (Potomack) I did not make one pound of Tobacco. I shall delay writing fully till my Invoices are forwarded & am Gentn Yr Most Obedt Hble Servt

Go: Washington
