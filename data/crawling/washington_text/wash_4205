Tyonderoga [N.Y.] Nov: 22d 1775.



I have the Happiness My Dear General to inclose You a Letter from Colo: Arnold, & a Copy of one of his to General Montgomery, with Copy of that Gentlemans to me;1 Whatever may be Colonel Arnolds Fate at Quebec, his Merit is very great, in marching such a Body of Troops, thro a Country scarcely trodden by Human Foot. May Heaven still continue to smile on our Arms, until We have obtained that Justice, which is so justly our due.
I momently expect a Committee of Congress, the Gentlemen left Philadelphia on the 11st inst.2
I lament that I cannot return any Boats to St Johns, as I am
[418]
left almost alone here, Nothing can surpass the Impatience of the Troops from the New England Colonies, to get to their Fire SidesNear three hundred of them arrived a few Days ago, unable to do any Duty, But as soon as I administred that Grand Specific, a Discharge, they instantly acquired Health & rather than be detained a few Days to cross Lake George, they undertook a March from here of two hundred Miles with the greatest Alacrity.
Our Army requires to be put on quite a different Footing. Gentlemen in Command, find It very disagreeable to Coax, wheedle and even to Lye, to carry on the Service. Habituated to Order, I cannot without the most extreme Pain, see that Disregard of Discipline, Confusion & Inattention which reigns so General in this Quarter, & am therefore determined to retire, of this Resolution I have advised Congress.3 I am Dr Sir with the most unfeigned Sentiments of Esteem & Respect Your Excellencys most Obedt & Most Humble Servt
