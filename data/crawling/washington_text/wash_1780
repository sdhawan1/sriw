I hope Captn Turner who left this Place on Tuesday the 14th, with the provision the assembly made for impowering me to keep the Regiments a Month longer abroad, and 5000 for Pay of the Forces has reachd the Army some Days before the first of December, that the Commander in chief, you, and the rest of the Forces might be fully apprized of the Determination of the assembly before it was too late.1 I have nothing particular to add but my most hearty good wishes for your Success, being with great Regard Sr Yr Very Hum.
