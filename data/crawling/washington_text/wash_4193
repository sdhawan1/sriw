Dear Sir,
Cambridge 20th Novr 1775.



Your Letters of the 4th from New York7th andfrom Philadelphia (the last by Express) are all before me;1 and gave me the pleasure to hear of your happy meeting with Mrs Reed, without any other accident than that of leaving a Horse by the way.
The hint containd in the last of your Letters respecting your continuance in my Family; in other words, your wish that I could dispense with it, gives me painYou already, my dear Sir, know my Sentiments on this matter; you cannot but be sensible of your Importance to me; at the sametime I shall again repeat, what I have observd to you before, that I can never think of promoting my convenience at the expence of your Interest and Inclination; that I feel the want of you, yourself can judge, when I inform you, that, the peculiar situation of Mr Randolphs affairs obliged him to leave this soon after you didthat Mr Baylor, contrary to my expectation, is not, in the smallest degree, a Penman, though Spirited and willing& that Mr Harrison, though sensible, clever, & perfectly confidential, has never yet moved upon so large a Scale as to comprehend at one view, the diversity of matter which comes before me, so as to afford that ready assistance which every Man in my Situation must stand, more or less, in need of. Mr Moylan it is true, is very obliging, he gives me what assistance he can but other business must, necessarily, Deprive me of his aid in a very short time2this is my Situation, judge you therefore how much I wishd for your return, especially as the Armed Vessels, & the capitol change (in the state of this Army) about to take place,
[408]
have added an additional weight to a burthen, before too great for me to stand under, with the smallest degree of comfort to my own feelingsMy Mind is now fully disclosed to you, with this assurance sincerely, & Affectionately accompanying of it, that whilst you are disposed to continue with me, I shall think myself too fortunate, & happy, to wish for a change.
Doctr Morgan (as director of the Hospital) is exceedingly wanted at this place and ought not to delay his departure for the camp a moment, many regulations being delayed, & accts Postpond, till his arrival3I have given G S. and Colo. P a hint of the prevailing reports in Connecticut,4 without intimating from what Quarter they came (for indeed I have recd them through different Channels) in order to put them upon their guardthey both deny the charge, roundly, and wish for an oppertunity of vindicationI thought, as this information had come to my Ears in different ways, it was best to speak to these Gentleman in terms expressive of my abhorance of such conduct, & of the consequences which might flow from it, & think it will have a good effectthe method you have suggested of the advanced pay, I very much approve of, & would adopt, but for the unfortunate crampd state of our Treasury, which keeps us forever under the Hatchespray urge the necessity of this measure to such Members as you may converse with, & the want of Cash to pay the Troops for the Months of Octr & Novr; as also to answer the demands of the ComyQuarter Master& Contingenciesto do all this a considerable Sum will be necessarydo not neglect to put that wheel in motion which is to bring us the Shirts, Medicines, &ca from New Yorkthey are much wanting here, & cannot be had, I should think, upon better terms than on a loan from the best of Kings; so anxiously disposed to promote the welfare of his American Subjects.5
Doctr Church is gone to Govr Trumbull, to be disposed of in a Connecticut Goal without the use of Pen, Ink, & Paper. to be conversd with in the presence of a Magistrate, only, and in the English Languageso much for Indiscretion! the Doctr will say.6 Your Accts of our Dependance, upon the People of Great Britain, I religeously believeit has long been my political Creed, that, the Ministry durst not have gone on as they did, but under the firmest perswasion that the People were with
[409]
themthe Weather has been unfavourable however for the arrival of their Transports, only four Companies of the 17th Regiment and 2 of the Artillery are yet arrived, by our last advices from Boston.7
Our Rascally privateers-men, go on at the old rate, Mutinying if they can not do as they please. those at Plymouth, Beverly, & Portsmouth, have done nothing worth mentioning in the Prize way & no Accts are yet recd from those further Eastward. Arnold, by a Letter which left him the 27th Ulto, had then only got to the Chaudiere Pond, and was scarce of Provisionshis Rear division under the Command of the Noble Colonel Enos, had without his privity or consent left him with 3 Companies and his Expedition (in as much as it is to be apprehended, that Carlton, with the remains of such force as he had been able to raise, wd get into Quebec before him) I fear in a bad wayfor further particulars I refer you to Mr Hancock, who has Inclosed to him Copies of Arnolds & Enoss Letters; the last named Person is not yet arrivd at this Camp.8
I thank you for your frequent mention of Mrs Washington I expect She will be in Philadelphia about the time this Letter may reach you, on her way hither. as she and her Conductor (who I expect will be Mr Custis her Son) are perfect strangers to the Road, the Stages and the proper place to Cross Hudsons River (by all means avoiding New York) I shall be much obliged in your particular Instructions & advice to herI do imagine, as the Roads are bad, & the Weather Cold, her Stages must be short; especially as I expect her Horses will be pretty well fatiegued; as they will, by the time she gets to Philadelphia, have performd a journey of at least 450 Miles. my Express finding of her among her friends near Williamsburg 150 Miles below my own House.
As you have mentioned nothing in yr Letters of the Cannon &ca to be had from N. Y. Ticonderago &ca I have, in order to reduce the matter to a certainty, Imployed Mr Knox to go to those places; compleat our wants, & to provide such Military Stores as St Johns can spare.9 My respectful Compts to Mrs Reed &cabe assurd that I am Dr Sir with Affecte Regard

Go: Washington


Flints are greatly wanted here.10
