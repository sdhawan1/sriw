Dear Sir
Winchester Decr 29th 1758



Your most kind letter I had the great pleasure to receive, and acknowledge my self under new obligations for your repeated offers of friendship. I wish it may ever be in my power to make you a suitable return for such friendship is seldom to be met with in those daysBut to pretend to testifie the just sense I have of your kindnesss would be too troublesome to you, and probably might appear too fullsom. therefore shall only say that they are so great that I shall never be able to repay themBy Mr Boyd I made bold to trouble you with a letter, in which was inclosed a list of Medecines for the use of the Troops1The dissapointment I met with in not getting what I wrote for from Fredricksburg (as they could not be had there) makes it absolutely necessary to dispatch of medecines immediatly for the relief of the sickmany are now suffering & I cannot assist them for want of necessariesThe distruktion of the medicines at Fort Cumberland has been a great misfortune to us2In my
[173]
last to you I mentioned something with regard to myselfWhether or not you thought I had best resign immediatlyIf you think the troops are to take the feild soon, and that it would be an injury to the country (in not allowing them time to provide themselves with another) for me to continue any longerI should be gland you would inform the Govr that I beg leave to resignAnd in case you think this most expedient, I have inclosed a list to Mr Boyd, to give to Doctr Carter for my own use: untill I can be supplyd from home3I hope youl excuse this repeated troubleAnd beleive me to be with the greatest sincerity and Respect Dr Sir Your Most Obliged & Obedt Servt
