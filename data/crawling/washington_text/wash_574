Sir
Joseph Edwardss on Great Cacapon April 17th 1756



Yesterday about seven OClock in the Evening the Waggons arrived here by which I received my Instructions to march to the Warm Spring Mountain, but finding it impracticable to attempt crossing the N. River between this an Enochss Fort, have, by the Approbation of the Officers here halted till the Waters shall fall, Great Cacapon having raised 8 Feet perpendicular since last Night & is still rising very fast.1 Yesterday Morning one of Captn Ashbys Men, who has been on Forlow some Time, with one Hintch who came down with Us as a Pilot, were in their Return to Ashbys Fort & were fired on by seven Indians, Hintch killed dead on the Spot and the other returned here wounded in the Neck, but no ways dangerous2This happend about fourteen Miles from hence in the Road to Parkers Fort,3 I have engaged one of the Country Men to go as a Pilot to the warm Spring Mountain, & coud engage two or three more, to go as Spies who are entirely acquainted with the Woods but seem scrupulous in Crediting the Country, so that an Assumpsit4 from you for their Payment woud make Matters go on chearfully. I am Sir Your very humble Servant
