Dear Colonel
Carlisle [Pa.] 17th August 1773



Such is the uncertainty of human affairs, that I have again the unexpected occasion of giving you a letter on Some business, which if it is to be done at all, it seems must be transacted in your Government.1
Sundry Gentlemen who had formerly held Military Commissions in the Pay of Pennsylvania & Servd in conjunction with the Establishd Troops, have lately fallen upon a method of asking their respective Quotoes of Land (pursuant to his Majestys Proclamation) within the jurisdiction of Virginia, prompted I presume partly by Captn Bullets Advertisement (wch by the by I never well understood) and partly as they inform me by assurances given them by some Gentleman from Virginia whos Name I forget, that Lord Dunmore woud undoubtedly order Patents to all such Officers as Shoud produce Governor Penns Certificate of their Commissions & Service as above;2 In consequence whereof we have Sent off Captn Wm Thompson to attend Captn Bullet at the Mouth of Sioto, who is furnishd with Our Governors Certificate &c. in order to get the Lands Surveyd in that new Country. On the 1st of July Thompson arrivd at
[308]
the mouth of Sioto, but found that Mr Bullet had left that place and was gone quite out of his reach to the Falls or a place calld Bigg-bone-lick not expected to return till Spring or Summer next. This being the Case Captn Thompson writes us, that as the lands are Surveyd on the Front of the River (on the South side) a great distance above & below the mouth of Sioto, he is determind to go back from the River & lay Out & Survey the lands expecting that thro the good Offices of Some Gentlemen of your country, those Surveys to be made for the Officers by him, may be accepted & approvd in the land-office of Virginiaand indeed tis now evident to me, that if this favour cannot be obtaind, we fall through, and shall be Subjected to a considerable loss of expence. having thus Stated the whole as far as I know it & being totally a stranger to the usuage & conduct of your Government, I now on behalf of a great number as well as my Self who always respect your name, beg to be favourd with your advice, whether this thing is practicable, and if you think it is, by what Steps or means you shoud be of Opinion it may best be attaindand to this favour I shoud never doubt the addition of your Salutary influence if at all in your way, or not contrary to yr Judgment. I expect Dr Mercer will either write or wait of you on the same errand of this letter.
Permit me to add, tis very possible Thompson may get nothing done (altho he has about Sixty Men of whom there are several Surveyors in expectation of being deputed by Captn Bullet for the sake of dispatch) as of four Men with ten or twelve Pack Horses which he Sent by land, a3 Set of Villains of the Minggo Tribe for such Im told is their Character has actually killd One or two of the Men & taken all the Horses &c. of which Thompson knew nothing when he wrote.4 Tis also Said they are ill pleasd with Bullets going down the Riverbut the Shawanees at least appear to disapprove the act of the Minggoes mentiond above.5 Time prevents me to add farther, than That I am with perfect respect, Your Most Obt humbe Servant

John Armstrong
