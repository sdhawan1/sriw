Sir,
Mount Vernon, Decr 15th 1773.



Had I not expected to have acknowledged the rect of your obliging favor of Septemr last by the return of Mr Custis1 I shoud not have remained silent till now. The pleasure which I received from your favourable account of this young Gentlemans conduct at College coud only have been increased by his continuance at that place, & in the same pursuitsBut this is at an end, and I am obliged to yield, contrary to my judgement, & much against my wishes, to a kind of necessity, of permitting him, to engage soon in a new scene of Life, which I think he would be much fitter for, some time hence, than now. This being the case, however, I have to thank you for your polite attention to him, whilst in New York, at the same time I inform you that I have requested the favor of Doctr Cooper to reward every
[408]
Gentlen whose attention was bestowd on him, in an ample manner. As Mr Custis will write to you himself by this conveyance, respecting his private concerns in New York, I have no occasion to add anything on that score; but should business or inclination ever bring you to this Government, permit me to say, that I shall think myself very happy in seeing you at this place, being Sir, Your mst Obt humble Servt

G: Washington
