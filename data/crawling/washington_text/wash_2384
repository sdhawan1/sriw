Dear Sir
Carlisle [Pa.]3d Novembr[20 December] 1767



With particular pleasure I acknowlege the receit of your favour of the 21st Septr but know not when it may meet with a Safe conveyance, I shall detain the letter a little, and if none appear, shall risque it by the way of Winchester or Philada.
Your Information that part of the Lands on the Yaughyaughghany & Monongahela formerly conceivd to lie within the bounds of yr Governmt is now likely to fall within the Limits of Pensylvania may I think prove very true; but that part of it that respects the making of Entries or issuing Grants at Carlisle, is entirely vauge & without foundation, that Office being alwais restricted to Philadelphia & kept by the Proprietaries Secretary (at present James Tilghman Esqr.) who in extraordinary Cases consults the Governor & Board of Propertywch Board are only Assistants to the Governor he being Sole Commissioner of Property. nor is the Governor himself as yet by any
[56]
means at Liberty to grant any Lands beyond the Aleghany Mountains until they are first purchasd of the Six-Nation Indians which purchase has been on foot for some time past & its said will be concluded by Sir Wm Johnston this ensuing Spring or Summer, at which time tis also said Sir Wm will make a Purchase on behalf of the Crown, of larger extent than the limits of Pensylvania, perhaps West of Virginia, but of this I have no certainty1so that at present Sir, you may firmly depend that nothing coud be farther attempted than a distant or conditional application to Governor Penn for a Tract or two, on them Waters when the Purchase shall be confirmd, which done in your Polite manner & under good pretentions too, Im persuaded coud give no Offence, nor easily fail of Successand if any Offices of mine either on the present or any other Occasion, may be of the least use I beg you woud freely command them, as they are now tenderd and shall be chearfully employd as often as you shall give me leave. and perhaps on the first opportunity I have of going to Town I may take the Liberty of feelling his Honrs Pulse & at least assist the foundation for any application you may afterwards think proper to make.
As to the mode of taking up or having Lands granted in our Province, it has been considerably loosethe general intention of the Proprietaries has been a Competant Plantation of 2, or 300 to each settler more especially since the Government became populous; but this Rule for various reasons has not been generally adherd to, nor coud it well be, and however just in itself as a general guide, has been much eluded especially of late when the Artifice of borrowing Names, or taking Out Warrants & Orders of Survey in the names of other People as tho they were for their use & afterward procuring conveyances from those whos names they had made use of,2 has so much prevaild that many & not of the most deserving has ingrossd large quantities. this occasiond some noise among the populace, has made the Governor and Agents very uneasy & indeed pr[e]vents the moderate gratification of many deserving persons to whom some distinction is due; for the cry is that we shall have no strong Settlements backward because of those ingrosers. In locating of Lands we generally describe the Spot as nearly as we can, and the Surveys are expected to be made as regular as the nature of the Land will any way admit, that is by a four
[57]
lind figure in order to pr[e]vent Culling, but our Mountanious Country Seldom admits a regular Survey, and the discretion of the Surveyor must take place.
As to the expence of Our Proprietary Lands the terms are now somewhat different from what they have been, 15.10s: Currency consideration Money  hundred acres & One halfpenny Sterling  acre ground Rent per annum, has formerly been the price, but latterly they have fixd the Consideration money per hundred acres only at 5 Sterling & the yearly Quit Rent is raisd to One penny Sterling  acrewhat the Next purchase beyond the Mountains may be I cannot tell but immagin it will be on the terms last describd above, as Landed people seldom come down Stairs, and indeed there are so many desirous of taking up lands, that they know very well their terms will be complyd with tho so distant from trade & other conveniencies of life. In regard to the line now running betwixt us and Maryland3it will very probably be establishd, but that in my opinion, must at least be pronouncd by the Commissioners on each Side the question, or perhaps be confirmd by the Partys on the other Side the Atlantick before it be a final boundary to these provinces, and how far that consideration may happen to retard the grant of Lands near the line may be questionable. I know a Certain Case depending near the line, where neither Province at present, seem willing to assume the Jurisdiction. Im sorry these Subjects had not happend to occur when I last had the pleasure of seeing youbut here permit a Single remark flowing from Old friendship, and it shall be on the infatuating Game of Card-playing, of which on thirty Years observation I am not able even to say so much good, as a witty person Once did of what he Censurd as a Culpable & extravagant piece of Dress that it coverd a multitude of Sins; but that game always unfriendly to Society, turns conversation out of Doors, and curtails our opportunities of mutual good.4 I can easily presume on your good nature to forgive this piece of unfashionable freedom, and Believe me to be with great respect Dear Sir Your Most Obedt And Most humbl. Servt

John Armstrong


P.S. Mrs Armstrong and my Self beg youll please to present our best respects to your Lady & also to yr worthy Neighbours,
[58]
Coll Fairfax & Lady. we have both I hope been betterd by the Warm Springs, except some returns of the Rheumitism that attend Mrs Armstrong, which I apprehend is so constitutional that we can scarcely expect a perfect cure.

We have just recd information that Genrl Gage has wrote Governor Penn, that Sir Wm Johnson apprehends the Indians will break out this ensuing Springand that the Generals letter is conceivd in such terms as has movd the Governor to advise in Council whether the Assembly shoud be calld? but as they Sit early in Janry the Governor has not issud a SummonsMay God avert such a Calamitous Scene; for shoud it happen a third time so near together, Our Frontier People appear to be undone. Capt. Callender has very lately recd a letter from a Trader at the lower Shawna Town, who says that them Indians are at present very quiet, but express some fears of your Government tis also said that Mr Croghan has lately had an amicable interview wth various Tribes at Detroite.5 these last appear to be agst Sir Wms Intelligence.
