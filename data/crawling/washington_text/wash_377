Sir
Winchester 21st Novemr 1755



I arrivd here last night where I found Colo. Stephens, Mr Boyd & Mr Gordon, and as the latter returns immediatly to Fort Cumberland Colo. Stephens thinks it unecessary to send any Express;1 I by Mr Gordon send for Serjt Hughs2 and a return of the Troop, which when recd will transmit  first oppy or by Express if any other Papers should ere then come to hand, theres no Letters but those herewith sent by Colo. Stephens3Im informd that theres no less than six Light Horsemen Deserted & one Dead. The late incursions of the Enemy have struck so great a Panic into the generality of the people in this neighbourghood that Im afraid it will very arduous, if not impracticable to Recruit here[.] All your orders will be punctually obeyd by him who is With due Respect Sir Your Most Obt hble Servt
