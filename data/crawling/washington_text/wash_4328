Sir
Cambridge Decr 14. 1775



The Two french Gentlemen who will appear before you with this, brought recommendations to me from Governor Cooke of Providence, their names are, Messieurs Pennet & Depliurne.1
They propose a plan for supplying this Continent with Arms & Ammunition, which appears to me very eligible, as I am not acquainted with the extent of Schemes already formed by Congress for the attainment of these necessary Articles, I have declined entering into any engagements with them, but have prevailed with them to proceed at the publick expence to philadelphia & there through you to lay their proposals before Congress or a Committee of Congress, to whose attention I beg leave to recommend them & the Important business they come upon.2 I am &c.

P.S. I have given these Gentlemen reason to expect that they can get back to the Cape3 as commodiously & speedily from Philadelphia as they could from Providence, in which I should be very sorry they were disappointed.
