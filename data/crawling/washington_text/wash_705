To Captain Minorof the Fairfax Militia.Sir,
[Winchester, 16 May 1756]



You are immediately, upon receipt of this, with the men under your command, to march to Cockes-Fort, on Pattersons Creek; and there join himYou are to consult with Captain Cocke, and take his directions, in sending out frequent scouting parties, to scour the country, & make discoveries.
It is expected that strict obedience will be paid these Orders; as they are in consequence of a Council of War, which has regulated and appointed the militia to different Stations.
Your Station at this Fort will be more agreeable, as you will have a cover for your men; and be clear of the trouble of procuring provisions.
When you join Captain Cocke, you are to shew him these Orders
[140]
and tell him, that Captain Waggener has Directions to draw out all the Forces but what is just sufficient to defend the place upon any alarm: in order that he may be strong enough to pursue the Enemy. I am &c.

G:W.
