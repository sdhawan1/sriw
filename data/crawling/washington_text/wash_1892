Sir,
Williamsburg Jan. 4. 1760.



I arrived here yesterday & take the first opportunity of writing to thank you & Mrs Washington for the many civilities I received at Mt Vernon.1 It gives me some concern when I consider the obligations I lie under in Virginia to think how I shall be able to return them: indeed I am afraid it will only be in my power to retain a proper sense of them; which I always shall do.
I have the pleasure to acquaint you that your friends in these parts are all well. They inquire after you, particularly the Govr
[381]
and Mrs Fauquier, and seem to regret very much that Mrs Washington & yourself are so far from Williamsburg.
We have little or no newsthere having been no late arrivals either from Engd or the Northward. The Speaker was married I believe last week: on which occasion nothing appeared but youth and gaiety. The new married Couple are now gone to their seat in the country.2 As a counterpart to this, I find that Mrs Burwell of James River was buried a few days ago; that Geo. Braxton has been dying of a pleurisy; but is now something better; I believe out of danger.3 Yr much obliged & humble Servt

A. Burnaby
