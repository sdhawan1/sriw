To Jno. Robinson Esqr. Speaker\of the House of Delegates Virginia1/Dear Sir
[Mount Vernon, 20 April 1755]



I little expected when I wrote you last \that/ I shoud so soon engage
[255]
in another Campaigne;2 but in this I hope \doing it/ I may be allowd to claim some small share of \some/ merit; if it is considerd that the sole motive wch envites me to the Field, is, the laudable desire of servg my Country; and \&/ not for the gratification of any \ambitious or/ lucrative ends \plans./; this, I flatter myself, will manifestly appear by my going a Volunteer, without expectation of reward, or prospect of attaining a Command; as I am confidantly assurd it is not in Genl Braddocks power to give a Comn that I woud accept. Perhaps with \m/any other\s/, the above declaration might be lookd upon as a piece of self sufficient merit; \construed into self applause/ which, being unwilling to loose, I choose to proclaim it myselfbut by you Sir, I hope \expect/ it will be taken \viewed/ in a different light, \because you have/ who seemd to sympathize\d/ in my disappointments, and lent your friendly Aid to reinstate me in a suitable Command; which mark of your approbation was not \The recollection of which can never be/ \/ lost upon one, who is always \a mind that is not in/ sensible off, and \but always/ ready to acknowledge an obligation\s/; and t\T/his is the reason why I am so much more expressive in \unreserved in the expression of/ my Sentiments to you, than I shou\l/d choose to be to the World whose Censures, and Criticisms often place the best \good/ designs in the worst \a bad/ light; and give a different turn to the best of Actions; b\B/ut to be ingenuous, I must confess I had other Intentions in writing \you this letter for,/ and if there is any merit in going out upon such terms as I do \my case/, I was unwilling to loose it
[256]
among my Friends, who \without this exposition of facts might conceive that/ I did not doubt might be made to believe I had some advantageous offers that \had/ engaged my Services, when in reallity it is very [far] from it \the case is otherwise/; \for/ erasure I expe[c]t to be a considerable looser in my private Affairs, by goingIts true, I have been importuned to make this Campaigne by Genl Braddock in \(as a member of/ his Family) who I suppose imagined \conceiving, I suppose, that/ the small knowledge I have (had an oppertunity of acquiring)3 of the Country, Indians, &ca \was/ worthy \of/ his notice; and therefore thought I might \be/ erasure useful \to him in/ erasureing the progress of this Expedition.
Colo. Carter Burwell, the last Assembly, upon hearing that I had lost 50 Odd pounds during my appointt \acting/ as Paymaster desird I wd petition the Committee \of War/ to have it refunded, assurg me at the same time that he woud sollicit the Gentn in my behf \use his endeavors that the matter should be attended to./; I declind it then, thinking it might not be well receivd, as I had been allowd \a/ Comn;4 but if he shoud propose it at a future meeting, and it does not appear to carry \with it the/ a face of unreasonableness, I hope yo. will do me the favour to 2d him5I must own after meeting with the endulgences I did, I shd not have askd this, had it not been proposd by a Member, and had I not been so considerable a looser before in the Service, in loosg many valuable Papers, cloathg, Horses, & sevel other things; some of which, & of no inconsiderable value neither, I card out entirely for the publick use, & forebore meng of it till this \before/ as I knew you were greatly Pesterd with complaints
[257]
of this sort from Officers that were less able to bear them, tho their losses were much more inconsiderable than mine; for I had, unfortunately, got my baggage from Wills Creek but a few days before the Engagemt in wch I also had a valuable Servt Wounded, who died in a few days \soon/ after.6 I thought it expedient just to mention these Facts that you might turn them to any advantage you saw \ee/ proper, or to drop it altogether, if you think it the least unreasonable \the applican is at all improper/. I heartily wish a happy Issue to all your Resolves and am Sir Yr most Obt Servt

Go: Washington
