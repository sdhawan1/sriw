Williamsburg 3d April 1761



Your favour of the 15th Septr, which is the last Letter that I have receivd from you, now lyes before me1By some neglect or other my Bills of Lading for the Tobo pr the Deliverance never came to my hands for which Reason I send you in lieu thereof a Certificate from the Collector of His Majestys Customs of the Tobacco Shipd in that Vessell by me which I am told will answer the same purpose of a Bill.2
Altho you seem to think 40 no large Sum yet I must confess it is in my Estimation rather too much money to looseand I always apprehended that if due caution was observd in the choice of underwriters that losses of this Nature coud scarce ever happen.3
I have been at this place near a fortnight, but dont learn that you have any Ship in the Country wanting Tobo at this timeI shall possibly have an oppertunity of writing to you again before I leave Town in the meanwhile I remain Gentn Yr Most Obedt Hble Servt

Go: Washington
