Sir,
Mount Vernon Feby 28th 1774



I took the liberty before I left Williamsburg (at least the neighbourhood of it, about the 1st of December last) to address a pretty long Letter to Colo. Andw Lewis respecting my Claims under the Proclamation of 17631I also Inclosd him a Survey made by Captn Crawford upon the Great Kanhawa, at the mouth of Cole River, as a Location for the purchase I had made of Mr Thruston, begging him (that is Colo. Lewis) as I had only heard, but was upon no certainty of your being at the Oyer Court (if he thought there was no impropriety in it, and I saw none) to get the favour of you to give me a Certificate of this Survey, that I might, for the Reasons I then gave him, and shall mention to you, obtain a Patent for it immediately;2 The Colo. wrote me that you were obliging enough to promise that, but as the Council came to a Resolution to permit the Officers to Survey their Lands in thousand Acre Lots,3 he thought it might alter my Plans; & therefore returnd the Warrant & Survey Inclosd mutilated me, which for want of oppy I have never had it in my power of sending till now, that it goes by Express in hopes of obtaining such a Certificate for the Secretarys Office, as will enable me to procure my Patent from thence immediately.
The Reasons for my Inclining to take this Land (which I am told is far from being of the first quality) are candidly theseIt lyes in the first place near the bulk of my Land under the Proclamation of 1754; which by being contiguous to my other, can be superintended & managed with greater ease. In the next place, I really do not know where else to locate itand, in the third place, which I may with truth add, is the only reason for wishing for your Certificate by the return of the bearer, I am not without my fears that we may yet meet with some rubs before this matter is finishd, for you must know, that disparing about this time last year of obtaining these Lands in this Government, I commissioned Mr Wood, who was going to West Florida, to locate my quantity there; and that, upon application to the Govr who had not been long from England, he was told that it was Lord Hilsboroughs Instructions,
[501]
or opinion to him that this Bounty was intended to the Regulars only4this, though I consider it in no other light than as one, among many proofs, of that Noblemans Malignant disposition to Americans, & fraught with the most unjustifiable partiality, yet, there is no telling wht may be the result of an enquiry, should Lord Dunmore upon hearing of it, think proper to make oneThis, believe me Sir, as I can see no cause why Americans (who have servd his Majesty in the late War with as much fidelity, & without presumption, with as much Success, as his British Troops) should be stigmatizd, is the only reason for my being sollicitous to obtain my Patent without loss of time, as I can upon my honour assure you, that I believe the Survey is justly & accurately made & will be sworn to at any time, by the Surveyor as he has promisd me to inform you. The Tract indeed, measures 50 acres more than I am entitled to which must not appear in the Certificate, as it will be a bar to the Issuing of the Patent. If therefore it is necessary to reduce the Survey please to strike it of at the upper end of the Tract.
Upon my receiving a Grant of this Land I will pay you the same Fees as if you had actually gone to the spot, & made the Survey; besides acknowledging myself exceedingly obliged to you for the favour of aiding me in the desird dispatch as I receivd my warrants undirected, in order that I might have the greater latitude, this one comes in like manner to you; which you will please to direct when executed, & not before. In order to explain the Reason of this Survey (now Inclosd to you) appearing as part of the 200,000 Acres, I must observe, that some part of the Work being done by Captn Crawford himself, & some by his Deputy, they did not discover that they had, between them, overrun the quantity till after this Survey, & one other opposite to it, on the Kanhawa (which I am now applying for in Botetourt) were made5In short the mistake would not, I believe, have been discoverd at all; if it had not been for me, when I came to compare the different Tracts, in order to the allotment of themthis other Tract, in Botetourt, contains 18 Acres less than 3000; and it is very unlucky for me (as I obtaind my Warrants before the Indulgence of Surveying in 1000 Acre Lots) that I am obliged to send my own Warrant for 5000 to that County, in order to secure that Tract, as I do not
[502]
know where any more Land in that district is to be had; & want to shift the remaining 2000 into Fincastle; which I must yet do, as Captn Bullett has offerd me a Tract Surveyed by him, about twenty odd Miles from the Falls of Ohio, & of from it upon Salt River, Including a Salt Pondthis Tract, thus circumstanced, I beg the favour of you to enter in my name;6 as I will contrive to have mutilatedning part of mutilated Warrent for Botmutilatedpropriated to mutilated purpose. I do not mutilated to be more particular in the Location mutilated Bullet has either neglected to furnish me with mutilated Minute description of the spot, with a Plot mutilated agreeable to his promise, or, his Letter has mutilatedcarried as he agmutilatedd before his Brother mutilated have the Land upon certain conditions mutilated were them concluded uponto the best mutilatedcollection, the above, is the substance of mutilated told me in respect to the situation of this mutilated Pond which he says mutilatedvers a pretty large mutilated of Ground; I beleive mutilatede also said this Tract mutilated Lower down the Ohio than the Falls, as well as a little wide of it, upon the River abovementioned.7 I shall add no more than my hopes of having my business done agreeably to the requests herein containd, and to wish you an agreeable Season for the accomplishment of your business being with very great esteem Dr SirYr Most Obt Hble Servt
