Dear Sir.
Camp at Cambridge September 8th 1775



I have received your Favor of 31st august and am much engaged in sending off the Detachmt under Col: Arnold upon the Plan contained in mine of the 20th Ultimo: A Variety of Obstacles have retarded us since the Express returned with yours of the 27th August from Albany, but we are now in such Forwardness that I expect they will set out by Sunday next at farthest.1 I shall take Care in my Instructions to Colonel Arnold, that in Case there should be a Junction of the Detachment with your army, you shall have no Difficulty in adjusting the Scale of Command.2
[437]
You seem so sensible of the absolute Necessity of preserving the Friendship of the Canadians, that I need say Nothing on that Subject; but that a strict Discipline & punctual Payment for all Necessaries brought to your Camp will be the most certain Means of obtaining so valuable and important an End. I shall inculcate the same principle most strongly on the Troops who go from hence, as that, on which their Safety, Success & Honour intirely depends.3
I am truly concerned that your Supplies and Appointments are so far short of your Expectations, but I trust you will have a feeble Enemy to contend with and a whole Province on your Side; two Circumstances of great Weight in the Scale.
Your Situation for some Time must be so critical and interesting that I hope you will not fail giving me constant Information of your Motions & Success. My best Wishes attend you. Believe me with much Truth and Regard Your most obed: & very humble Servt

Go. Washington
