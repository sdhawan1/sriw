To the Honble Governor FarquierHonble Sir
[Fort Loudoun, 19 June 1758]



The Letter herewith Inclosd, woud have been sent according to the date,1 but I have been waiting till now for Captn Rutherfords Pay Roll, his Company being much dispersd in the Ranging Service.
This day the Prince William Militia are to March for the South Branch, to relieve two Companies of my Regiment, agreable to Orders.2 Inclosd is a return of their present Strength.3 I shoud think myself difficient in my duty were I to pass over in Silence the transactions of and State of this Company from their first coming outabout the 20th Ulto.
One hundred Militia then, were Orderd from Prince William County (but what time I cant exactly say) by Mr President Blair.4 instead of that number they sent 73 and not one of them was provided with either Arms or ammunition, as the Law directs, by which means they were useless, but became instead a illegible burthen to the Country, as they receivd their Allowance of Provisions & had their Pay running on.5 This matter was represented to Colo. Henry Lee, Lieutt of that County, by Sir Jno. St Clair then Commanding Officer here.6 The Consequence of this representation wasthat about the first of this Instt near 100 Arms were sent up, out of which number Scarce 5 were Serviceable; and not more than 30 coud possibly be made to Fire. This was also represented to Colo. Lee, who after confessing a Concern for it, said, they expect Arms from England, (I think) every day, and takes no further Acct of the matter that I have yet heard of. I immediately set Smiths to repairing their arms, and have at last, with the Assistance of 35 old Muskets which I causd to be deliverd out of the Store here, got this Company, which shoud consist of 100 Men (th there is but 68) at last compleated.
Till this time, they have been a dead expence to the Publick, and no Service to the InhabitantsThis Sir, illegible Facts, and really merit reprillegible,7 for if such behaviour is sufferd to escape unnoticed, the most destructive Consequences may accrue to the Country, in the present case for Instance, if the Troops
[230]
had Marchd agreeable to Orders at first Orders, the Companies on the South Branch woud have been drawn off, and the Inhabitants left either destitute of relief, or have come of with them, which they were determined to doThis I understand actually happend in Augusta County when Majr Lewis came from thence, by the negligence, I suppose, of the County LieutenantsI am with due respect Yr Honrs Most Obedt Hble Servt
