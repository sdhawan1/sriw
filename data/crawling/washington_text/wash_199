Dr Sir
Dogues Neck Augt 21st 1755



I fully intended to have waited on You this Evening at Belvoir, but find myself so very unwell after my Ride from Court, that I am not able to stir abroad.
I have taken the Liberty to inclose You two Bills for 300 . . . Ster: drawn by Mr Paymaster Genl Johnston on Colo. Hunter, & an Ordr on Govr Dobbs from his Son for 18.15. Ster: also a Letter for Colo. Hunter, & another for his Honr our Govr. If Colo. Hunter shoud be in Town whilst You stay there, I shoud
[9]
esteem it a particular Favour if Youll be so kind to negotiate the Affair wth Him: it is indifferent to me whether He pays Cash or Bills, pble in London, at the prevailing Exchange at the time: tis probable it may suit Him to take up the Ordr on Govr Dobbs. If You shoud not see Colo. Hunter, please to leave the Bills with Govr Dinwiddie.1
I beg Youll excuse the Trouble I have taken the Liberty to give You on this Occasion, & give Me Leave to assure You that Nothing woud give Me more sensible pleasure than an Opportunity of rendering You any acceptable Service.
I heartily wish You Health & every Felicity, & that You may find the new Regulations in our Military Affairs agreeable to Yr Wishes, & such as will enable you to accept the Command of our Troops with Honour. I am wth my Comps. to all at Belvoir Dr Sir Yr most obdt Hble Sert
