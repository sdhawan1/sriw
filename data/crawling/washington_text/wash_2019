Inclosd we have sent thy Accot Current to 1st Augt lastplease to Examine the same, and not to omit advising us if it proves right, if otherwise please to point out the Error and it shall be rectifyd.1
With concern we remark that it is sometime since we were favourd with any Tobacco from Thee but we hope by Hylton or Esten for a renewal of thy Consignment and in the Sale thereof great Care shall be taken.2
Fine Tobacco that wch is really such is in demand and likely to Continue So, but the price of Midling and ordinary will upon the Arrival of the Fleet be likely to Decline.
No tollerable Judgment can be formd as to Peace or a Continuance of the Warr, sometimes the probabillity of the former is very strong, and perhaps the next Day just the Reverse. We are wth Esteem Thy Assurd Friends

N.B. The Price of Tobo in Genl is now from 3d. to 3d.if very fine will fetch more particularly if Top Stemd.
The proof of Tobacco on board the Deliverance is come to hand & we apprehend will be sufficient but a proof is wantg from an other Person that had Tobo Insured in that Ship before the Case can be adjusted we have wrote sundry times for
[75]
it.3 We have been very careful of what Underwriters we take & have met with as few bad ones as any Person that has had so much to do with them, & if the illegible thee would find it much more difficult then thee art aware of to know Peoples Circumstances.4 Great care shall be taken of the 14 Hhds illegible  the Joseph & if they are JC & in good Condition will sell well.5
