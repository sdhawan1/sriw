The consequences of the Enemys possessing themselves of New York have appeard to me so terrible that I have scarcely been able to sleep from apprehensions on the subjectthese apprehensions daily increaseYou have it in your power at present to prevent this dreadfull eventif I do not mistake, the Congress have given you authority to take any step in that place as well as here which you shall think necessary for the public service, but if They have not given you expressly and literally authority with respect to the City of New York, I am confident that any measure You think right to plan and put in execution will be approvd of1I have the greatest reason to believe from the most authentick intelligence that the best members of the Congress expect that You woud take much upon yourself, as referring evry matter of importance to them is in fact defeating the projectWe have an instance of this in the fate of the motion for seizing the Person of Mr Tryon2To You They look up for decision, by your Conduct They are to be inspird with decisionin fact your situation is such that the salvation of the whole depends on your striking at certain crises, vigorous strokes without previously communicating your intentionon this principle I venture to propose the following scheme and to offer myself for the executionNew York must be securd but it will never I am afraid be securd by direct order of the Congress for obvious reasonsThey find themselves awkwardly situated on this headYou must step in to their reliefI am sensible that no men can be spard from the lines in our present circumstancesbut I woud propose that You shoud detach me into Connecticut and lend your name for collecting a body of VolunteersI am assurd that I shall find no difficulty in assembling a sufficient number for the purposes wanted. this body in conjunction (if there shoud appear occasion to summon them) with the Jersey Regiment under the Command of Lord

Stirling now at Elizabeth Town, will effect the security of New Yorkand the expulsion or suppression of that dangerous banditti of Tories who have appeared in Long Island with the professd intention of acting against the authority of the Congressnot to crush these Serpents before their rattles are grown woud be ruinousI am assurd likewise that the Connecticut Volunteers who will offer themselves for the service will expect no pay, but at most, the expences of their provisions and perhaps of carriages for the Conveyance of their baggage3When once We have securd the place with street fortifications, and engagd the Friends of Liberty so far that They cannot recedepurgd the City and Long Island of the leading Toriesthe residence of these Connecticut Volunteers will be no longer necessary, for there is no reason to doubt that the Congress will detach Troops from Pensylvania to garrison the place although from reasons hinted at They may not chuse to commence the operationthis manauvre I not only think prudent and right but absolutely necessary to our salvation, and if it meets, as I ardently hope it will, with your approbation the sooner it is enterd upon, the betterindeed the delay of a single day may be fatal.4 I am, Dr General Yoursmost respectfully
