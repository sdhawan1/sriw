To Majr Jno. Carlyle\prest at Williamsburgh1/Sir
[Fort Cumberland, Md., 14 May 1755]



I Overtook the General at Frederick Town in Maryld and proceeded with him by way of Winchester to this place; which gave him a good oppertunity to see the absurdity of the Rout, and of Damning it very heartily. Colo. Dunbars Regiment was also obligd to \re/ cross over at Connogogee and come down within 6 Miles of Winchester to take the new Road up, which gave me infinite satisfaction \to Wills Ck wch from the absurdity of it was laughable enough/.2
We are to Halt here till forage can be brought from Philidelphia, which I suppose will introduce the Month of June upon us;3 and then we are to proceed upon our tremendous undertaking of transporting the heavy Artillery over the Mountains, which I believe will compose the greatest difficulty in \of/ the Campaigne;4 for as to any apprehensions of the Enemy I think they need only \are more to/ be provided against, but not \than/ regarded, as I fancy the French will be obligd to draw their force from the Ohio to repel the Attacks in the North, under the command of Governour Shirley &ca, who will make three different attempts imediately.5
I coud wish to hear what the Assembly and others have done, and are doing, together with erasure \such/ \other/ occurances erasure6 \as/ may have happend since my departure.7
I am in very great want of Boots, and have desird my Bror Jno. to purchase a pair and send them to you, who I hope will contrive them to me, by the first oppertunity.8 I have wrote to my old corrispondant Mrs Carlyle9 & must beg my Compliments to my good Friend Dalton, &ca. I am Dr Sir Yr most Hble Servt

Go: Washington
