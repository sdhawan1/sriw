Sir,
Fairfax County Decr 3d 1772.



I have been informd, that a Survey which Captain Crawford made for me on the Ohio (being the first bottom on the So. East side of the river) above Capteening, & nearly opposite to Pipe Creek, at my particular request, you have either gone, or intend to go, & take possession of; Such a step as this, I coud hardly have expected from you However as it is a piece of Land I viewed in Novr 1770 before you had ever explored that Countryhave had it surveyed by an Officer legally appointed by the Surveyor General of this Colony& am resolved to take out a Patent for it (notwithstanding any improvement you either have, or may make upon it,) so soon as Rights are to be had. I have judged it expedient to serve you with this notice thereof, (which I am told is not the first you have had) & to assure you at the same time, that I am determind not to relinquish my right to this Tract, which contains 587 acres, & which I am ready to pay for at any time, till I have at least spent the full value of the Land in support of my claim.1 I am Sir, your humble Servant

G: Washington
