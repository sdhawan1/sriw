My Dear Colonel
[Camp at Fort Cumberland, c.28 July 1758]



If thanks flowing from a heart replete with joy and Gratitude can in any Measure compensate for the fatigue anxiety & Pain you had at my Election be assurd you have them. tis a poor, but I am convincd welcome tribute to a generous Mindsuch, I believe yours to be.
How I shall thank Mrs Wood for her favourable wishes? and how acknowledge my Sense of Obligations to the People in General for their choice of me I am at a loss to resolve onbut whycan I do it more effectually than by making there Interests (as it really is) my own and doing every thing that lyes in my little Power for the Honr and welfare of the CountyI think notand my best endeavours they may always CommandI promise this now, when promises may be regardedbefore they might pass as words of Course.
I am extreme thankly to you & my other friends for entertaining the Freeholders in my nameI hope no exception were taken to any that voted against me but that all were alike treated and all had enough it is what I much desirdmy only fear is that you spent with too sparing a hand.
I dont like to touch upon our Publick Affairs the Prospect is overspread by too many ill to give a favourable Acct. I will therefore say littlebut yet say this, that backwardness appears in all things but the approach of Winterthat joggs on apace.
