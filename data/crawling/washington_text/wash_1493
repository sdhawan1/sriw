Likewise Serves to inform you of the great Drought Since then, that I have not had a Season to Plant one Single Plant. Every thing fit to Burn up with heat if any should offer though late I Shall use my best Industry that Way. The Wheat is now Ripe which Shall be laid up as soon and as Safe as Possible. I am at a loss in regard to the hands after harvest is over if theres no Tobo Made Should be glad of Advice whether to let or Agree with Mr Stephens About them to Cut Wood as I am very Willing to do the best I canI Should be glad to know
