Mount Vernon 17th July 1763.



We were a good deal disappointed in the promised VisitA constant Watch was kept untill the accustomed Bell gave the signal for Dinner, and said it was time to look no moreWe do not readily comprehend the cause of the disappointment, but as Water seems not to be the Element favourable to our wishes,
