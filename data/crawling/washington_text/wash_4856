Sir
Head Quarters Cambridge 1st April 1776



An Express arrived here this Morning with a Letter from Governor Cooke of Rhode Island, of which the inclosed is a Copy.1 In consequence of this important intelligence, I immediately dispatchd an Express after General Sullivan, who is on his March to Norwich with six Regiments and ordered him to
[7]
file off to Providence if he should be so desird by Governor Cooke to whom I have wrote on the Subject.2 General Green was to have marchd this Morning with five more Regiments by way of Providence. I have ordered him to hasten his March for that place, and hope to collect a force there sufficient to prevent the Enemy from effecting their purpose.
Whether this movement be only a feint to draw our attention from their principal Object, or not, is at present impossible to determine. I momently expect further intelligence from Governor CookeIf the Alarm should be well grounded I shall hasten to Providence and make the necessary dispositions for their reception. I beg you to assure the Honorable Congress, I shall exert myself to the utmost to frustrate the designs of the Enemy. I am Sir Your most obedient humble Servant

Go: Washington
