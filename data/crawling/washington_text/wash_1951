For two years past Messrs Cary and Company have sent me a suit of Cloaths of your making, that dont fit me so well as I coud wishthis I attribute to some error in the measure that was sent.
Having now occasion for 4 pair Breeches as underneath (for which Mr Cary will pay you)1 I have sent another measure for them, taken according to directions of a Taylor here: please to cut them out exactly by it, and if any faults shoud appear I will endeavour to point them out in my next to you; be so good therefore to keep the Measureand send me directions how to measure for a Coat. You will please to take notice that the Inclosd measure is the exact size of the Thigh &ca because it was
