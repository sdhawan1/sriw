Sir
Williamsburg June 1st 1756



The Bearer hereof Mr Richd Baker has been very active in getting Men from the Isle of White County & unless he had engagd to go with them none woud have enlisted, his Friends have applied to me for a Commission, which I coud not regularly give, not knowing what Vacancies may be. I therefore take this Method of recommending him to You, & if You can fill up a Vacancy by giving him a Commission, it shall be approvd of by me.1 I remain Sir Your most humble Servt

Robt Dinwiddie
