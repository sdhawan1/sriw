To Major Carlyle\Alexanda/Dear Sir
[Fort Cumberland, Md., 7 June 1755]



I take this oppertunity, as it is the last I can expect before we leave this place, of enquiring after your health, which I hope is greatly amended since I saw you in Williamsburg.1 I have not time, as we are now very much hurried, to communicate very particularly the little News that is stirring in the Camp; from whence, before I arrivd, was Detachd a body of 500 Men under the Command of Major Chapman & the Quarter Master General, who are to prepare the Roads and lay a Deposit of Provisions at the Little Meadows; where they are to Erect some kind of Defensive Work\s/ to secure our convoys. Tomorrow Sir Peter Halkett with the first Brigade \is to/ March off, and abt the Monday following the Genl and the 2d \Brigade/ will move from hence.2 We have no certain accts of the French on \the/ Ohio; but have advises by Letter from Governor Morris \of Pennsylvania/ that a body of three hundd past Oswego, and that a still larger body was hourly expected, so that I apprehend we shall not take possession of Fort Duquisne so quietly as \was/ erasure imagind.3
The Inclosd is to my good Friend Mrs Carlyle,4 who I hope will not suffer our former corrispondance to drop; my sincere wishes and Compliments attends all enquiring Friends; and I am Dr Sir Yr most Obedt Servt
