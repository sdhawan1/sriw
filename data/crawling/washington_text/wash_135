Genl,3 and to stayI fear too long, as our March must be regulated by the slow movements of the Train, which I am sorry to say, I think, will be tedious in advancingvery tedeous indeedanswerable to the expectation \s/ I have long conceivd \predicted/, tho few believd.4
Alexandria has been honourd with 5 Governours in Consultation5A happy \favorable/ presage I hope, not only of the success of this \e/ Expedition, but for our little Town \of the future greatness of this Town/; for surely, such honours must have arisen from \a meeting must have been occasioned by/ the Commodious, and pleasant situation of this \e/ place, the best constitutional qualitys for Popularity, \which prognosticates population/ and \the/ encrease of a (now) flourishing Trade.
I have had the Honour to be introduced to the \several/ Governours; and of being well receivd by them all; especially Mr Shirley, whose Character and appearance has perfectly charmd me, as I think \his/ every word, and every Action discovers something of \in him/ the fine Gentn, and great Politician.6 I heartily wish \the same/ such unanimity \may prevail/ amongst us, as appeard to Reign \exist/ between him and his Assembly; when they, to expidate the Business, and \to/ forward his journey here \hither/, sat till eleven, and twelve oclock at \every/ Nights.7
It will be needless as I know your punctuality requires no repetitions \stimulus/, to remind you of an Affair abt which I wrote sometime agotherefore, I shall only beg my compliments to Mr Nicholas and his Lady,8 and to all Friends who think me worthy of their enquirys. I am Dear Sir Yr most Obedient Servt
