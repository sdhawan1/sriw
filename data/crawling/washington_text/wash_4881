My Dr General
Williamsburg April the 5th 1776



I most sincerely congratulate you, I congratulate the Public on the great and glorious eventyour possession of Bostonit will be a most bright page in the annals of America, and a most abominable black one in those of the Beldam Britaingo on, My Dr General, crown yourself with glory and establish the liberties and lustre of your Country on a foundation more permanent than the Capitol Rockmy situation is just as I expected. I am afraid that I shall make a shabby figure without any real demerits
[43]
of my ownI am like a Dog in a dancing schoolI know not where to turn myself, where to fix myselfthe circumstances of the Country intersected by navigable rivers, the uncertainty of the Enemys designs and motions who can fly in an instant to any spot They chuse with their canvass wings throw me, or woud throw Julius Csar into this inevitable dilemmaI may possibly be in the North, when as Richard says, I shoud serve my Sovereign in the WestI can only act from surmise and have a very good chance of surmising wrongI am sorry to grate your ears with a truth, but must at all events assure you, that the Provincial Congress of N. York are Angels of decision when compard with your Countrymen the Committee of Safety assembled at Williamsburg. Page, Lee, Mercer and Payne are indeed exceptions, but from Pendleton, Bland the Treasurer & Co.libera nos Domine1I shall not trouble you with a detail of the Army, ordinance stores, but compendiously say that the Regiments in general are very compleat in numbers, the Men (those that I have seen) finebut a most horrid deficiency of Armsno intrenching tools, no guns (ltho the Province is pretty well stockd) momutilated servicehad I only eight eighteen Pounders I woud immediately at all events take post on Crany Island, by which measure I shoud drive out the Enemy and exclude em from the finest and most advantageous Port in America2I have orderd with this view the Artificers to work night and dayif I succeed I shall come in for a sprig of lawrelsthis essenstial measure might have been effected long ago, but the same apathy and oblique squinting towards what the milk and water People call reconciliation; the prodigious flattering prospect opend by the appointment of Commissioners were strong arguments against the expence of gun carriages and intrenching tools3but this is not all They have distributed their Troops in so ingeneous a manner, as to render evry active offensive operation impossiblean equal number of their Battalions are stationd on the different necksThey say, very acutely, that as the expence is equal, the security ought to be equal4I cannot help perswading myself that their object will be to take possession of Williamsburgnot only from its tempting advantageous situation commanding in great measure two fine rivers and a Country abundant in all the necessaries for an army; but the possession of the Capital woud

give an air of dignity and decided superiority to their arms, which in this Slave Country where dominion is founded on opinion multilated a circumstance of the utmost importanceperhaps I may be mistakenbut the surmise is not irrational[.] I have calld three Regiments down the Country5You will excuse, My Dr General, the blots and scratches of this letterfor the Post is just going outby the next I will inform You of the steps We have taken for the security of this placeI have been desird to recommend Colonel Grayson as a Man of extraordinary merit He sets out soon to make application to the Congress for an establishment6if We have, as We must, a Continental Hospital in the Southern department Dr McClurg I suppose will be the Man to direct itI need not mention his qualificationsthey are so well known7I beg You will make some body write to me from time to time, indeed I think I may modestly insist on Mr Palfreys Pen being employd often in this serviceadieu, Dr General, yours most respectfully and sincerely
