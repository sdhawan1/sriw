What Waggons Remain are to be loaded with Corn or Oats, and lest the Baggs be insufficient I have sent 700 Bushel Sand bags which are not to be used but in case of Necessity.
The Convoy of 18 Waggons which are now on the Road from fort frederick to fort Cumberland are to be forwarded to this place, and the Convoy that is said to be at Pearsalls the 15th are likewise to be sent on from fort Cumberland to this place.3 We are in great want of Grindstones ours not being come from fort frederick if you coud spare us a Couple, I should be much obliged to you, they may be replaced to you immediately. If you can send us any Entrenching Tools it will very much accelerate our Work. I am with great Regard Dear Sir Your most obedient and most humble Servant.

John St Clair


P.S. you may give the Waggoners for 4 Horses 6 Bushells of Corn for 14 Days.
