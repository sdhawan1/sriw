Blacks Compy in Colo. J. Brewers Regt and am Still Ready to Assist in the Cause on any Sudden Emergency But the Circumstances of my Family are Such as to Require my attendance and as I apprehend there are many Gentlemen in the Army Better Qualifyd than my Self for the Place For the above Reasons would beg Leave to Resign My Commission to your Excellency as I humbly Conceive it will be no injury to the Service.
