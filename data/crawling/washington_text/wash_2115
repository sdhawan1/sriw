My dear Stewart,
Williamsburg 2 May 1763.



With some difficulty I have at last procured the Inclosed which you will please to make use of as occasion may require.1 I was upon the point of forwarding these, and my Letters to you, by the Betcy a Ship from James River bound for London when Collo. Hunter arrived and informed me that he left you the 15th or 16th Ulto at New York and that your Imbarkation for England seemed to be matter of doubt.2 I have therefore changed the Route of these Letters now sending them to New York to the care of Beverley Robinson Esqr. who is desired to forward them in case of your departure from thence to London.3
The Bills as you may perceive are drawn on Messrs Lydes of London and Backhouse of Liverpool to the amount of 302


Sterlg that is to say




on Messrs Lyde for
222.0.0



& Mr Jno. Backhouse for
80.
302.0.04
