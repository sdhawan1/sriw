To Benja. Grymes Esqr.\Fredericksburgh/Sir
[Mount Vernon, 31 July 1755]



I dont remember \not recollect/ to have receivd more than one letter from you,1 and that I shoud have answerd \sooner/; but knowing that I coud give \you/ no satisfactory acct myself, of your Bed &ca, I thought it more advisable to desire Doctr Walker to enquire of
[349]
Mr Gist, and of Colo. Cresap (at whose Ho. I perfectly remember the great Tent was left) concerning them, and to let you know their answer.
I have since recollected, and think I am very certain, that Vanbraam who (was left out after Gist and I came off on Foot) \was/ charged with these and other things, told me that after havg \had/ most of his Horses tire\d/, he was obligd to leave your things, with many of my own, out at Mr Gists Ho. where they must have been burnt and destroyd with his Plantation.2
If you are going to England I heartily wish you a good Voyage, and the attainment of your utmost desires. I am Sir Yr most Obt Servt

Go: Wn
