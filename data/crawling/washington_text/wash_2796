Mount Vernon 26th June 72



If the Gentleman who owns the Negroe you were offering to sell will take Flour (Superfine) at 16/8 pr ct, or Herrings (I will undertake to say as good as any upon the River) at 15/ pr Barrl in pay I will give 65 for the Fellow; or I will give this Sum in Cash the Money payable in Octobr; before, I could not engage to pay for him in Money; unless I had a better prospect of selling a parcel of Flour which I have by me in the Country than appears at present.1 I remain with very great esteem Yr Most Obedt Servt

P.S. I have a Bow & arrows (just forged out) that will shew your skill a little better than the last, when you have a mind to come down & try them.
