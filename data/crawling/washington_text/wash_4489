Dr General
New Haven January the 16th 1776



We have been so baffled by the weather that We only arrivd here last nightI believe We shall find no difficulties in procuring a sufficient body of Volunteers for the N. York expeditionthe unhappy accounts from Canada seem to animate these People rather than depressindeed We have now occasion for exertion and decisionI am apprehensive that the Congress must be inspird by You They have just given a strong and I think unfortunate instance of indecisionColonel Waterbury had raisd a Regiment; the Regiment was equippd and ready for embarkationThey were to have landed in Oyster Bay to have attackd the Tories in Long IslandLord Stirling was to have attackd em on the other side all this by order of Congresswhen suddenly Colonel Waterbury receivd an order to disband his Regt and the Tories are to remain unmolested till They are joynd by the Kings Assasins1Governor Trumbul like a Man of sense and spirit, has orderd this Regt to be reassembledI believe it will be ready on Sunday the day on which I shall march from this Town2 I shall send immediately an express to the Congress informing em of my situation and at the same Time conjuring em not to suffer the accursed provincial Congress of New York to defeat measures so absolutely necessary to salvation3the affairs of Canada will I suppose very soon if not instantly require a very considerable Force from this Provinceneither will the circumstances of N. York admitt of its being too much strippd of Men, for which reason I shoud think it advisable immediately to raise some additional Regiments

in Massachusets Bay. Adieu, Dr General, God prosper you and the Arms of virtue. Yours most sincerely
