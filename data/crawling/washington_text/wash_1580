Captn Waggoner with 50 Men & 19 Waggons wait upon you for Provisions agreeable to my Yesterdays Return.1
A Letter which I have just receivd from Mr Walker tells me, that the Convoy may be expected at Pearsalls the 15th; and desires that the Escort (already consisting of 75 Men) may be reinforcd; as the Waggons and Cattle will cover a large space of Ground.2
Pray what will you have done with those Waggons when they come up, also with these now going for Provisions when they return from Rays Town.3
