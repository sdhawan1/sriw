To Captain Henry Harrison.Sir,

I congratulate you on your safe arrival at Fort-EdwardIf Ensign Hubbard applies to you for a reinforcement, you are to detach to his assistance a party of ten men:1 and if you have the same application from Homers-Fort,2 let them have the like number; and a small quantity of ammunition, if it can be spared. Yours

G:W.
