This qty of 53432 Acs. of Land, taken from the amts of the Surveys on the other side, leaves of the 30,000 Acs. (set apart in Oct. 1771 for satisfying any claims wch might thereafter come in, & for the further purpose of reembursing the few who had been at all the trouble & the whole risque) 18867 Acs. which, if appropriated to those who were full in advance at that time, & distributed according to the former propns, will go thus

And, if this Method of proportioning the 18867 Acres of Land is approvd of by yr Excely & Ho[no]rs, & you shall please to order as before, an Association of Names into each Patent so as to bring the amt of their sevl Claims as near to the qty of Land in the Survey as may be, the following method of doing it, probably will be found to answr as well as any other, as it cost some hours in shifting & changing the Claims from one Survey to another to bring them so near; but if any other method is better approvd of, it cannot but be equally agreeable to the Parties concernd, as chance, at all events, must have the Governmt of this matter.

As the Issuing of the Patents for these Lands will put an end to the business of this Grant (of 1754) so far as depends upon yr Excely & Honrs, I would beg leave to offer two points of material consequence to some of the Grantees, to the serious consideration & determination of the Board.
The first isAs none of the Patentees (under the mode adopted of Granting the Land to numbers in the same Patent) can be ascertaind of their particular Property therein till a legal division is established, wch, (as in the case of a late Grant of 28627 Acs. to 60 odd Patentees, is scarce practicable to accomplish, & of consequence, the savg of the Land by Cultivation & Improvemt next to Impossible, by wch means the intended Bounty offerd for a valuable consideration is not only rendd void, but to those who have contributed to the expence, evidently injurious, inasmuch as they have paid for that wch it is not in their power to come at) I say under these Circumstances, whether some expedient cannot be hit upon to serve those, who are willing, and desir[ou]s of complyg with the Tenor of the Grant, either by prolonging the time of Cultivation, if this can be done, or by directing each Mans share in any Patent to be laid off (if the division is not effected by consent of Parties) within a certain limitted period, of wch publick notice to be given, as each Pantentee thereafter shall respectively apply to the Surveyor; who may be instructed to lay the same in one body, & in a good figure, to prevent injustice.3
The Second matter to be offered iswhether something cannot, & if it can ought not to be done, to compel those who have never paid one farthing, or taken one single step towards obtaining these Lands (not even the Fees of Office on their own particular Tracts) to contribute in proportion to the qty of Land they have, & are to receive? Without something of this sort can be done previous to the Patenting, or in the Patenting of these Lands, nothing is to be expected from them afterwards; for where Men (I am speaking of those who hold principal Shares in this Grant for as to the common Soldiery, little ever was expected from them) are found so remiss, after repeated exhortation,
[362]
as neither to afford time, or Money, for the purpose of conducting a Work which could not possibly have gone on without both; little of the latter is to be expected after the business is at end, and their Patents delivered to them, unless letigeous Law suits are commencd, some of wch against Infants, & some against Persons beyond Sea; & without this, I must, after having been already saddled with almost the whole trouble, & many Expences peculiar to myself, submit to considerable loss; as I have been obliged to advance all the Fees of Officeanswer many drafts of the Surveyor& considerd I dare say by him, as liable for his whole Fees; assuredly having one, in that case, for the beforementioned Tract of 28627 Acres Patented to the common Soldiery to pay for without (I fear) their being a penny the better of it as no step hath yet been taken to obtain a divisionone year of the three gone& one half of them may never more be heard of.4
I have thus, may it please your Excely & honrs, endeavourd to draw the whole of this matter into one short view, to save you the trouble of refering from one Order of Council to anotherI have now to beg pardon for the trouble I have had occasion, from time to time to give in prosecuting this matter5& have the Honr to be Yr Lordships & Honrs Most Obedt & Most Hble Servt

Go: Washington
