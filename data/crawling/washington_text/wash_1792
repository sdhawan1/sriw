Dear Sir
Winchester Decr 20th 1758



We arrived on saturday last after a fatigueing & most severe marchThe men & officers both sufferd very much from hunger & coldMany of our men were obliged to be left at Raes Town & other places on the road through sickness; numbers of which, I fear will never see this placeGreat numbers are dayly flocking to the Hospital; and what is still more dreadfull not one medecine to give them for their relief. I heard when I came down the Surgn was broke yet rather than let brave fellows sufferI have dispatched an Express to Fridricksburg for some most material things; at my own risk.1
If The Troops are keept up medecines must be had for themTherefore have inclosed a list of the most necssary Articles,
[170]
And those will be immediatly wanted. for what I sent for; were but few, & I doubt much if they can be got at Fredricksburg2As you are present; Remonstrating the hardships the men ly under when sick for want of proper Accomodations, such as beding, Barley, Oatmeal, Sugar &c. probably they might be redressdWe are very anxious here to know the fate of the Troops, and who will be Commander. When the Regiment meets with that irrepareable lose, loseing youThe very thoughts of this lyes heavy on the whole whenever they think of itand dread the consequences of your resigning3I would gladly be advised by you whether or not you think, I had better continue, if they choose to keep me untill my Medecines come from England, or whether I had better resign directlyfor I am resolved not to stay in the service when you quit itThe Inhabitants of this place press me much to settle hereI likewise would crave your advise whether or not you think I had better except of their importunitiesor settle in Fairfax where you was so kind as to offer me your most friendly assistance4I hope youl pardon my freedom in giving you this troubleFor as I have experienced so much of your friendship and received so much friendly countenance from youI cannot help consulting you on this occasion as my most sincere freind.
I am extremly sorry to hear your bad state of health remaind with you when hereHowever I flatter my self with the hopes that you are wellAnd that as the fatigues of war are now mostly over, you will recover dayly.
By Mr Boyd I have sent down all my Accots that were not settled, & hope now to clear of all old scoresIf you dont expect to be up soon, would beg the favour of a line from youI ever am with the greatest Respect & Sincerity Dr Sir Your most obliged & obedt hume Sert
