Fort George [N.Y.] May 27th 1776



Last Night Colonel Clinton arrived and brought me the inclosed, by which I find the Note alluded to in mine of Yesterday was intended for me1I shall answer the Gentlemen on the Subject of the Gundalo to DayIf the Account given by McChord be true it is much to be lamented that the Siege of Quebec could not have been immediately reassumed.
The honorable Commissioners I suppose had not yet received the account that one hundred and fifty thousand Dollars, were on the way to Canada, when they wrote, nor of the one thousand seven hundred & thirteen transmitted me by Governor Cook; It will however be2 necessary to send more both to Canada and to Mr Trumbull at Albany, for Reasons I have given in a former Letter. I am most sincerely Your Excellencys most obedient humble Servant

P.S. Medicines are much wanted at this post & Ticonderoga. [P.]P.S. I have ordered a row Galley to be sent from Tyonderoga to be Converted Into a Gundalo, she served as Such last year when In possession of the Enemy.
