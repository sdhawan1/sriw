Dear Sir,
Febry 14th 1774



I have at last purchasd Mr John Rootess Land for you. He this Day assignd the Governors Warrant for it, to me, for your Use. I dont chuse to inclose it, for fear my Letter may miscarry, and am in hopes it will suit your Purpose as well, to receive it at Fredericksburg, the first Day of April; when I expect to have the Pleasure of meeting with you there. No Money will be requird of you, til I see you, and you think the Land sufficiently securd.1 I am Sir, Your very Servt
