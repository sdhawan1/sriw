respectg that suit on the Easten shore I realy did not know in what manner to order it tho. Colo. Pendleton advises me to bring Suit in County Court & upon an appeal we may come at much sooner then to sew [sue] to the Genl cot & I was at a loss to know in what manner to order the Suit but at last thought sew him for a trespass tho. there is three or four old Standers that will sware hard agst us, & thought it might be Easyly determind if I coud find how old Colo. Custiss land was bounded if it was Purchased or Patented for that is all the young man Claims by is what them three old Standers has to say& if you can inform me whether any Part was Purchased & where I must Serch for the deed suppose it must be Enterd upon record I had a notion of Serchg the record but thought I woud write to you first I saw one old Custis Kendall who says old Colo.

I once thought I should have had the pleasure of Writeing to you that I had as Likely a Prospect as coud have Possably been Expected from so poor a Piece of Earth at my Plantation where I live but it is Very far from it now for we have not had as much rain as to wet the Earth one Inch for 7 or 8 Weeks which make Every thing Look very Shockingly they have been more seasonable up the CountryYr Mourng was Sent by the Post Which I hope got Safe to hand I was much put to it to Get the Post to undertake,4 for our fellow Billey5 who is the only one that coud agone & he has been down with the measles & a Violent Lax & Vometing that follow it which have carried A Number of People off Abt us he is now very Ill & have not yet employd a Docter for they Have had bad success to those where they have been imployd tho.
