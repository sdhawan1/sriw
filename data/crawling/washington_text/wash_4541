Dr General
Stamford [Conn.] Janry the 24th 1776



It was unnecessary sooner to trouble you with my scrowlas I coud give you no information, the least interesting[.] I find the People through this Province more alert and zealous than my most sanguine expectationI believe I might have collected ten thoushand VolunteersI take only four Companies with me and Waterburys Regt which is so happily situated on the frontierWards Regt I have orderd to remain at their respective homes untill They hear further1these Connecticutians are, if possible, more eager to go out of their Country than They are to return home when They have been out for any considerable timeinclosd I send you My letter to the General Congressthat of the Provincial Congress of N. York to me, with my answer,2 I hope it will have your approbationThe Whigs, I mean the stout ones, are it is said, very desirous that a Body of Troops shoud march and be stationd in their Citythe Timid ones are averse merely from the spirit of procrastination which is the characteristic of timiditythe letter of the Provincial Congress, You will observe, breaths the very essence of this Spiritit is wofully hystericalI conclude I shall receive the orders of the General Congress before or immediately on my arrivalotherwise I shoud not venture to march
[183]
into the Provinceas by their late resolve evry detachment of the Continental Troops is to be under the direction of the Provincial Congress in which They area resolve, I must say with submission to their Wisdom, fraught with difficulties and evilit is impossible having two Sovereigns, that any busyness shoud be carried onhave You seen the pamphlet Common Sense? I never saw such a masterly irresistible performanceit will if I mistake not, in concurrence with the transcendant folly and wickedness of the Ministry give the coup de grace to G. Britainin short I own myself convincd by the arguments of the necessity of seperation3Poor Brave Montgomery! but it is not a time to cry but to revengeGod bless You, My Dr General, and crown us with the success I am sure We merit from the goodness of our causeMy love to the LadiesI shall write a long letter to Gates when I have time and Materialsadieu, Yours most affectionately.
