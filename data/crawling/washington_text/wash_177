[Fort Cumberland, Md., 18 July 1755]



As I have heard since my arrivl at this place,1 a circumstantial acct of my death and dying Speech, I take this early oppertunity of contradicting both \the first/, and of assuring you that I  illegible 2 of the livg by the miraculous care of \I have not, as yet, composed the latter. But by the all powerful dispensatns of/ Providence, that \I have been/ protected me beyond all human expectation; \probability & expectation for/ I had 4 Bullets through my Coat, and two Horses shot under and yet \me yet although death was levelling my companions on every side of me./ escaped unhurt.
We have been most scandalously beaten by a trifling body of men; but fatiegue, and the want of time, \will/ prevents me from erasure\give/ing \you/ any of the erasure \details un/till I have the happiness of seeing you at home \Mount Vernon/; which I now most ardently wishd for, since we are drove in thus far. A Weak, and Feeble State of Health, obliges me to halt here for 2 or 3 days, to recover a little strength, that I may thereby be enabled to proceed homewards with more ease; You may expect to see me there on Saturday or Sunday Senight,3 which is as soon as I can well be down as I shall take my Bullskin Plantations in my way. Pray give my Compts to all my Fds. I am Dr Jack Yr most Affecte Brothr
