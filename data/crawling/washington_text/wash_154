To Mr Jno. Auge Washington\Mount Vernon/Dear Jack \Brother/
[Winchester, 28 May 1755]



I came to this place last Night, and was greatly disappointed at not finding the Cavalry according to promise: I am obligd to wait till it does arrive, or till I can procure a guard from the Militia, either of which I suppose will detain me two days; as you may, with almost equal success, attempt to raize the Dead to Life again, as the force of this County; and that from Wills Creek cannot be expected in less than the aforementiond time without they are now upon their March.1
The Droughth in this County, if possible, exceeds what we see below; so that, it is very reasonably conjecturd, they wont make Corn to suffice the People \supply the Inhats/; and as for Tobacco, they decline all thoughts \have given up the expectation/ of making any.2
The Inhabitants of this place abound in News, but as I apprehend it is founded upon as much truth \baseless a foundation/ as some I heard i\o/n my way down, I think it advisable to forego the recital till a little better authority confirms the report3 and t\T/hen you may expect to have a succinct acct \narative of it/.
I should be glad to hear \that/ you live in \perfect/ Harmony and good fellowship with the family at Belvoir, as it is in their power to be very serviceable upon many occasions to us as young beginners: I woud advise your visiting \there/ often as one Step towards \it/
[290]
the rest, if any more is necessary, your own good sense will sufficient dictate; for to that Family I am under many obligations particularly to the old Gentleman.4
Mrs Fairfax and Mrs Spearing5 \having/ expressd an Inclination to hear whether I had \a wish to be informed of the time, and manner of my reaching/ erasure  this place (with my charge safe) you may therefore acquaint them that, I met with no other Interruption, than \what procd from/ the difficulty of gettg Horses6 after I found hers for want of Shoes \hers (Mrs Fairfaxs)/ grew lame, I was obligd to get a fresh horse \one/ every 15 or 20 Mile\s/, which renderd the journey tiresome \tedeous/[.] I shoud have receivd greater relief \been more refreshed/ from the fatiegues of my journey, and my time woud have been spent much more agreeably had I halted below rather than in this vile hole \instead of being delayd in this place/;7 but I little imagind I shoud have \had/ occasion to wait for a Guard who ought to have waited for me; if either must have waited at all.
I have given Colo. Fairfax an Order upon you for 8.17.5 which please to pay, as it is on acct of a horse wch I bought of Neale some time ago.8 You \will/ receive Inclosd, Bowees receipt for Harry, and I shoud be glad, if you have any oppertunity, that you woud demand My \the/ Bond which I had \have/ given, and coud not receive at payment of \the time I paid/ the money; this receipt you may put into my rece[i]pt draw.9 My Compliments attend my Friends who I wish health and happiness to, very sincerely; I am Dear Jack Your most Affectionate Brother

P.S. As I understand your County \the County of Fairfax/ is to be divided,10 and that Mr Alexander intends to decline serving it, I shoud be glad if
[291]
you coud fish out \come at/ Colo. Fairfaxs Intentions, and let me know whether he purposes to offer himself \as/ a Candadite; If he does not, I shoud be glad to stand \take/ a pole, if I thought my chance tolerably good.11 Majr Carlyle mentiond it to me in Williamsburg in a bantering \way/ and askd how I shoud like to go \it/, saying at the same time, he did not know but they might send me when I \might/ kne\o/w nothing of the matter, for one or tother of the Counties. I must own \confess/ I shoud like to go for either, in that manner, but more particularly for Fairfax, as I am a resident there. I shoud be glad if you coud discover Major Carlyles real Sentimts \on this head/ also those of Mr Dalton, Ramsay, Mason, &ca wch I hope & think you may \do/ witht disclosing much of mine; as I know yr own good sense can furnish you with means enough without letting it proceed immediately from me \contrivances/. If you do \should attempt/ any thing in this \matter/ pray let me know by the first oppertunity how you have succeeded in it; & how those Gentlemen stand affected; if they seem inclinable to promote my Interest, and things shoud be drawing to a crisis you then may declare my Intentions & beg their assistanceIf on the Contrary you find them more inclind to favour some other, I wd have the Affair entirely subside \dropped/. Parson \The Revd Mr/ Greens, and Captn McCartys Interests in this \matter/ woud be of Consequence; & I shoud be glad if you coud sound their Pulse\s/ upon that occasion; conduct the whole, till you are satisfied of the Sentimts of those I have mentiond, with
[292]
an air of Indifference & unconcern; after that you may regulate your conduct accordingly \to circumstances/. Captn West the present Burgess, and our Friend Jack West, coud also be servicable if they had a mind to assist the Interest of Dear Jack Your loving Brother12
