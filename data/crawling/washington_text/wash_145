To Mr Jno. Auge Washington\Mount Vernon/Dear Jack \Brother/
[Fort Cumberland, Md., 14 May 1755]



As wearing Boots is quite the Mode, and mine \are/ in a declining State; I must beg the favour of you to procure me a pair that is good, and neat, and send them to Major Carlyle, who I hope will contrive them as quick as my necessity requires.1
I see no prospect of moving from this place \soon/; as we have neither Horses nor Waggons enough, and no forage for them to subsist upon but \except/ what is expe[c]ted from Philidelphia;2 therefore, I am well convinced that the trouble and difficulty we must encounter in passing the Mountain for want of proper conveniences, will equal all the other Interruptions \difficulties/ of the Campaigne; for I conceive the March of such a Train of Artillery in these Roads to be a tremendous undertaking: As to any danger from the Enemy I look upon it as a trifling, for I believe

they \French/ will be obligd to exert their utmost Force to repel the attacks to the Northward, where Governour Shirley and others with a body of 8,000 Men will annoy their Settlements and attempt their Forts.3
The Genl has appointed me one of his aid\s/ de Camps,4 in which Character I shall serve this Campaigne, agreeably enough, as I am thereby freed from all command\s/ but his, and give \his/ Orders to all, which must be implicitly obeyd. I have now a good oppertunity, and shall not neglect it, of forming an acquaintance which may be serviceable hereafter, if I can \shall/ find it worth while pushing \to/ my Fortune in the Military way. \line/.
I have wrote to my two female corrispondants by this oppertunity, one of which Letters I have inclosd \to/ you, & beg yr deliverance off \it/.5 I shall expect a Succinct \particular/ acct of all that has happend since my departure. I am Dear Jack Yr most Affecte Brothr
