The uneasiness you Lye under from the Vain Babling of Worthless, Malicious, Envious Sycophants, give me much ConcernConscious of a Due & Honorable Discharge of Your Duty, (as undoubtedly you Must be) Their Censure, & Scurrility loses its force & Venom by Your Silent Contempt, and DisdainNo Character or Station is free from Calumny, and to be Sure, You cant expect a Singularity of that nature, Especialy in that Conspicuous Office You so justly holdThe Selfevident Falsitys aserted by that Witty Writer of the Centinell, must Condemn him in the Judgement of every Rationall, Reflecting Beingand to Regard his Illnatured Slander by Vindication of Facts would be a Condescension, arguing a Consciousness of the CrimeWhich is all that his Spite Aims at.2
In the Short time I have had to dive into the Generall Opinion of Your resignation I find it disagreable, & unpleasant to all their inclinations, and woud certainly be at a Loss for Such another to fill your placeI Communicated yours to Mr Ramsay who thinks as every Body else must, that to Lay down Your Commission now, woud be the Means of More reflections, and Less Satisfaction to youTho, Two, three or four are gatherd together to foment an ill spirit of Slander, and propogate Lyes, to amuse the Unthinking MobYou & every Reasonable person is Sensible that the Whole thinking part of the Legislative power, are Much in Your Interest, & pleased with your Conduct for the preservation of the CountryHow far you have missd in the design cannot be Laid to your Charge, on a Single review of the Circumstances, Difficulties, and Extent of Frontier.
