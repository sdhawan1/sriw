Tis now some Time since I wrote to Mr Woodford, desireing him to procure me the Papers I left in yr Hands relative to my affair with Rennolds, I am now in want of them, and as he informd me You would send them if wanting, beg youll contrive
[39]
them pr first opportunity.1 I receivd Yrs in which You inform me of yr giving Jackson the Liberty to inlist a Man in Lieu of himself, I am much obligd to You for the Indulgence, & indeed could have expected no more.2
I should not desire the Papers but Rennolds has sued me & I cant possibly do without them, I should Think a Coppy of them would do for yr Bussiness, I am Sr Yr obligd Humble Servt
