To Mrs Washington\near Frederickg/Honourd Madam
[Mount Vernon, 14 August 1755]



If it is in my power to avoid going to the Ohio again, I shall, but if the Command is pressd upon me by the genl voice of the Country, and offerd upon such terms as cant be objected against, it woud reflect eternal dishonour upon me to refuse it; and that I am sure must, or ought, to give you greater cause of uneasiness than my going in an honourable Comd; for upon no other terms I will accept of it, if I do at all; at present I have no
[360]
proposals, or any mention made abt it, only \made to me nor have any advice of such an intention except/ from private hands. I am Dr Mm &c.
