My dear Colo.
Wmsburg 26 Sepr 1758



To hear of the welfare of my Friend will always give me great Satisfaction, but your kind Letter of 8th Sepr has afforded infinite Pleasure. as in a paragraph of a Letter you some time ago
[49]
wrote to Colo. Tayloe you mentiond my being unmindful of you, by not answering a letter that you had wrote to me soon after I had the Pleasure of seeing you last, wch I have never received therefore I must believe it has fallen into the Hands of the curious. I shoud be pleased if I coud find out the person & will endeavor to do it, tho I am afraid it will be a difficult task.1
Your kind wishes for my Happiness deserve my most thankful acknowledgements. mine you have, with unfiegned sincerity, and I am truly concernd to find that the prospect of yours is so distant. I can only wish & that I will do most ardently that success may attend all your undertakings (& that soon) of wch Happiness must be the consequence.
I woud write to you the resolutions of the House of Burgesses but none of them as yet are compleated. I am informd that the Govr detains Jenkins until they are, that you may be fully advised of them,2 and my Business obliges me to be absent for a few days, & lest he shoud be sent off before my return, I shoud have been wanting in my Friendship to you, if I was not to write, tho it shoud be nothing more than to assure you that I am with the greatest Truth my dear Colo. your mo. Affte & Obedt Servt
