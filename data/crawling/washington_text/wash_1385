Sir
Fort Hopewell Aprill 30th 1758.



I should have complyd with your orders in Sending an officer or two Recruiting, but its Imposible to do It without leaveing some of the Forts without an officer, Theres Not two at any place but this & Capt. McKenzies.1 I recd a Letter From Mr Boyd who informd me, it was yr orders for an officer From Each company to come Down for the pay, which accordingly I have sent. Capt. McKenzie Petisiond to go him self and Settle his Pay Rolls with Mr Boyd, As Mr Gist is but Just Returnd with the Indianes, & very much Fatigued, the Particulars Of his Discoverys youll be informd of by Capt. McKenzie.2
Your Recruiting orders shall be Punktually Obeyd. But beleive few, or none will Inlist on the Branch, as they Say they are doing their mutilated the same service, as if Inlisted, As for the charges against Lt Steenbergen, the Officers that Come Down will give them in to you.3 I am Sir Your most Obedt Humble Servt

Thos Waggener
