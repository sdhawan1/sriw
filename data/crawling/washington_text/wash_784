I just recd yours of yesterday1 by Rollines and upon Examination it appears that what he complaind off to you are literally as follows Vizt.
Amongst the other precautions I had taken to prevent Drunkeness and Irregularity which by Rolliness means then became prevalent amongst the Soldiers here, I orderd the Officer of the Guard to visit the Tippling House every Night sometime after Tatoo Beating, and to confine any of the Soldiers that might then be found Drinking thereLieut. Campbell happend Officer of the Guard the night Rollines complains off, and went into his House at a Door that was quite open but that he did not abuse Rollines nor even speak to him he and those who went the Rounds with him are willing to swearOne Day Rollines who was much insensd at a stops being put to his selling Liquor to the Soldiers was cursing all the Officers in the grosset terms and said many audacious provoking things, upon which Serjeant Hughes told him that if were not for the Law he would whip him, Rollines replied that he would take no advantage of the Law desird one of the Inhabitants here to be his second & stript, then he & Hughes went at it and Hughes gave him a most sincere DrubbingRollines never complaind to me nor did he apply to you till after he found that Govr Sharp would not hear his Scandulous falsehoods against the Virga Officers2he has since had the assurance to tell my Servant that unless I gave him Liberty to Sell Liquor to the Soldiers that you would send me from hereI hopd you would have mentiond something of Catons affair and his as I conceive that by it the Country has been defrauded and Laws trappld uponThe Deserters will be tried agreeable to your orders But any Punishmt a regimental Court martial can order will am afraid have little weight with some of themGovernor Sharp is Building his Fort 14 Miles from the Mouth of the Creek at Johnsons Plantation on Potomack River3Inclosd is a Return of the Detachmt and the Provisions on hand, and doubts not but you will order us a supply of Flower before what is on hand is exausted4Last night I was obligd to put a Soldier (one of Rolliness Custommers) in Irons for Mutiny.
