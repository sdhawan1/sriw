Honorable Sir
Bullskin September 3d 1758



I have Received yours of the 27th Ulto by wch I find you have not Received my last Letter to you, in which I have given an acct of the Crop both of Tobacco & Corn lest it shoud Miscarry I also send you an acct thereof.1 Viz. The Tobo is very Backward on acct of the Drought, as also the Corn, we have housd I believe about fifteen Hundred which I woud rather was still out, if it woud allow it, as it might have been better since the late Rain we have had on Thursday & Friday last: what is out is much better since the late Rain.
In regard to the Oats, we have made but a very small Crop By Reason of the Drought also, not more I believe than about Twenty Bushels out of Ten Bushels Sowing, I cant get any one at present to Thresh the wheat without giving an Extraordy price which is a penny half penny more than usual, & if youl have it Threshd at that price I shall get it done, as I cant spare any of our own people to do it, the Tobo being so Latter that they cant be spared from it. I have sent the Mare & four Colts to Mount Vernon,2 we have lost no horses nor anything else since you have been gone, Mr Smith has Employd the Waggon last Week at the Fort, & Employs it also this Week, I have Wrote to Mr Snickers abt the Mares, his answer is that the Mare he Sold you, he Bought of one Samuel Givins in Augusta County, to
[452]
whom he wrote about her to make a strict Enquiry for her & if found that he shoud be well rewarded,3 & says also that if the Mare you had of Capt. Lindsey is not stopt, she will come up to the Blue Ridge within about Nine Miles of where he lives, & if she does that he will secure her for you.4
your Negroes are all well, except Adam & old Bland Adam has had the fever & Ague & now is troubled with a Swelling in his Throat, but is getting better,5 we have Two Oxen here, for which I dont see any use, more so as we have Horses Enough to do any Business we have to do, also they are very troublesome to the Neighbours Destroying their Corn, &c. & if you approve of it, I shall fatten them & make them fit for Markett, as we have Six head more that I can make fit for the Markett, since I have sent the Mare & Colts to Mount Vernon there has been one Pritchard6 with me who lays Claim to them, I asked him how he came by them last Winter, he told me they were brought to him by a Man whose Name he does not know, if you Remember, I have told you that one of the Waggon Horses went off with them last Winter, I Desired the man to Write to you about them as the year & a Day was Expired in posting them,7 I have wrote to you always when I had any thing material to mention to you, & shall Continue so to do.
Our last planting is Just the same since planted by reason of the long drought we have had, till this last rain, & am afraid it will never come to any perfectionbut shall do my Endeavours to make the most I can of it. I am with due Respect Sir yr most humble & Obedient Servt

Chris. Hardwick
