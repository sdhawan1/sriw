This comes to Fredericksburg fair1 in hopes of meeting with a speedy Passage to you if your not there which hope youl get shortly altho. I am almost discouraged from Writing to you as this is my fou[r]th to you since I receivd any from yourself. I hope youl not make the Old Proverb good out of sight out of Mind as its one of the greatest Pleasures I can yet foresee of having in Fairfax in Often hearing from you hope youl not deny it me.
I Pass the time of much more agreabler than what I imagined I should as theres a very agreable Young Lady lives in the said house where I reside (Colo. George Fairfaxs Wife Sister) that in a great Measure chears my sorrow and dejectedness tho. not so as to draw my thoughts altogether from your Parts I could wish to be with you down there with all my heart but as it is a thing almost Impractakable shall rest my self where I am with hopes of shortly having some Minutes of your transactions in your Parts which will be very welcomely receivd by Your.
