To Mrs Fairfax,\Belvoir/Dear Madam
[Fort Cumberland, Md., 7 June 1755]



When I had the pleasure to see you last, you expressd an Inclination \a wish/ to be informd of my safe arrival at Camp, with the charge that was entrusted to my care;1 but at the same time desird \requested that/ it might be communicated in a Letter to some body \friend/ of your\s/ acquaintance: This I took as a Gentle rebuke and polite manner of forbidding my corrisponding with you; and conceive this opinion is not illy founded when I reflect that I have hitherto found it impracticable to engage one moment of your attention: If I am right in this, I hope you will excuse my present presumption and lay the imputation to elateness at my successfull arrival; If on the contrary these are fearfull apprehensions only, \Am I to consider the proposd mode of Comn as a polite intimation of your wishes to withdraw your corrispondence? To a certain degree it has that appearance; for I have not, been honored with a line from you since I parted with you at Belvoir. If this was your object in what manner shall I apologise for my present disobediencebut on the contrary, if it was the effect of your delica[c]y/ how easy is it to remove my suspicions, enliven my Spirits, \dull hours/ and make me happier than the Day is long \I am able to express/, by honouring
[309]
me with a \the/ corrispondance which you did once partly promise \you had given me hope of/.2
Please to make my Complts to Miss Hannah \Fairfax/, and to Mr Bryan \Fairfax/ to whom I shall do myself the pleas[ur]e of writing so \as/ soon as I hear he is returnd from Westmoreland. I am Madam Yr most Obedt & most Hble Servt
