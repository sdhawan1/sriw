Sir,
[c.1762]



At your request I have mutilated / my Papers, & found the remarks/ mutilated for the Remarks I made upon the Navigation of Potomack in the year 17541 & found the copy mutilated a Letter which I wrote to a gentn of our Assembly / in Aug.2 1754/ at that time. the followg is an extract thereof.3
Sir,
Your desire & my /own/ curiosity together /engaged/ excited me the last time when last4 I was in Frederick to explore the Navigation of Potomack /downwards/ and the followg observations I made in My passage down it.
From the Mouth of Patersons Creek to the Shannondoah Falls /are no/ you encounter no other obstacles but shallow Water (in places, & this only at certain Seasons) /to encounter/. but from hence there is Rocky, Swift & consequently uneven Water for near Six Miles in which distance there are 4 falls. the first /of which is tolerable clear of Rocks/ is shallow & pretty clear of Rocks /but very capable of relief/ wch may be avoided by opening a Channel on the Maryland sideAbt 2 Miles from this & half a one below the Mouth of Shanh lyes what is commonly called the Spout wch indeed is the principal /difficulty commonly called the Spout/ and /indeed/ I might almost add the only difficulty of the whole. The Water here is confined to narrow bounds5 & having a pretty considerable fall at the same time6 shoots thro. with great rapiditythe risk of passing this sluce is somewhat Increased by the7 Rockyness of the bottom which occasioning8 dry uneven surface. Subjects9 small Vessels to the danger of fillingI passed it in a Canoe & was near sinkg here may likewise be had a passage on the Maryland Shore thro. wch Vessells with ease may be hauled up. after removing some Rocks at a moderate expenceOne of the other two Falls is swift & ugly not much unlike the last. but when the River is
[176]
swelled beyond its usual bounds might10 (or I believe in any other than this dry Season) a passage is to be had /round a small/ between a small Island & the North Main /on the North Side/ which passage may be greatly Improvd. /Abt/ Eight miles lower /down/ is another fall, but very easy & passable and at the end of two Miles /further/ more is a cluster of small Islands with numberless Rocks & rapid Water, which renders the Passage somewhat in its prest state11 precariousFrom hence to the Seneca Falls /is mutilated/ a fine water scar[c]e any perceptable Fall. The Seneca fall is mutilateded12 in two places & Canoes may now proceed within 2 miles of the gmutilatedther13 it is not practacable till great alterations are made.
These Sir are the Observns mutilated year 1754 when I hoped (upon /examination/) seeing the Practicability of the thing that the expediency mutilated this Comns woud have been attended to /in the practicable light I beheld/14 & that mutilated our future operations, wd have been conducted /thro. this Chanl I/ mutilated /cant charge my Mem[or]y/ in this most rational or pointed manner but Genl Bradks mutilated late coming in Spring 1755 & hurry of business /when he did come/ illegible immediately upon his arrival allowed no time for mutilated attempts of this sort. & afterwards our affairs as everybody knows took /a very different/ quite another turn. & was conducted from a very difft Quarter cannot charge my Memory with any mutilated further knowledge but you are welcome to make what use you mutilated please of the Informn.
