Nothing new Since, only two men have deserted Viz. John Clandinnon1 a damnable tall fellow & Adam Clandinnon his brother inlisted lately by Lt Charles SmithI have sent Advertisements through pennsylvania, & have trusted to the Officers of their Companies to send you by this Opportunity.
I have thirteen of Capt. Flemings Company left here sick, one of Capt. Fields Company had his Leg broke yesterday & another cut himself much on the Road, These besides our own sick, are a Burthen to me, which would be much relievd by a Surgeons mateI Expected Mr Johnston yesterday, And Begyou will order him off immediatly if the Bearer shoud find him at Fort Cumberland.2 I am with Respect, Sir, your most Obt hbl.
