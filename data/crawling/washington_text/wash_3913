Dr Sir
Mount Vernon Octbr 5th 1775



I received Your Letter of the 28th Augst on tuesday afternoon1 it was rather too late for me to go up to Alexandria, & I had promised to meet Mrs Washington at Mr Diggs to bring her over the River2but I immedeately wrote to Mr Harrison upon other Business, which I was sure woud bring him to Mt Vernon so soon as he receivd my LetterMr Muir wrote me Harrison was gone to Occoquan & from thence was to go to his fathersEarly on yesterday Morning I sent after him but unluckily he coud not be found any where within the Neighbourhood of Occoquan, it was a very rainy day yesterday, my messenger did not return until night, I suppose he is over at his fathers, & did not go to Occquan so that I cannot with Certainty inform you by this letter, whether Mr Harrison will Accept the offer you make him or not, but I can hardly think he or any other American woud refuse it3about ten days past in Conversasion with Mr Harrison he told me nothing but his haveg two Young Children had kept him so long from enterg into the Army, & he now almost wishd he had went to you this summer, for shoud there be a rupture here, he shoud most certainly be engaged in it & he might as well have done it at oncewas I to judge from the Conversation we had, I think I can almost venture
[116]
to say he will thankfully accept your offer & be with you almost as soon as this Letter, but shoud he not I will inform you immediately by a Gentleman who leaves Alexandria on monday next, to go to Philadelphia which letter perhaps may come to hand as soon as this.4 Tis true many people have made a Stir about Mrs Washingtons Continuing at Mt Vernon but I cannot think her in any Sort of dangerthe thought I believe first originated in Alexandriafrom thence it got to Loudon, I am told the people of Loudon talkd of sendg a Guard to Conduct her up into Berkeley with some of their principle men to persuade her to leave this & accept their offerMr John Agst. Washington wrote to her pressg her to leave Mt Vernonshe does not believe herself in danger, nor do I. without they attempt to take her in the dead of Night they woud fail, for 10 minutes notice woud be Sufficient for her to get out of the wayLord dunmore will hardly Venture himself up this River, nor can I think he will send upon that errand surely her old acquaintance the attorney (who with his family are aboard his Ship) woud put him off doing an Act of that kind5I have never Advised her to stay nor Indeed to go, Col. Bassett thinks her in no dangeryou may depend I will be watchfull, & upon the least Alarm persuade her to moveshe setts off next week with her son & Daughter down the Country6I cannot Recollect I ever wrote to you when she did not, once her Letter was not Inclosed in mine but were both sent under Cover to Mr MilnorI write every week. we are not yet done sewg Wheat, it has been a very unlucky season for itAlways raing the rain yesterday & today will prevent any more being sewd this Weekwe have almost finishd repairg the Damage done our Tumblg Damsit has been principally done by the Miller & Coopers & I think will never be carried away againwe have lengthend the dam so that the water has 16 feet more Vent than it had, the plat forom made much more substantial than before, & Indeed the whole of the worck done in the Strongest mannernot yet done the Store Houseshall Raise the wash House or Servts House next WeekJohn Broad Sick, Brick layers When the Weather will permit about the Garden WallStoco worckman will be 3 weeks yet about the Dineg Room, & Sears has about one weeks worck yet upon the Chimney piece at
