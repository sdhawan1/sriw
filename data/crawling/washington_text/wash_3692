A Gentleman whose name is Banister (as silly a Gentleman perhaps as lives) is accused by his Country men the People of Newport, of being a most violent ToryI believe He is neither whig nor Tory, but an eater and drinkerit is in my opinion not worth troubling You with himbut I am obligd through complacency to the Corps herein, to refer him to your Excellency They will I suppose bring their charges against him.1 I am, Sir, Your most obed.
