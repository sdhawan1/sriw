Mount Vernon, July 15 1773.



The subscriber, having obtained patents for upwards of 20,000 acres of land, on the Ohio and great Kanhawa, being part of 200,000 acres, granted by proclamation, in 1754, (10,000 of which are situated on the banks of the first mentioned river, between the mouths of the two Kanhawas; the remainder on the Great Kanhawa or New River, from the mouth, or near it, upwards in one continued survey) proposes to divide the same into any sized tenements that may be desired, and lease them upon moderate terms, allowing a reasonable number of years, rent free; provided that, within the space of two years from next October, three acres for every fifty contained in each lot, and proportionable for a lesser quantity, shall be cleared, fenced, and tilled, and that by or before the time limitted for the commencement of the first rent, five acres for every hundred, and proportionably, as above, shall be inclosed and laid down in good grass for meadow; and moreover that at least fifty good fruit trees, for every like quantity of land, shall be planted on the premises.
Any persons inclinable to settle upon these lands, may be more fully informed of the terms, by applying to the subscriber, near Alexandria, in Virginia, or, in his absence, to Mr Lund Washington; and will do well in communicating their intentions before the 1st of October next, in order that a sufficient number of lots may be laid off to answer the demand.
As these lands are among the first which have been surveyed, in the part of the country where they lie, it is almost needless to premise, that none can exceed them in luxuriency of soil, or convenience of situation; all of them lying upon the banks either of the Ohio, or Kanhawa, and abounding in fine fish and wild fowl of various kinds, as also in most excellent meadows, many of which (by the bountiful hand of nature) are in their present state almost fit for the scythe.
From every part of these lands water carriage is now had to Fort-Pitt, by an easy communication, and from Fort-Pitt up the Monongahela to Red Stone, vessels of convenient burthen may, and do pass continually; from whence, by means of Cheat River, and other navigable branches of Monongahela, it is thought
[279]
the portage to Patowmack may, and will be reduced within the compass of a few miles, to the great ease and convenience of the settlers, in transporting the produce of their lands to market; to which may be added that, as patents have now actually passed the seals, for the several tracts here offered to be leased, settlers on them may cultivate and enjoy the land in peace and safety, notwithstanding the unsettled councils, respecting a new colony on the Ohio; and as no right money is to be paid for these lands, and a quitrent of two shillings sterling a hundred, demandable some years hence only, it is highly presumable that they will always be held upon a more desirable footing, than where both these are laid on with a very heavy hand. It may not be amiss further to observe, that if the scheme for establishing a new government on the Ohio, in the manner talked of, should ever be effected, these must be among the most valuable lands in it, not only on account of the goodness of the soil, and the other advantages above enumerated, but from their contiguity to the seat of government, which more than probable will be fixed at the mouth of the Great Kanhawa.
