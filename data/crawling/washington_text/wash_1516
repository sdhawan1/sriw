Sir
Camp at Raes Town July 19th 1758



Col. Bouquet was at first in a great dillemma betwixt his great inclination to serve you, & the Attachment he has to regularity, duty & discipline. He is sensible the Enemy we deal with is Active and Enterprizing, & thinks himself answerable for What happens in your absence: But as he is really a good man, & willing to Oblige; His Inclination to Serve you gaind the Superiority, and He has such a favourable Opinion of you that, he will not easily believe that Matters go Right untill you return.1
I have sent a provision Return of this Detachmt and will Obey your Orders respecting the Dress &c.2
John Dow never wrote me whether you paid him my order, 30 for illegible, Alexander, & Lochard & 23 Lt Blaggs amounting to 53.3 If it is not Paid, be so good as take up the Order now you are going down, and oblige Sir, your most Obt hube Sert
