When Colo. Frys Corps & Capt. McKays Compa. join You, You will be enabled to act with better Vigour. I am in daily Expectatn of seeing or hearing from Colo. Innes, & a Body of Cherokee Inds. which I shall direct to march with all Diligence. I have sent Colo. Cresap to bring away Monsr Le Force & the other Prisoners, which You will deliver him, & be thereby relievd from the Anxiety of guarding so many Prisoners with Yr small Number.2 I have causd an Assortmt of Indn Goods to be packt up in order to be sent You immediately; & have engagd Mr Croghan as an Interpreter to attend the Commander in Chief, assist in delivering the several Presents, & advise You in all matters You may have occasion to consult him about, hoping his faithful demeanour will merit Yr & the Officers kind reception & Entertainmt3I have also sent out of my private Store some rum, which will be sent You with the Goods from this on Monday nextI wait with Impatience the return of Burney to know whether the Half King comes here.
