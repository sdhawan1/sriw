To John Robinson esquireTreasurer.Dr Sir.
[Fort Loudoun, 10 May 1758]



I can not inform you better of the strange, and unaccountable dilemma I am reduced to, than by transmitting a copy of that part of my letter relative to Recruiting; and a copy also of a Council held here on that occasion.1 I must beg your assistance in the affairif you can give any consistently: If I am to suffer, I can only say, that it is but poor encouragement for the exertion of my zeal.
Here followed all that part of my letter to the President, relative to Recruiting.2

G:W.
Ft Loudoun May 10th 1758.
