You must be particularly careful that there are exact returns made to the Troops every day, that there may be no more provisions drawn for than is right: and you are to sign all Orders for provisions, and such other absolute necessaries as are required. Captain Peachy will have the overlooking and management of the Workmen and is to be exempted from other Duty. He has orders to draw out as many men daily to work (reserving enough to mount Guard) as can be employed to advantage, and is to have such Officers to assist him, as he shall apply for.3 All the Soldiers that are unemployed, in the aforesaid Duty, are to be formed into Squads and duly exercised and regularly trained twice or thrice a-dayYou must endeavour to inculcate due obedience upon the new Recruitsand to discourage Swearing and Drinking.
