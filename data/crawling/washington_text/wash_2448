[119]
on the low grounds their is sum forrod tobo at Rockahock which I think is greatly hurt by the wet I Came from Deavenports yesterday and he has a peace of tobo that is prittey forrod and it is Quite over done with the wet in many places it is turnd yeallow and stakey and when it is so it never will make good tobo if it is accassond by the wet we had a powerful Rain last night which Coverd Sum of my Tobo under water again if their was ass mutch their I am afraid it has drownded that peace of tobacoI will let you no in a little time how those Crops are likely to turn out which at this time are but bad prospect have no more to ad Sir but Remain your Most hble Sert
