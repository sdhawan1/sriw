Sir
Wmsburg Augst 1st 1754



The Council met Yesterday & considering the present State of our Forces, & reason to think the French will be strongly reinforcd next SpringIt was resolvd that the Forces shoud immediately march over the Allegany Mountains, either to dispossess the French of their Fort, or build a Fort in a proper Place that may be fixd on by a Council of WarColo. Innes has my Orders for the executing the above Affair1I am therefore now to order You to get Your regiment compleated to 300 Men, & I have no doubt but You will be able to enlist what You are defficient of Yr Number very soon, & march directly to Willss Creek to join the other Forces2And that there may be no Delay, I order You to march what Companies You have compleat; & leave orders with the Officers remaining to follow You as soon as they have enlisted Men sufficient to make up their Compas.
You know the Season of the Year calls for Dispatch; I depend on Yr former & usual Diligence, & Spirit, to encourage Yr People to be active on this Occasion. Consult with Majr Carlyle
[181]
what Amunition may be wanting that I may send it up immediately: I trust much on Your Diligence & Dispatch in geting Your regiment to Willss Creek as soon as possibleColo. Innes will consult You in the appointing of Officers in Yr regimentPray consider if possible or practicable to send a Party of Indians &ca to destroy the Corn at the Fort & Logstown this would be of great Service, & a very great Disappointment to the Enemy. I can say no more but to press Dispatch of Yr Regiment to Willss Creek, & that Success may attend our Arms & just Expedition is the sincere Desire of Sr Yr very hble Serv.
