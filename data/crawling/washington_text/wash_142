To Colo. Auge Washington\Westmoreland Cty1/Dear Brother
[Fort Cumberland, Md., 14 May 1755]



I left home the 24th of last Month,2 and overtook the General at Frederick Town in Maryland: from whence we proceeded by slow Marches to this place; where, I fear, we shall remain some-time for want of Horses and Carriages to convey our Baggage &ca over the Mountains; but more especially for want of Forage; as it cannot be imagind that so many Horses as we require, will be subsisted without \a great deal./ erasure .3
We hear nothing particular from the Ohio only \except/ that the French are in hourly expectation of being joind by a large body of Indians; but I fancy they will find themselves so warmly attackd in other places, that it will \not be convenient for them to spare many./ erasure .4
[272]
I am treated with freedom \not inconsistent with/ and respect, by the General and his Family; so that I dont doubt \I have no doubt therefore/ but I shall spend my time very \more/ agreeably \than profitably during/ this\e/ Campaigne, tho not advantageously; as I conceive a little experience will be my chief reward. Please to give my Love to my Sister5 &ca. I am Dr Sir Yr most Affecte Brother
