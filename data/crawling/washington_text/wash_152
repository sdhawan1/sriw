To the SameDear Sir
[Williamsburg, 23 May 1755]



Since writg from Claybourns Ferry by the Late express,1 I arrivd at this place and \have/ met Mr Belfour; who, I believe, will be able with the assistance of the Govr and some other of his Fr[i]ends, to procure the money against \by/ the morning;2 which will enable me to set out \out at that time/ and I hope to get to \by tuesday to reach/ Winchester by Tuesday Night next;3 from whence, I shall proceed to the Camp with all possible dispatch.
As Colo. Hunter is gone to the Northward I coud get no positive answer concerning the further sum of Ten thousand pounds (which he was desird to send to Wills Creek) but Mr Belfour his partner thinks it may be depended upon.4 I shall, before I leave Town get his answer in writing, and deliver it safe \on my arrival/ Interim I am Sir
