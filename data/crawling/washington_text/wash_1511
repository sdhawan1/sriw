Captn Dagworthys Party returnd hither Yesterday, in consequence of Orders from Sir Jno. St clair forwarded by the Commanding Officer at Fort Frederick.2 I have directed him to finish a Bridge at this place, which I imagine he will effect by tomorrow Night; with his Tools I will next day send out a Party on General Braddocks Road, which I shall be able to reinforce when Colo. Mercer Returns.3
