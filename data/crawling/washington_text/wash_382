Sir
Fort Dunwiddie Novr 26. 1755



Before this no doubt you have heard of Capt. Bells Misfortune1 which keept me from Settling my recruiting Accts with him but left duplicates of these Accts when I marchd.2 It detaind me some days in expectation of hearing from him, which I did not, and hinderd me from Paying the men Agreeable to your order to the First of October, I was Able only to Join Capt. Hog with foure men Occasiond by desertion of the recruits on being Accquainted with Capt. Bells Affairs I am Sir Your Verry Humble Servt
