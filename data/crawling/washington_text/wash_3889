The General communicated to the Board a Discovery of a Correspondence carried on with the Enemy by Dr Church by Letter in Characters which was decyphered by the Revd Mr West & laid the sd Letters before the Members of this Council.1

October 4. 1775 The Council of War met.
Present as before.
Dr Church being sent for & shewn the Letter in Characters was askedWhether the sd Letter was written by himTo which he answered he believed it was.
He was then shewn the Explanation of sd Letterr as decyphered& asked whether it was a true one.
To which he answered in the Affirmative.
Dr Church then explained his Intentions in writing sd Letter as calculated to impress the Enemy with a strong Idea of our Strength & Situation in order to prevent an Attack at a Time when the Continental Army was in great Want of Ammunition & in Hopes of effecting some speedy Accommodation of the present Dispute & made solemn Asseverations of his Innocence.2
The General then asked the Opinion of the Council severally whether it did not appear that Dr Church had carried on a criminal Correspondence with the Enemyto which they unanimously answered in the Affirmative.
A Question was then proposed & discussd what were the proper Steps to be taken with Respect to him& after examining the Regulations of the Continental Army & particularly the Articles 28 & 51
It was determined from the Enormity of the Crime, & the very inadequate Punishment pointed out that it should be referrd to the General Congress for their special Direction & that in the mean Time he be closely confined, & no Person visit him but by special Direction.3
