Dr Sir
Mount Vernon Febry 15th 1776



your Letter of January 25th is come to ha[n]d1If I neglected to answer your Letter of the 26th Novmbr relative to my Wages, it was not intentionaly, I shoud be sorry that you shoud believe that I woud exact more of you now, than when you lived at Homehad you not offerd to pay me equal to what I had in any former year, I should not have murmerd, but chearfully endeavourd to have executed your Orders with regard to Hedgeing, Meadowing &c.,2 If my mind had been set upon Riches I very probably shoud have been trying every year that I have lived with you to get more of you, you will do me the justice to say that I have made no such attempt, God, forbid I shoud at this time do it, when you have it scarcely in your power to refuse me. I never expect to be Rich, my only Wish, or ambition has been to save so much out of my wages dureing the time I have served you and others, as woud be sufficient to purchase a small Farm in some part of the Country where the produce of it woud enable me to live, and give a Neighbour Beef, & Toddy, but that I now despair of ever accomplishg on this side the Allegana mountains for my employment is such that I cannot do you justice, and run about the Country to look where such a purchase may be madebut no more, my affairs are to myself & why shoud I pester you with them. you may be assured, my whole time and thoughts shall be devoted to your service, and as to any extraordinary care or trouble, I am at, I think nothing of it, for it is a maxim with me, that he who recieves the wages of another, hath no time which he, in right can call his own.
Mr Bailey demands 10 pr C. for Collectg your Rents I think it too much, told him you did not expect he woud offer to Ask more than 5 pr C., he said in these troublesome times, 10 was too little, desired I woud inform you what he said & seem to hint that few were better qualifyd for doing it than himselfIf I thought Mt Vernon woud stand where it does, when I returnd I woud take a Ride to them my selfperhaps if they had money I coud get some from them, it woud not take me more than a Week to go the rounds3 Inclosed is a Letter from Colo. Tayloe you will see by it, that he has directed me to Diliver the
[318]
Bonds to Colo. Peyton4 I have wrote to Colo. Peyton about themI shall when I see Cleveland be particular in my inquierys about your Land, I told him to write to you and mention all these things in his Letter, In my last I said he was gone to Battetourt and Fincastle Courts to get his worck Recorded, he is returnd, (altho I have not seen him) & I am told without doing his Businesshe went to Stanton in Augusta, and was there told, there woud be no Court in those Countys until marchI am at a loss how to settle with ClevelandI suppose his wages are to be paid altho you shoud not be Benefited by his Labour, for as he Acted for you, and by your Authority you must be answerable for his Bad bargains as well as the good ones. He told me he had given an Order upon You to the Commandg officer of the Fort, on Ac[coun]t of the Country, for 40 (for Beef) I have since understood, he killd a Beef belonging to the Fort and told his people to say it was a Buffeloe which they make Use of, He was taxd with so doing which he denied & calld upon his men to prove it was a Buffeloebut findg that the truth was likely to come out, by some minute inquierys which was about to be made, such as produceg the Horns &c.he ownd it, and plead necessatyThe Herd of Cattle out of which he killd these Beeves, coud not be found by the officer of the Fort, upon which he told Cleveland, if he did not pay him for the whole of them, he woud prosecute him, Cleveland thinkg he coud get them, agreed to pay for them, & gave this order above mentiond, but never got one of the Cattle afterQuery whether you are to pay that money or notAs to the Act of Assembly he never denied haveg it, but as I mentiond to you once before says, that he pointed out to you how much it was out of his power to procure an Order of Court appointg appraisers, & you agreed it was difficult & desired him if he coud do no Better, to have the men Swore before a majestratewhich he has done5John Broad is still alive but will not live many days longer Captn Marshall will not agree to Exchange his Land here for Adams in maryland he says that Land is quite out of his Way. Mr Wm Triplett says until the Bounds between you and him are assertaind he cannot see how the matter can be Finally Setled, for that John West is of opinion the present line between you is not the true linebut I will Still endeavour to bring the matter to a conclusion with him, he
[319]
promises to be here in a few DaysI intend to go to Dulany in a day or two & I will then fish out his sentiments with regard to the other matter6Mr Elzey tells me Adams Mortgage to you is recorded7Adams has been very pressg Lately for me to purchase that Land, he offers it to me for 900. but if I remember (for I once was on the Land) it is not worth so much moneythere being only 300 & some little more Acres in the TractMr John Stone wrote to me offering his Land upon the River joining to the Land you got of Adams, containg 360 Acres or there abouts for 30/ that Currency pr Acrehe says it will join yours to the Riverthat he can get 2500 Wt of Tobacco Rent for it &c.desires me to know of you, whether you will purchase it or not, he agrees the Land is poor but it is level & upon the River8I imagine we have thread Spun sufficient to make about 300 yds of Linnen, our people spin slow and are rather auchward. The Family in general are pretty wellI am very Sorry to hear Mr Custis is unwellI wish it was in my power to tell how the Family at Mount airy are but I have not heard from them.
