To Captain Henry Harrison. commanding at Edwardss.Sir,
[Winchester, 26 April 1756]



If you receive this before you leave Edwardss, I would have you proceed with a Detachment of yours, in your way to his, by Darby McIvers, who, with his Servant, &c. is killed by the Enemyand endeavour, if the Bearer can shew you their bodies, to have them Buried.1
You must endeavour to bring off the Cattle, &c. of the Inhabitants about there if possible, if you do not hear that the Enemy
[54]
are too strong in that Quarter for you to make an attempt of this kind. If you should get intelligence that they are; I would have you proceed here with your party, without regard to these ordersMake all the dispatch you possibly can to this place; as I wait your arrival with great impatience. Yours &c.

G:W.
April 26th 1756.
