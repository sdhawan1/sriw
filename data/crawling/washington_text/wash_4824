Sir
Head Quarters Cambridge 27th March 1776



I take this earliest opportunity to acquaint you that the Men of War and Transports with the Ministerial Troops sailed this afternoon from Nantasket Harbour. There is only a Man of War and two or three other armed Vessels now remaining there.1
In consequence of this movement I have ordered a Brigade to march to morrow morning for New York,2 and shall follow with the remainder of the Army as soon as I can receive certain information of the Fleet being clear of3 the Coast, and that we are in no further danger of their returning to attack us at a disadvantage. I shall leave a few Regiments at Boston to protect the Continental Stores, and to assist in fortifying the Town and Harbour agreeable to the directions that may be given by the
[544]
General Assembly of this Colony. I have the honor to be most respectfully Sir Your obedient humble Servant

G. Washington
