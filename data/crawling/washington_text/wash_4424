Sir
Camp at Roxbury Jan: 3d 1776



Capt. Kellog applies for Leave to take the Command of Capt. Hubbards Compy who is now in Canada. Capt. Kellog has behaved like a good Officer the past Campaign & is desirous of the above Favor only upon this Account: he imagines he can be very serviceable in gitting the Compy filld up; & is willing to resign the Command to Capt. Hubard when he returns from the Northward; if he desires to take it The Subaltern Officers are consenting to itI doubt not your Excellency will order that which is for the best.1 I am Your Excellencys most obedient Servant
