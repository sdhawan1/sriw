Sir
Camp in Cambridge March 18th 1776



The ministerial Troops having (yesterday) taken Their departure from Boston will, I presume, occasion the removal of the Continental Army to some distant part of the ContinentAnd as I find my Self in Such an Infirm State of health as renders me unable to bear the Fatigue of Such March as that Manvre will require, I cannot think it laudable to continue in the army & Pay of the Continent without being able to merit the Pay by my ServiceTherefore take leave to desire I may Resign the Command in the army I have been Honourd withAnd as I am at present unable to Travel, and being one hundred
[487]
& forty miles from my Family, I take leave also to request, That my Resignation may take place the eleventh Day of April next.1 I am your Excellencys most obedt humble Servant

Joseph Frye
