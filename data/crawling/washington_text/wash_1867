I received your letter of the 10th Inst.1 and have Sent you a Copy of Spencers Deed to Osborn the original Deed, is marked in the Record, delivered mutilated Wade.2 There are no Deeds Recorded in this mutilatedfice from Spencer to French or Manley, I have Searched for them very carefully, I apprehend they may have [been] purchassed from Some person that Spencer conveyed to, tho we cannot feind any Such conveyance.3
You have a true Copy of the courses of Harrisons land from the record, we examined them when Copied, and have again,
