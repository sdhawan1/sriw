My Lord
[OctoberNovember 1749]



I went Last Tuesday not knowing your Lordship had that very Day set out for Neavils1 to see whether you had any further Commands or directions to give concerning the Surveying of Cacapehon2 and as your Lordship was not at Home I was inform by Colo. G. Fairfax3 that you had not any Directions in Particular more than were given to the other Surveyors as your Lordship had mentioned  therefore have made bold to Proceed on General Directions from him as the Missing this Oppertunity of Good Weather may be of considerable Hindrance I shall Wait on your Lordship at Frederick Court in November4 to obey your further Pleasure and am my Lord &c.
