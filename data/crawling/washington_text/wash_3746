May it Please your Excellency.
Camp at Cambridge Septr 4th 1775



as I was appointed by the Genl Assembly of the Colony of Connecticutt Surgeons mate in Genl Putnams Regiment, and have fiathfully served therein, til the late Appointment of Doctr Church, by the Continental Congress, Superintendant of the Hospital of the American Army, by which the sole Care of the sick and Wounded hath devolved on him, which hath rendered the Appointment of Regimental Doctors, or at least more than one, Useless and of no service: and as I am sure it was not for the sake of Interest that induced me to Join the Army: but for the Benefit of the Regiment the good of my Cuntry and the noble Cause in which this Army & Continent are now ingaged
[413]
I would therefore humbly beseech your Excellency to discharge me from any future Attendence on said Regiment,1 which is the Prayer of your Excellencys most Obedt Humble Servt
