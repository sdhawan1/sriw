Dear Sir.
Williamsburg 28th Augt 1756



Since writing of the within Letter Ive prevaild with myself & Colo. Digges to wait on the Governour & represented Mr Robertss Case to him;1 he left the Matter entirely to us & agreed that he might be discharged if We could procure another Man to go up in his Room; this Im afraid will not be in our Power; We have however passd our Words that Roberts shall surrender himself to you, to be disposed of as you think proper. If you
[379]
cant discharge him without having another Man in his Stead & cant employ him in some such Office as Ive mentioned in my Letter I would to serve the poor young Man go as far as five or six Pounds in Hiring a Man in his Room, tho I imagine one may be got cheaper, & a more able Man for a Soldier too, as he will be discharged by the Act of Assembly the first of December.2 If the young Man should Want a few Necessaries, I will be Security for such as you think he cant well do without. I am prompted to say thus much out of Regard to the Young Man & by no other Motive: When his Father dies he will have a pretty good Estate independent of wt he may think fit to give him, & make no Doubt but that, when he is able he will repay me Whatever I advance for him. I heartily Wish I could contribute to make your Office more agreeable to you than it seems to be as I shall be always well pleased to shew with how3 much Regard I am, Dr Sir, Yr affte humble Servt

Robt C. Nicholas
