[17491750]




From your bright sparkling Eyes, I was undone;
Rays, you have, more transparent than the sun,
Amidst its glory in the rising Day,
None can you equal in your bright arrays;
Constant in your calm and unspotted Mind;
Equal to all, but will to none Prove kind,
So knowing, seldom one so Young, youl Find.
Ah! woes me, that I should Love and conceal,
Long have I wishd, but never dare reveal,
Even though severely Loves Pains I feel;
Xerxes that great, wast free from Cupids Dart,
And all the greatest Heroes, felt the smart.
