Sir
Williamsburg Septr 30th 1756



Last Night I recd a Letter dated the 23d from Alexaa not signd, but by its purport I believe it from YouJenkinss delay prevents laying any Thing before the Assembly as they were prorogued the Morning he arrivd1I am of Opinion You may enforce the Articles of War the same as in the British Establishmt that with tenderness as the Exigency of Affairs may require; & tho no Crimes but Mutiny & Desertion are mentiond in the Act of Assembly, yet other lesser Crimes are to be punishd by a Court Martial, or the Commanding Officer agreeable to Act of Parliament.
You have frequently complaind to me of the Situation &ca of Fort Cumberland, & I have wrote You how disagreeable it was to me to give up any Place of strength, as it woud raise the Spirits of the Enemy & at same time suspect us to be in fear of them; & therefore if that Place coud be sustaind with Safety till Lord Loudoun gives Orders thereon I shoud be glad, but as You are on the Spot & You think it very prejudicial to the Service, to keep that Fortress, I desire You may call a Council of Officers & consult whether the most adviseable to keep it, or demolish it.2 if the last You must take care to have all the Ammunition &ca brought to Winchester, & destroy every Thing You may conceive can be of any Service to the Enemy; this Affair is now left to the Determination of a Council of Officers, & I desire You to be very explicit in Your Arguments on the Head as they must be laid before Ld Loudoun. I was always averse to small Garrisons on our Frontiers, as they in course divide our Men into small Parties; but You know that the Assembly were so fond of them that they passd a Law for that purport, & I cannot at present alter that Determination. If Jenkins had returnd to my expectation, some Thing of what You offer shoud have been laid before the Assembly.
You know the Difficulty of raising of Men here, Lord Loudoun, by Orders from His M[ajest]y had directed raising of Men here to help to compleat his Regiment of Royal Americans, the Assembly voted Money for that Service,3 but where to get the Men I know not, tho several Persons are now employd
[425]
in several Parts of the Cotry on that Service There are no Rangers now in Pay as the Fund is exhausted that was voted for that Ser[vice]. One Third of the Militia from Augusta & some from the other Counties Contiguous have been orderd out for protectn of the Front[ier]s but they are such a dastardly set of People that I am convincd they do not do their Duty4 which is the reason of the late Invasion there, they have neither Courage, Spirits or Conduct.
I have frequently wrote about the tipling-Houses at Winchester & desird the Court to suppress them, if they do not, when Your Fort is finishd You must do it of Yourself for the Service of the GarrisonA Chaplain for the Regiment I have recommended to the Commissary to get one,5 but he cannot prevail with any Person to accept of it, I shall again press it to him.
All I can do cannot prevent the People entertaining & protecting of Deserters, & if properly informd some of the Magistrates are guilty.6 its a growing Evil & too generalI applied for a short Law to prevent driving of Cattle out of the Colony but the Majority of the House was against itJenkins shoud be paid & Chargd in Your Acct of Contingencies, surely the Comittee cannot expect me to pay itI suppose You will think it necessary to have some Person to ride from this to You, with Acct of the Occurrences & its a matter indifferent who the Person is.
You are to send me a distinct List of Your Regiment every Officers Appointment & Pay, or any other Allowances they may have with the Number of Men in each Company signd by You & the other Field Officers, to be transmitted to the Earl of Loudoun, the sooner You supply me with this the better.
The Invasion in Augusta I had Acct of some time ago, & gave such Directions as I thought proper on the Occasion, but very little Dependence is to be put in the Militia. The Copy of a Letter from Wm Armstrong brings agreeable News, if confirmd; I suppose the Detachment mentiond in that Letter was from Pensylvania.7
The Cherokee Indians are not yet come in, but daily expected, & its said there will be 400 of them; I wish they were now in Augusta, & if they with some of our Forces woud proceed to the Indian Towns I think8 might be of much Service. I
[426]
cannot account for their Delay in coming, only that naturally they are lazy & must be humourd as to their slow marching.9
I am much hurried & therefore remain Sir Yr h. Se.
