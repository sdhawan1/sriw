Cleveland says he is of no great Value, as there is a good Deal of money Circulating now, in West Augusta I would sell him, was I in your placeyou may depend I shall not diliver Mercers Bonds to any person but Colo. Tayloe or his order. it appears to me that Tayloe does not intend to give him self any Trouble about them5As to Colo. Fairfaxes Bonds, no person has ever applyd for them altho I have repeatedly wrote to Peyton & Willis about them.6 Lord Fairfax I am told is at present pretty well, it was thought some time this winter that he coud not live longI shall do as you direct in case of his Death7I told you in a former Letter I had got Adams Negroethe Fellow says he had much rather be sold in Maryland than live in Virginiaand as you seem willing to sell him, if any of those people who you have money to pay on Ac[coun]t of Adams will take him, I shall let them have him.8
