CElestial choir! enthrond in realms of light,
Columbias scenes of glorious toils I write.
While freedoms cause her anxious breast alarms,
She flashes dreadful in refulgent arms.
See mother earth her offsprings fate bemoan,
And nations gaze at scenes before unknown!
See the bright beams of heavens revolving light
Involved in sorrows and the veil of night!
[243]
The goddess comes, she moves divinely fair,
Olive and laurel binds her golden hair:
Wherever shines this native of the skies,
Unnumberd charms and recent graces rise.
Muse! bow propitious while my pen relates
How pour her armies through a thousand gates:
As when Eolus heavens fair face deforms,
Enwrappd in tempest and a night of storms;
Astonishd ocean feels the wild uproar,
The refluent surges beat the sounding shore;
Or thick as leaves in Autumns golden reign,
Such, and so many, moves the warriors train.
In bright array they seek the work of war,
Where high unfurld the ensign waves in air.
Shall I to Washington their praise recite?
Enough thou knowst them in the fields of fight.
Thee, first in place and honours,we demand
The grace and glory of thy martial band.
Famd for thy valour, for thy virtues more,
Hear every tongue thy guardian aid implore!
One century scarce performd its destined round,
When Gallic powers Columbias fury found;
And so may you, whoever dares disgrace
The land of freedoms heaven-defended race!
Fixd are the eyes of nations on the scales,
For in their hopes Columbias arm prevails.
Anon Britannia droops the pensive head,
While round increase the rising hills of dead.
Ah! cruel blindness to Columbias state!
Lament thy thirst of boundless power too late.
Proceed, great chief, with virtue on thy side,
Thy evry action let the goddess guide.
A crown, a mansion, and a throne that shine,
With gold unfading, Washington! be thine.
