The Congress having this Day made several Promotions in the Army of the United Colonies, and established some Rules for the future Direction of the Deputy Commissaries general, Deputy Quarter Master General &c. I do myself the Pleasure to enclose you a Copy of the same.1
I have delivered Col. Reed his Commission, and have sent Mr Whitecom Mr Mercer, and Mr Moyland theirs.2
Should you stand in Need of any more blank Commissions, they shall be immediately forwarded, on your letting me know it. I entirely forgot to make Enquiry into the Matter while you was in this City.
Having Nothing further in Charge from Congress at this Time, I beg Leave to assure you that I am, with the greatest Respect and Esteem, Sir your most obedt and very hble Sevt
