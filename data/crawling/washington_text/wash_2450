Dear Sir
Towlston July the 30th 1768



Since I wrote to You last1 I have received a Letter from Dr Savage wherein he says that his Wife acknowledges that she had once in a discontented Mood expressed a Dislike to parting with the Bond, but that she fully convinced me at our last meeting of her earnest desire to relinquish it: At the same time Mrs Savage also wrote to me begging a thousand pardons of You & me for the trouble she had given us, and mentions her Intention of going to Ireland immediately, and desires the Bond may be given up. I am to acknowledge Your favor of the 25th and entirely agree with You in SentimentsI have thought proper to mention the contents of the two last Letters tho I dont know that it can make any Alteration in our proceedings to obtain the Sum due.2 I remain Dr sir Your most obedt Servt
