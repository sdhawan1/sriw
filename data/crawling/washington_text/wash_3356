Dear Sir
Alexandria Feby 26. 1775



Your favor of the 24 I received,1 and having Examined the Record furnished by Mr Wagener, I find it is so full, and contains so clear a state of mutilated proceedings, which have been had in the Cause, from the Original Writ, down to the Execution & Sheriffs Return thereupon, that I cannot say any thing that will give you or Mr Pendleton a clearer Idea or conception of the matter: he will discover from the Extraordinary motion made about Entering Special Bail when the suit was first called the Errors filed upon obtaining a Verdict to arrest the Judgement, & finally the Injunction in Chancery, that the Doctor and his Counsel have practised every possible mutilatedeuvre to defer the payment of the money which Justice & Generosity call upon him mutilateddly for.2 Mr Pendleton will procure from the Secretaries Office a Copy of his Bill in order to have your & Mr Fairfaxs Answer drawn which I flatter myself will do away every mutilatedarge of Equity he may have Suggested, I am sure It will, for in this case he can have none.3 I am D. Sir with great regard Your obligd Servt

Rob. H. Harrison


P.S. Should the Answer be drawn here It will be necessary to have these Proceedings. Yrs R.H.H.
