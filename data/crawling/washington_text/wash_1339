To The President
Honble Sir,Mount-Vernon, the 20th February, 1758.
I set out for Williamsburgh the day after the date of my letter by Jenkins; but found I was unable to proceed, my fever and pain encreasing upon me to an high degree, and the Physicians assured me, that I might endanger my life in prosecuting the journey.1 In consequence of this advice, I returned back to this place again, and informed your Honor of the reason of my detention by the Post, whom I met with on the road, and who I have since understood, never lodged my letter in the Post-Office at Fredericksburgh;2 which is the cause of my writing this second one to the same purport. Whenever I shall be sufficiently able to attempt the journey again, I can not say: but shall delay no time after I am in a condition to perform it. I am your Honors &c.

G:W.
