[Winchester, 13 May 1756]



May 13thAn express came from Colo. Peyton informg that a Sergt & 14 Men deserted last Night from him at Pariss Fort1 and desireing a Reinforcement I was obligd to Countermand the Orders to the King George Militia & to, then send them to join him with orders to remain in Ashbys Fort and they accordingly Marchd 29 in number under Lieutt Nugent the rest were Sick & deserted.2 and this N, 4 out of the 29 also Marchd off.3
Many complaints from the Officers of Militia abt the insufficiency of the allowance of Provisions for their Men (tho. they have a 1 lb. of Meat and the like quantity of flour pr day wch is the same that the Soldrs have) obligd me to order the Comy to deliver the Officers allowance to the Private Men in order to appease their clamours this I did to prevent increasing the allowance & settg bad examples. but this proveing insufft also I was obligd to order the allow[anc]e to be increased to 1 of Flour & as much flesh pr Day.
