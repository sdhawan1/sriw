Dr General
New York Febry the 19th 1776



I am extremely happy that there is any open[ing] for a more comfortable establishment for poor Palfry than his presentHe is a valuable and capable Man, and the pittance of a simple Aid de Campship is wretched for a Man who has a family to supporton this principle and in obedience to your commands I shall send him to Head Quarters without delay1I must at the same time confess that the loss will be irreparable to me, particularly if I am detachd to Canada of which there is the greatest probability, as I have receivd Letters from divers Members of the Congress expressing their wishes that I shoud be employd in that departmentMessrs Griffin and Byrd are very good young Men, but pretty much in the predicament of your BaylerThey can ride, understand and deliver verbal ordersbut you might as well set them the task of translating an Arabick or Irish Manuscript as expect that They shoud in half a day copy a half sheet of ordershowever I must bustle through the difficulties and not keep Palfrey out of the channel of a better provision, if I go to Canada I suppose I shall be allowd Secretaries, one French and one EnglishI do not see how it is possible to manage matters with lessa propos My Dr General, if I find this is to be my province, shall you take it ill, if I apply for one of my two Brigadiers either Green or Sullivan? it is a pleasure to have some Officer about us in whom We can place confidence. The Ships of War which were here have been frightend awaythe Asia lies betwixt Nuttens and Bedloes Island2the Dutchess of Gordon with his Excellency Governor Tryon is under her sternthe Phnix is stationd a league below the narrowsthe Mercury and General Clinton must inevitably fall into the hands of our Fleet, unless They are fast asleepWe have taken strong hold of Hell Gateso that the passage betwixt Long Island and the Continent is absolutely blockd up to the EnemyI wait for some more force to prepare a Post or retrenchd Encampment on long Island opposite to the City for three thoushend Menthis is I think a capital objectfor shoud the Enemy take possession of N. York when Long Island is in our handsThey will find it almost impossible

to subsistthe Jerseys are too well mannd, and Connecticut you know will not furnish them with any thingwhat to do with the City, I own puzzles me, it is so encircled with deep navigable water, that whoever commands the Sea must command the Towntomorrow I shall begin to dismantle that part of the Fort next the Town to prevent its being converted into a CitadelI shall barrier the principal Streets, and at least if I cannot make it a Continental Garrison, it shall be a disputable field of Battleinclosd I send you a return of the good and indifferent pieces of Cannon3the number of the bad those I mean totally unfit for serviceare I believe about sixtyas no Commissary of Stores has been appointed untill this instant it is impossible to give you a return of the other stores by this Post, but you shall have it by the next4Ld Stirling is a great acquisitionHe is a most zealous active and accurate Officera Capt. of a Ship from Cadiz, who is a very intelligent Person tells us that Ld Howe and Capt. Barrington or Admiral Barrington are appointed Commissioners to propose terms to the Congressthis He had from the Consul Hardy5what damnd fools the Ministry are! how does your recruiting go on for the standing Army? be so good as to tell Gates to whom I shall write by the next Post that Mr Nourse inclosd no letters for him6if little Eustace is not provided for in your Army and I shoud go to Canada, I think He had better be sent to me and I will consign him to his Uncle7I am got quit of my gout and fever but remain extremely weak and tenderGod preserve You My Dr General, from all disorders, at least untill We have trampled Satan under our feetMy love to Mrs Washington and all the Ladiesadieu, Yours Most faithfully
