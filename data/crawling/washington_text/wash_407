The Servants that these Liverys are intended for, are 5 feet 9 Ins. and 5f. 4 In. high and proportionably made. I woud have you choose the livery by our Arms; only, as the Field of the Arms is white. I think the Cloaths had better not be quite so. but nearly likely the inclosd. The Trimmings and Facings of Scarlet, and a Scarlet Waistcoat the cloath of wch to be 12/6 pr yd. If Livery Lace is not quite disusd, I shoud be glad to have these Cloaths Laced. I like that fashion best. and two Silver lacd Hats for the above Ly.
