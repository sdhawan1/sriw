ReferenceAbove the Mouth of Shan[andoa]h there is but one fall and that is smooth and shallow which prevents Craft from passing at all timesAbt  Mile below is the place Esteemd the most difficult It runs exceeding swift for wch reason it is calld the spout and the bottom being very Rocky occasions rough water which will prevent small Canoes ever passing as ours that was large had like to have filldThere continues for near three Miles Rocky & unevenWater in which dist[anc]e and towards the latter end there is two other Falls one swift & ugly but when the River is higher than ordinary a passage may be had r[oun]d a small Islandwhich passage may be greatly improvedThere is also a passage at the spout which vessels may, and have been hald up by near the shoar, and this may yet be improvedAbt 12 Miles below this is another Fall but very easy and passable and abt 2 Miles from that is a cluster of small Islands with many Rocks and swift water which renders the passage somewhat precarious: from this to the Seneca Fall1 is a fine smooth even Water as can be desird The Seneca Fall is easily passd in two places and Canoes may continue within two Miles of the Great Falls2 but further it is not possible therefore the expence and trouble of going up Seneca Falls will not answer the Charges as all Carriages are obligd to pass difficult Bridge3 from whence it is but 8 Miles to the Landing place at Mr Barnes Quarter at the Sugerlands and is 5 Miles to any Landing below the aforesd Falls of Seneca.4
