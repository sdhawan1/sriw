Dear Washington
July 26th 1755



The dismal Defeat of our Forces by such a handful of Men gives me very great Concern, as also for the Death of the Genl & so many brave Officers entirely owing to the dastardly Spirit of the private Men their Panick I suppose made them deaf to all Commands & in course was the Bane of all our Misfortunes[.] The train of Artillery being in the Enemys Possessn is a monstrous Misfortune; however I was glad to receive Yr Letr1 & that You came safe off witht any Wound after Yr gallant Behavr on which I congratulate You & thank You for the Acct You gave me of the Engagemt but I suppose You cd not tell the Numbr of the Enemy that were killed2But pray Sr wth the Numbr of Men remaing is there no Possibility of doing somethg the other Side of the Mounts. before the Winter MonthsI have wrote Colo. Dunbar on this head3 & if the private Men have got over their Panick I think they may do a good deal as I suppose many of the Fr. will immediately go up the River Ohio as they will not expect any Attack from this so soon after the late Defeat. Pray write me Yr Opinion thereon. I have calld the Assembly & do not doubt of their concuring with me in any Thg reasonable for the Service.4 I have orderd three Compas. of Rangers to the Frontiers:5 but surely You must Mistake. Colo. Dunbar will not march to Winter Qrs in the Middle of Sumer, & leave the Frontiers of his Majestys Colonies open witht proper Fortificats. & exposd to the Invasions of the Enemy, no! he is a better Officer & I have a different Opinion of himI shall wait wth Impatience an Answer to my Letr to him by this ExpsI thank You for the List of Officers killd & Wounded,6 it gives me much Concern to observe so many brave Men in a manner Murderd for defect of the private Mens not doing their Duty. I sincerely wish You Health & Happiness & am with great Respect Sr Yr o. h. S.
