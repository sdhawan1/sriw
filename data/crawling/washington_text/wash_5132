troubling you. I have tried, I have pursued every measure my Judgemt lead to without being able to procure a sufficient quantity, nor have I any power to apply to but you, from which I can promise myself the least prospect of Success.
I woud also take the liberty of praying your endeavours to procure a Quantity of Intrenching Tools, Viz. Spades & Shovels, as our Operations goe on much slower than they woud, If we had more of them, which at a crisis like this is exceedingly alarming, when the Utmost labor & Industry will not more than complete the necessary Works of defence by the Time the Enemy may attempt an InvasionThe Qur Mr assures me that he has taken every possible method in his power to get them but without success, which is the reason of my requesting an exertion of your Interest.2 I am &c.

G.W.
