I only Desire to have my outsets made Good and Some proper allowance for the Expence of my Time in the affair which I apprehend the Six Shillings will Scarcely Doowherefore I would intreat the favour of your Excellencys Laying the inclosed before the Honorble House To Whome it is Directed and use your influence in Geeting The Same allowed if your Excellency Shall apprehend the Same to be Consistent with Reason & not injurious To the publick Cause for which we are So justly Contendingwith all possible Regards I Subscrib mySelf your Excellencys most obedient and very Humble Servant
