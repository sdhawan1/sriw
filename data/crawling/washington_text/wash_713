The Reason for this dispositionto guard the Inhabitants that still remaindto secure their grain and stock to help in with their Harvest & to be contiguous to the People & to each other that they might unite occasionally and go in quest of the Enemy. they all marchd this day to their new appd Stations: Besides the Militia Offrs that were sent after the Deserters I orderd out one from the Regt with a party of 8 or 10 Men mounted7 to go in pursuit of them.
Our Strength being so much reducd by the number of Deserters that had gone off that I im[mediatel]y upon the r[eceip]t of Ashbys & illegible8 dispatchd an express to the Colos. Barrat Talliaferro & Slaughter who were the last that had left this place ordering them to return with their Men.9
In the Eveng the Colos. Barrat & Tallia. returnd without any men informg me that many of theirs had taken different roads homewards and that those who were with Colo. Talliaferro upon hearg that they were orderd back chargd their pieces & cond their march towards their County in defiance of the Offrs.
