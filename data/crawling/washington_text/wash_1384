Sir
Fort Frederick [Md.] 27th April 1758



I am sent here by Sr John St Clair to repair the Roads &c. on both Sides of the Potowmack; to forward which Service he told me he had ordered 200 of the Virginia Troops to take Post at Enochs: whenever this is done youll please to let me know & I shall be ready to attend them.1
Lieut. Shelby, who is employd to buy Forrage, has contracted for some Oats & Indian Corn to be delivered at Capt. Catons on your Side of the Potowmack.2 As it may be a Week or ten Days before he can send for it, & as he thinks it a dangerous Place he desired I would mention it to you; being assured that, if you think it necessary, you will order a small Guard there from Pattersons Fort or elswhere. I am, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servt

T. Basset Engineer
