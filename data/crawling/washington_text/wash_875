The President produced to the Council Orders from Colo. Washington of the 5th & 7th of August1 that the President & the two remaining Companys are to be disposed of in the most eligible manner for the protection of the Inhabitants above the Trough, & as the Militia Stationed upon the Branch are determined to leave their Stations directly, We judging the Welfare of our Country requires that as many of the Inhabitants as possible remain on the Branch, which without protection it will be impossible to Detain.
It is therefore the opinion of the Council that the Forces Detached from the Regiment and now upon the Branch be Stationed at the Forts occupied by the Militia, & that without a further Supply of Men it will be impracticable to proceed in building the Chain of Forts Ordered. We are likewise Informed that the upper Inhabitants that is those twenty miles above Capt. Waggeners upper Fort is without a Mill, & that neither meal or flour can be had without sending a Detachment at least twenty Miles for it, so that the whole except Capt. Bells Company remains here till further Orders.2
