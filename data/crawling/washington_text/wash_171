To Govr Innis of Fort CumberlandDear Sir
[Scalping Camp, Pa., 2 July 1755]



I shoud take it infinitely kind, if you wd be good enough to dispatch, by the first safe oppertunitys \after they come to hand/ any Letterss that you
[331]
may receive either to, or from me; for I have been greatly surprisd \and disappointed/ at not r[e]ceiveing any Letters from my Friends since I came out; and must impute it to miscarriage, somewhere, for I am certain it cannot be owing \altogether/ to their not writing.
I have been excessively ill, but am now recovering from violent Fevers & Pains, of wch my disorder consisted.
The Doctors forbid my\e to/ writing,1 as very injurious to my health, therefore I cannot have the pleasure of giving you a particular acct of our situation &ca, but I shall refer you to Mr Caton,2 who has had an oppertunity of seeing the whole. \& judging for himself./ I am Yr most Obt Servt
