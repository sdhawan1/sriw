Sir,
Ft Cumberland [Md.] Sepr 27th 1755



This morning One Packton a Hunter came in quite Spent, being pursued by Indians in Sight of our Sentrys, and having been chasd five days from the grounds about the Extremity of the Road upon which the Pensylvanians were Employd. The Savages pursued him so close, that the Sentry at the Magazine heard him hollow; upon which a party of The Guard was detached, and brought him in. The Man is well known by Several in the Garrison, having hunted for them when they Coverd the Road-Cutters.
A party of Volunteers were ordered out, under command of Capt. Savage to reconnoitre the Bottom of Wills Creek. They Rousd three Indians and fired at them but Soon lost Sight of them. We Continue Alert, and want men much. The Indians discover our Parties by the Tract of their Shoes, It would be a good thing to have Shoe-packs or Moccosons1 for the Scouts. I am with Respect Sir, Your most Obt huble Sert
