[173]
suppose you do not intend it for one, woud have lookd more Uniform in its outward appearance, to have had one Door in the midle as the Kitchen opposite has & the other in the Gable End, which might have been done by makg the Room next the great House the Breadth of the Door smaller than the Other, if it is not designd for a Wash House, it woud have been large enough for any other purpose, & shoud there be a coverd way from that End of the Great House to it as well as there is from the Other End to the Kitchen a Gable End door woud have lookd bestthe House is now raised, I mentioned something of this in a former letter,6 I shall leave the Front part of it undone untill I hear from you about it, & shoud you think proper to alter itwe can then do itI wrote to you abt Jennifer Adams Land, What was to be done with it, if to be rented & how, whether altogether or in parselsif you had deeds for it or not & if there is no money to be paidI was yesterday told by a man Who came here to rent it, that Adams had been sellg in the Course of this Summer, all the timber he was able to get off it.7 I told you in my last that we had nearly Completed our tumbling Dam, & that I believed much Stronger than before, when I wrote it was Raing which Continued for the two followg days with Such Violence, that it carried away every thing almost that we had done, & broke the Race in several other places that the Fresh before did not, the reason why the dam gave way was owing to the flat forum [platform] on which the water falls not being planked, which was all that we had to do, towards compleatg the worck, we are again mendg it & shall if no more such Rains come, have it finishd this week comeg inthe Coopers have been ever since Hay time upon the Mill Race, the Whole worck almost of the Tumbling Dam with the Breaches made in the Race has been done by them, the Miller8 with themTom tendg the Mill. I think since the 12th of Augst or thereabouts we have had more Rain than I ever see fall in the timethe ground has been almost the whole time too wet to plow, we are not yet done sewg Wheat nor shall not be, for a Fortnight to come owing to the wetI am at a loss how to proceed, whether to Grind up our Wheat or notI am told by Bennett Jenkins (who came here to recieve his money) which he applyd for in Novmbr last you then told him he says that you did not chuse to
