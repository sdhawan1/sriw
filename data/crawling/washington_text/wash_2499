To the Right Honble Norborne Baron de Botetourt his Majestys Lieutenant and Governor General of Virginia and Vice Admirel of the same and the rest of the Judges of the General Court in Chancery.
The Petition of George Washington Esquire humbly sheweth
That in Right of his wife Martha late the Widow of Daniel Custis Esqr., he is siezd and possessed among other things, of a Tract of Land containing about 1000 acres situate near the City of Williamsburg on which are two Plantations1 mutilated 10 or 12 Acres of Meadow Ground mutilated and about mutilated and about 100 Acres of Marsh with a valuable Water Grist Mill thereon which has upon an average of Seven years past Ernd the Sum of 97.15.10 nett profit and will probably yield more hereafter, as she has been rebuilt within these four years and a Second pair of Stones added (for before she had but one pair) since which the profits for the three Last years have averaged 119.4.0.
That your Petitioner living a great distance from these Lands, and having fresh Lands of his own2 which he can Work his Slaves on to greater advantage and more immediately under his own Eye hath come to a resolution to withdraw his slaves from
[196]
the said Dower Lands and to Rent out the same with the Grist Mill thereon, at an Annual Rent.
That your Petitioner conceives it will be greatly to the advantage of John Parke Custis the Son and heir of the said Danl Custis to Rent the said Lands and Mill of your Petitioner for the following among other Reasons.
FirstThat by adding the said mutilated slaves may be withdrawn from other Plantations mutilated greater advantages in point of profit as well as mutilated his Lands.
Secondly The Meadow mutilated enable him to raise greater Stocks and increase his Crops not only upon the Plantations on the Dower Lands but mutilateding.
Thirdly Your Petitioner has hitherto contented himself with the use of the two Plantations without cutting down any Wood, except for firewood & Rails To have the 1000 acres laid offwhich when done your Petitioner is satisfied would take in the mutilated part of the old Plantation hitherto occupied by the heir and subject him to great Inconvenience;3 and at the same time if your Petitioner was to lay the Lands off into small mutilated4 as he mutilated is able to mutilated it, the Wood Lands woud be Cut down and the Heir injurd in these particulars.
Upon these Considerations your Petitioner is mutilated to take from the heir the Annual Rent of 150 for the said Lands and Mill which he thinks below the real value: but as the said Heir mutilated Infant and your Petitioner his Guardian he does not choose to risque the Censure of having a view to his own Interest by Proceeding in that manner without the approbation of this Honble Court by whom he was appointed Guardian.
He therefore humbly submits the same to their consideration and prays their direction in the Premises.5
