Dumfries Sept. 3: 1754



Mr Wright returnd from Wmsburgh on Monday night,1 & would have immediatly have Waited on You, but I knew Your Good nature, & hatred of Ceremony will excuse it, as he had no Letters for You, or indeed to any others tho. he called on both the Colo. Fairfaxs for their Commds[.] He was kindly recd by the Governr, Who told him there Coud be nothing done till the rising of the assembly, when he Shoud be rememberd, & is the Case with all those, who were in waiting for Comissns; I am very Sensible the kind reception Mr Wright met with, is chiefly owing to your kind & generous Recomendation, which justly challenges his, & my gratefull acknowledgements: I hope he
[200]
will be able to Shew, it was not a Misplacd Generosity, but that a Commissn is only the necessary reward of Merit.2
Mr Wright brings nothing more remarkable than that the assembly has Voted 20.000 to be raisd by a poll tax of 5/2/ whereof to be paid in Decr, & the other 3/ or 30 lb. Tobo to be paid in June next. We Cant tell how it is to be applyd, Or by Whom Disposd. The assembly twas thought woud rise this day.3
I Shoud be glad to know Mrs Fairfax is quite recoverd, & that the Ladys are as you wish them to bepay my acceptable Complimts to the Ladys & Gent. of the regimt & amusque ad: as far as you please Dr Colo. Yr Most Obligd & Obedt Servt

Its said Letters from the Atty indicate some hope of yet succeeding in having the pistole affair determined [in] favr of the Country, & that he is establisd in his attorneys place. Its thought this favourable turn of his affairs is owing to the alacrity with which the assembly Voted the 10.000 as appeard by the Journals of the House Sent to Brittain.4
