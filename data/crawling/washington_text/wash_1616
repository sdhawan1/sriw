Dear Sir
Alexandria 23d Augt 1758



I am no less honourd than entertaind by your kind Letter of the 20th which has had a speedy passage hither1and gives me the wishd for intelligence of Your good Health, amid all your Anxieties, and TroublesMay it long continue& improve with a full enjoyment of all your wisheswhether in the Active attempts to Libertyand Honouror in the Passive Paths of Virtue, Peace and Pleasure.
You have a large share of Sympathy from mecoud it avail to change the Situation of Affairsor my ineffectual Wishes add any thing to the Service of my Countrywhich, now more than ever calls aloud For ReddressIn vain does your Generous Zeal, oppose the Torrent of headstrong prejudice or attempt to clear the Mists of Mistaken Partiesit has long been the luckless fate of Virginia, to fall a Victim to the Views of her Crafty Nighboursand Yield her honest efforts to promote their common interestat the expence of much Blood and Treasurewhile her Sincerity Justified her MeasuresWe now, can only bewaill that Blindnessand wish for happier timeswhich seem at so remote a distancethat it is rather to be wishd than expected.
Your kind detail of the Delays and disapointments that attend You, are extremely acceptableand we all acknowledge the favourCoud it suit your Leisure to give us an Account of the Roads from Phila. to Rays Townthence to Du Quesnetheir

distanceand how passable for Carriages&c.a better notion can be formd of this Surprising follywhen laid in Contrast to the old RoadsA particular list of Your Army would likewise oblidgeand what other intelligence you are pleasd to Communicateas we shall be better Judges of the Injustice offerd by the Pensilvanianswho are all in all.
To drop the dull topick of Politicksand touch the subject of Social entertainmentwoud require a readier genius, to dress the insipid Occurancies so as to Yield you any degree of Satisfactionbut to take them according to your own ArrangemtLove, reigns with gentle swayand rarely in this Age, warms the heart beyond the common degree of Fondnesshence, this defficiency of Romantick LoversKnight Errants&c. in short his influence is Seldom seen, till Lust bring to light, his sly insinuationsHow to account for this Coolness towards ConjugationI must leave you to be informd by the learndHowever, as an exception I hear Charles Eskridgeintends to Batter down the Virgin Gates of Miss Guleys Garrison in a little time[.] The Surrender being suspended till Monsr Ramsay the Commandantconsent to the Terms of CapitulationCharless Colo. vizt Cle resists the scheme with fruitless arguments2I know none with Childyou care much for but Some, who wish for itCoud the Villainous fellow Shame be dispensed withI Am almost induced to believe Our Friend B. Fairfax has some thoughts of Softening his Austerity in the Arms of some fair Nymphcoud he reconcile the Toying, Triffling, Billing, Sports of Loveto the Solemnity and Gravity of his DeportmentAmusements, & Joys unbecoming the Dignity of his Philosophic Tempertho I cant think he has any inherent aversion to what Some estime the end of Creation.3
I am hurried to Conclude because Cowper who brout me Yours carries this to Winchester& waites for meI have resolved on paying a Visit to my native Country, & may probably take the first Occasion in 3 Weeks or a Month hencehowever shall do my self the pleasure of Writing You before I go& give you a Direction for methat when it shall please you to honour me wt. a LetterI may not suffer a disapointment by miscarriageI am not resolved to continue at home but therehere, or Whereever Fortune fixes meI Am extreamely Yours
[415]
in every respectas in Duty I ought& always will be Dear Sir Your Very Much Oblidged & Obedt Hume Servt
