not to return;2 upon which I orderd a Court of enquiry & Inclose you a Copy of its Proceedings3 from which & various hints I receivd in different Channels concluded it possible to make further Discoveries by getting Hamiltons House and those of his intimates Searchd, the preparative steps thereto I conducted wt. the utmost secrecy & after a number of Warrants were Signd by Justice Speake the only Constable in Town (Thos Wood) refusd to act nor was one in Town would serve his Country in that Office till Mr Woodrow very generously accepted & with indefaticable assiduity executed it, he accompanied by several Officers spent the whole night in searching many of the Houses in Town & some in its Neighbourhood and several things belonging to the Regiment were found;4 those in whose possession the things were found was this day brought before the Justices Swearingin, Linsey & Speake who Bound them over to the next Court as they were at a loss how to act for want of the Laws relative thereto Inclosd is a Copy of their proceedgs.5 Lieut. Buckner and the Adjutant went off last night to Kays Ferry where its said some things are conceald but are not yet returnd.6
As theres no Quarter Masr and the Stores in the greatest Confusion I judgd it expedient to postpone their removal till your further orders.
Twenty Cherrokee Warriours and a Squaw arrivd here this Evening I heard of their coming last Sunday and desird Mr Gist to acquaint his Father by Express of it which he says he did but no accots from the Father[.] The few Indians that were here before went out to meet the 20 just arrivd, they had some Conversation together, none of them would come into Town but Encampd on a rising near it. Burras says that they told him Capn Gist stays away designedly and thinks the Cherrokees not good.7
