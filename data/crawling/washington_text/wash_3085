Dear Sir
1774 January 1



There is a deed of gift from your Lady, for several Slaves, to her Brother Bartholomew Dandridge, in Trust, for the Joint use
[434]
of her decd Sister and her Sister Aylett, recorded in new Kent county court. The deed expresses the Slaves were alloted to her, by her Brother W. Dandridge, as, and for a proportionable, or Childs part, of the value of the Slaves, of Colo. Dandridges estate. I shall be very much obliged to you, to inform me, whether the Slaves, said to be alloted, were ever delivered, to Mrs Washington: by whom the allotment was made, and whether, if it was not made by her Bror William, he ever assented to it.1
Betsy Joins me in love to your Lady self & Mr Custisand am Dr Sir Your most obedt Servt

P.S. direct to me at Colo. Bassetts. J.A.2
