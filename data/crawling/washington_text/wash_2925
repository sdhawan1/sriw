Buckner was here last Tuesday and promisd to do the needfull if possible, left the Town on Wednesday and I am this Evening informd by Mr Whiting that he would not return, and as I heard a Gentleman this day say he was to receive Three hundred pounds from Buckner I conclude you will get no Money, have therefore agreed for your Bills to Mr Charlton at the Currt Exchg. wch is not setled as the drawers expect 30 Ct & the buyers offer 25 Ct am now going to get the 300 to send you to the care of your Brother Charles as wrote you by Mr Henderson have paid all demands agst you and have recd & paid as  Margin, Mr Mongomery will not pay the Balle of Whitings Bond Colo. Banister says he will pay before he leaves Town Warner Lewis have not seen shall go that way John Fry not in Town, Armistead not in Town, Trustees of Bernard More will pay as soon as possible but no money at this time, in short disappointments so general that I never before have seen so little business done nor one Tenth so many disappointmts.1 I was fearfull from the beginning that Buckner would disappoint as I know Gloster County to be the worst in Virginia to have any Money matters to collect from, I wish You a good Journey, as you pass Prince Town call and see my Sons who will I am sure have great pleasure in seeing You2 I am Dr Sir Yr most Affectionate Hume Servt
