Sir
Camp at CambridgeAugust 30th 1775.



Your Favour of the 21st Instt is duly received, inclosing Mr Carters Information of the Capture of the Charming Sally: which from the circumstances attending it, was undoubtedly collusive. I have received Advice that another Vessel belonging to one White at Marblehead, whose ostensible Voyage was to Casco Bay was carried in soon after. Such Instances of Avarice, at such a Time, & in such a cause, call for a severe Scrutiny, & exemplary Punishment.1
Mr Livingston & some other Gentlemen from your City brought us the acceptable News of the safe Arrival of a large Quantity of Powder, & 500 Stand of Arms.2 Our Situation is such as requires your immediate Assistance & Supply, in that Article. We have lately taken Possession of a Hill considerably advanced towards the Enemy, but our Poverty prevents our

availing ourselves of any Advantage of Situation.3 I must therefore most earnestly intreat that Measures may be taken to forward to this Camp in the most safe and Expeditious Manner whatever Ammunition can be spared from the immediate & necessary defence of the province. The value of whatever may be sent in Consequence of this Request, will be paid by Order from hence when deliveredor negociated with the Honbl. Continental Congress at Philada as may be agreed with the Proprietors: I only request that no Time may be lost thro. any such Difficulties as our Situation is so critical & the Exigence so great. The Mode of Conveyance I must leave with the Provincial Congress, or the Committee of the City: I doubt not they will take every Precaution to make it safe & expeditious.4 I have the Honour to be Sir Your most Obedt & very Hbble Servt

Go: Washington
