Dear Sir.
Cameron April 26. 1769.



Inclosed you have your Papers which I borrowed.1
In Answer to the Sale of the LandI will take Two Pistoles pr Acre for it, which I Think a reasonable Price; Or I will give that Sum per acre for Poseys, if sold, or more.2
If you incline to purchase, I shall not call on you for the Money very soon, Six Months at least you may have, perhaps a Year or Two; for as I told you, The Money arising from the Sale of this Land I purpose to lay out in other Lands; And have no particular purchase in view at present. I wish you a pleasant Journey, & safe return home.3 I am Dear Sir, your most Obedt Hble Servt

John West junr
