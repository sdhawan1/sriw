The Council then resolved, that the Brigadier Generals of The Army, do call together the Field Officers in each Brigade now appointed to serve under The New Establishment, and they to Select out of those Captains, & Subalterns, who have returnd, their Names willing to continue in Service; so many as can be well recommended, the others to be rejected. attention to be paid to Those who are absent upon Furlough, or Command, the First of Those, to undergo the same Scrutiny, as those who give in their Names. if there are any Officers that have not returnd their Names, but are now willing to serve, & can be well recommended, their Names to be returnd, also the best Sergeants. A Return of all The Officers, the Regiments to which they belong, and their former Rank, to be made to The Commander in Chief, that they may be Formed into Regiments.
It appearing from information, that Several of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston, are desirous of leaving that place, & had obtained passes for that purpose, arising perhaps from a proclamation of General Howes, which seems to have a Tendency to Compel the Towns people to take up Arms, to aid the Ministerial Troops in subverting the Rights, & Liberties of America;24 & it also appearing from information, that the Small Pox is, at this Time in many parts of The Town of Boston, His Excellency desired to know whether, under these circumstances, it is prudent to suffer Any of the Inhabitants of the said Town, to be Transported to Chelsea, by the Way of Winnissimit Ferry?
As the Situation of American Affairs with respect to Great Britain, may such, as to render it indispensably necessary, to attempt to Destroy the Ministerial Troops in the Town of Boston, before they can be reinforced in the Spring; even if it should be by Bombarding, & Firing the Town, is it advisable to Erect any kind of Works upon Dorchester point, before Frost setts in; & what kind?

What proportion of pay are persons of Nonage & Apprentices to draw?
In our present Scarcity of powder, had not our morning Gun better be discontinued?
What is to be done with Mrs Inman if she comes out, see her Letter.25
