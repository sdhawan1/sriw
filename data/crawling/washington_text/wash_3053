Mr Wilper,
Novr 30th 1773.



Before your Letter of the 1st Instt came to my hands I had been to, & returnd from Williamsburg;1 Whilst I was there, I applied generally, in behalf of all the Officers who had been in the Virginia Service (claiming under His Majestys Proclamation of 1763) and obtaind the Inclosd order of Council. two days after which, & after I had left Town, it was determined in Council, that the Right, or Rights of deceased Officers or Soldiers cannot survive to their heir, or other representative; but that it was absolutely necessary that every person, as well officer, as Soldier, should Make personal application for their Land; and I have since discoverd that, the Governor will not grant his Warrant of Survey (agreeable to the Inclosd order of Council) to any that does not personally apply, even after such person has obtaind a Certificate of his Right; it not being sufficient, it seems, in his eye, to send such Certificate by a friend.2 Why this extreame caution I cannot tell, as it will serve to run the Officers to much greater expence in attending at Williamsburg, & will, I should think, defeat the claims of the common Soldiery altogether, as I am sure it is not worth their while to go two or three hundred Miles for a Warrt to Survey 50 Acres of LandAll Warrants are now to go to the County Surveyors of either Augusta Bottetourt, or Fincastle. Bullett is recalled, and his proceedings, I doubt, of no effect; as it is declard by the Govr that he had no authority from him to make any Surveys; however it would be worth your while to write to the Govr, shewing the hardship you will be put to, if you have the whole to go through again; & beg of him to grant you a Patent upon that Survey made in your own Rightas to the other, which you speak of, I know nothing of the Circumstances attending it, nor do I believe the Govr will grant a Patent for it (under the Resolution he seems here to have come to) till something further is done in it. Bullett I do suppose, upon your representing the mistake you complain of, would rectifie it; & I should think that his Lordship would in that case grant his Patent to you.3
All the Surveys under the Proclamation of 1754 are now made, & ordered to be Patented; & you have 600 acres allowed in a Tract of 21,941 acres upon a Creek called Pokatallico4 which
[392]
runs into the Great Kanahawa about 25 or 30 Miles from the Mouth of the Kanhawa. You are joind in this Survey with the Representative of Colo. Fry, Colo. Stephen, Colo. Andrw Lewis, Captn Hog, Lieutt Savage, Mr Bullett, & the Representative of Mr Wm Wrightthe reason of this strange conduct of jumbling so many names into the same Patent I have already informed you of; as also that, every Person under Govr Dinwiddies Proclamation was to share by the Rank they began the Campaign of 1754 InYou now must agree upon some time, & method with the above Persons to make a division of the above Tract; in order that you may be ascertaind of your particular property therein for till this happens you will not know how to cultivate & Improve it so as to save the Land agreeable to the Laws of this Country.5
I now take the liberty of Inclosing you a Copy of one of my printed Advertisements, with such further explanation of the Terms on which I propose to grant my Lands as I should think could not be unacceptable to those, who had a mind to possess themselves of some of the most valuable Land in that Country.6 if you can be of any Service to me in this Plan I shall acknowledge myself obliged to you, and at any rate should be glad to hear what your Country men think of the Terms I have now proposed. In the Spring I propose to send an Man out to be upon the spot. I think to send workmen also to build comfortable Houses, as I shall thereby answer the purposes of illegible. for the future & provide comfortable Lodgings for my tenants who must not in that case expect to be exempt from payment of Rent in the same manner as those who are to do all these things themselves. I am with esteem Yr friend & very Hble Servt

Go: Washington
