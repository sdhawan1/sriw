To Charles Lewis Esqr.\Caroline Cty/ Dear Sir
[Mount Vernon, 14 August 1755]



I return most \you my/ unfeigned thanks for your hearty demonstrations \expressions/ of Friendship, in \&/ kind congratulations on my safe return, and I wish, \my/ dear Charles, it was more in my power \than it is/ to answer the favourable opinion my Friends have conceivd of my \military/ abilitys. Let them not be deceivd, I am unequal to the Task, and \do/ assure you \that/ it requires more experience than I am master of to conduct an affair of the importance that this is now arisen to.
If I do go \it is committed to me/, I shoud think myself happy in havg you of our party, if you have reconcild it perfectly to yourself and Family, otherwise I think you woud be blameable to involve them in so much uneasiness as your absence will necessaryly give;1 I have wrote fully to your Brothr W[arne]r to whom I must refer you for further particulars[.] I am Dr Charles Yr most Obt & most Affecte
