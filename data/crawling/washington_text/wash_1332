Sir,
Mount Vernon January 1758



I wrote to you on the 26th and 30th Ultimo and Addressd Copies since which I have receivd my Bills of Lading for 14 Hogheads Toboone of which is Inclosd1I have also receivd my Goods from the Recovery,2 and cant help again complaining of the little care taken in the purchase: Besides leaving out one half, and the most material half too! of the Articles I sent for, I find the Sein is without Leads, Corks and Ropes which renders it uselessthe Crate of Stoneware dont contain a third of the Pieces I am chargd with, and only two things brokeand every thing very high Chargd. It woud be in my power, coud I be upon any degree of certainty that my Tobo woud suit the Bristol Market, to Ship you a pretty large Quantity annually, but I apprehend the quality & Management will scarce meet an adequate pricewhat I have on board the Nugent is of this sort, and all of the present Years growth; the Sales of which will probably determine my future ShippgIf I can get any of my Tobo Rents in time enough for yr Ships I shall Recomd them to your Care also.3
In my last I desird two pair of Workd Ruffles at a guinea each
