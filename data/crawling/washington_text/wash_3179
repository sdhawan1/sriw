Dear Sir
Pittsburgh May 1st 1774



I just snatch this minute by Major McDonald to acqumutilated You, that we are all in infinite confusion at this place, owing to mutilatedtilities now actually begun, & subsisting between us, & the Indians: mutilated Amount of which I have in a brief manner mentioned to His Excemutilated Lord DunmoreI have this day sent Expresses into mutilated the different parts of the Country, to collect the Militia, & to impmutilated all Tools & instruments necessary towards making this place defemutilated against the Enemy; & at the same time have dispatched Messengmutilated down the River to order our People to desist from further hostmutilated with a View to bring about an amicable reconciliation; tho mutilated really am apprehensive, the attempt will be unsuccessfull.
I flatter myself upon this occasion notmutilateding our Government disputes, that we will be unanimous in oppomutilated Common Enemy: & therefore hope we will not stand in need of ymutilated Assistance below: at any rate, I expect we will be enabimutilated stand our ground, long enough, at least, to acquaint you with mutilated inabilities to resist alone, & to pray assistance from your Qumutilated.1
Excuse (Dr Sir) the inaccuracies of this Lemutilated the multiplicity of perplexing Circumstances, which now engages mutilated attention, flowing from the Source mentioned, prevent me from mutilated as copious, on the Subject as I could wish; & therefore pemutilated me to subscribe myself your Friend & Obedt Servt
