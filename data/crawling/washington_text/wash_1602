Camp at Fort Cumberland Augt 19th 1758



This afternoon the Party Commanded by Capt. McKinzie returnd without being able to discover anything of the Enemys motions, they waylaid the Road for several days near the great Crossings and intended to have advancd quite to that Post, had not their Provisions entirly spoild, notwithstanding every method and the utmost pains for its preservation was taken; some of their advancd Sentrys had nearly killd a small Party of 3 Cherrokee Indians, returning from Warthis small Party went from hence upwards of six weeks ago1 and this is the 4th Day since they left Fort DuQuesne, the Environs of which they long watchd, at length was obligd to cross the Ohio, where they killd two Squaws, whose Scalps they brought in here; they say there are a good many women & Children on that side the River, but very few men either French or Indians at the FortCapt. McKinzie says theres no signs of the Enemys having been lately on G. Braddocks Road so far as he proceed on it, Serjeant Scot and 4 private of his Party went on to Fort Du Quesne so soon as they return will transmit you any Intelligence they may procure.2
I should be extremely glad to receive some Bacon or Salt Provisions of some kind, without which it will be impossible for any Party I can send out to answer the proposd end.
The Convoy from Winchester was yesterday at the North River (five days March for them from hence) so that we cannot expect them in less than 5 or 6 days especially as they lost some horses.3 I am with Regard Dear Sir Your Most Obt Hume Servant
