I recd your Dispatches containing the disagreeable Accts of the Check we received before Fort du Quesne forwarded by Lieutt Smith from Fort Loudoun on 2d instant, and laid them
[64]
immediately before the House1 who are still debating, one Day resolving on one Scheme the next, on another in Relation to Military affairs [so] that nothing is yet determined upon.2
Our Loss is great if we consider the brave Officers & men who fell, but if we think only of numbers mutilated inconsiderable, and can be of no great Consequence for by the Behaviour of your Men they shew they are not to be soon daunted: They have acted in the Manner that was expected from them, and in wch I dont doubt they will continue to act, and so merit and meet the Applause of their Country.
I have orderd the Blankets up to Winchester to be deliverd as soon as possible that you may repay the General those he furnishd you with. And have sent up the blank Commissions you desired, and dont doubt but you will fill them up according to merit.
The same Messenger who brot yours brought also an acct of the blowing up a Magazine at Fort-Cumberland wch surely was owing to Neglect some where; for I should think it highly improper that every Officer should have free Admission into a Magazine, and suppose it is some particular Officers Duty, whether Store keeper or otherwise to go in; and fetch what is wanted from Magazines. Mutilated this is the Case at present I think Inquiry ought to be made where the Neglect lay, if it is not a Rule, I think it ought to be made one.3
I am sorry to give you any additional Trouble, but must mutilated you will give orders, that whoever is sent down to mutilated wth Expresses may be furnishd with Money in advance to proceed on his Journey, for want of which Davis a Soldier in your Regiment (I think) who brought the Dispatch to me, came almost dead having lain three nights in the Woods almost without Sustenance. He having no Money, no House would receive him, or supply him wth common necessaries of Life. This can mutilated no hardship on any Body as they are sure to have it allowed and repaid. I most sincerely wish you better and speedy Success, being wth great Esteem Yr very Hum. Servt
