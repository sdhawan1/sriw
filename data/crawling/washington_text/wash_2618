Sir
Sniggers1 Sepr 23rd 1770.



I have met here to day, & so have your Evidences, agreable to appointment, but only two Commissioners have appeard which is not sufficient; Mr Scott2 is sent for, and on his arrival we shall proceed to business; when you may depend I shall do every thing necessary, on your behalf.

Mr Thomas Hite has this day acknowledgd, he has Thomass bond for the money the land was sold for, and offered to relinquish his claim to the land provided I would undertake to pay the amount of the bond, which is abt 12 & Interest; this I did not incline to do, as I had no instructions from you relative to such a proposal; and my own opinion was agt it, as I concievd Thomas & his heirs were liable for it, & that the land was not subject to it in the hands of an assignee.3 I am Sir Yr Mo: Obedt servt

Willm Grayson


N.B. They have surveyd the land, but as Marshall4 is not here I have not seen the survey. W. G.
