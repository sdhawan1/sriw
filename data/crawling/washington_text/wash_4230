Dear Sir
Cambridge 28[-30]th Novem: 1775



You may easily conceive that I had great pleasure in perusing your Letter of the 18th Instant which with the Inclosures I received
[452]
last EveningIt was much damped by my finding that General Montgomery had the same Difficulties to encounter with the Troops under your Command that I have with these hereNo Troops were ever better provided or higher paid, yet their Backwardness to inlist for another Year is amazing: It grieves me to see so little of that patriotick Spirit, which I was taught to believe was Characteristick of this peopleColonel Enos who had the Command of Arnolds Rear Division is returned with the greater part of his Men, which must weaken him so much as to render him incapable of making a successful attack on Quebec without assistance from General Montgomery: I hope he will be able to give it to him, and by taking that City finish his glorious Campaign.
I have Nothing material to communicate to you from hence, I am making every Disposition for Defence by throwing up RedoubtsHalf Moons &c. along the Bay, some of which have been constructed under the Enemys Guns,1 but they have not given us the least Disturbance, I suppose Mr Howe waits the arrival of his Reinforcement, when probably he will attempt SomethingHe has sent out about 300 Men Women and Children last Week, they give shocking accounts of the Want of Fuel & fresh provisionsGeneral Burgoyne is gone or going Home.2 I am Dear Sir with great Regard Your most obedt h: Servt

Go. Washington
