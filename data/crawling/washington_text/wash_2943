Sir
Philada 22d June 1773



I have perused the Letter you favord Mr Meredith with of the 17th and am obliged by your inclination to correspond with my partners at Madeira1Altho its not usual to ship fine wine but for bills of Excha. I have inclosed a letter to the house requesting they woud comply with your orders for a few pipes of that quality for your own use & take the payment in flour as you propose2Its an article likely to answer your purpose as well as I can judgeI think if the quality is very good it will not clear less than 15  Ct or more& Corn as muchfor the proceeds of the last your returns may be orderd in wines most salable with you of any denomination except particular.
[245]
In every part of the transaction at Madeira I have so much reliance on my partners skill & integrity that you may freely consider me as accountable to you for whatever ought to be expected from good factors.
You will please to insert in the Bill of Loading frt payable in wine of any kind except particular or Bill wine: and shoud the owners be disengagd to any house there I shall thankfully acknowlege your interposition to get the vessel & remainder of the Cargo consignd to your frds which as a considerable shiper only youll have some right to apply for.3
