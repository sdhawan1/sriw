To Colon. Henry Peyton, of the Prince-William Militia. Sir,
[Winchester, 4 June 1756]



I was pleased to hear of your alertness in marching to Pattersons Creek upon the last alarm; and doubt not but you will continue to be vigilant and active in the service of your Country; as that is the most certain road to merit applause.1 I am informed that Mr Parker continues on his place, and has a quantity of Grain:2 If this be true, I would advise that a party of about twenty or twenty-five men and an officer, be sent to his assistanceand that you would upon all alarms, endeavour to collect yourselves into such formidable Bodies as can not be hurtand rather waylay and act by stratagem, that attempt to pursueand find if possible their Sleeping places, and surprize them at night.
The enclosed3 I must desire you to forwardas well as all expresses that are sent to me, with the greatest expedition. I am &c.

G:W.
Winchester, June 4th 1756.
