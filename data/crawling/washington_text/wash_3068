Dear Sir
Gunston-Hall Decemr 21st 1773



The embarrassd Situation of my Friend Mr Jas Mercers Affairs gives Me much more Concern than Surprize. I always feared that his Aversion to selling the Lands & Slaves, in Expectation of paying the Debts with the Crops & Profits of the Estate, whilst a heavy Interest was still accumulating, woud be attended with bad Consequences, independant of his Brothers Difficultys in England; having never, in a Single Instance, seen these sort of Delays answer the Hopes of the Debtor.1 When Colo. Mercer was first married, & thought in affluent Circumstances by his Friends here, considerable Purchases of Slaves were made for Him, at high prices (& I believe mostly upon Credit) which must now be sold at much less than they cost: He was originally burthened wth a proportionable Part of his Fathers Debts; most of which, as well as the old Gentlemans other Debts, are not only still unpaid, but must be greatly increased by Interest; so that even if Colo. Mercer had not incurrd a large Debt in England, He woud have found his Affairs here in a disagreeable Situation.2 I have bye Me Mr Mercers Title-Papers for his Lands on Pohick run, & on Four-Mile run, in this County; which I have hitherto endeavourd to sell for Him in Vain; for as He left the price entirely to Me, I coud not take less for them than if they had been my own; this Difficulty will not be lessened, but the Contrary, by your becomeing the Purchaser. Had I sold them to an indifferent Purchaser, I shoud, in the common way of Business, have stretchd my Demand as far as it woud bear, but between You & Mr Mercer I woud fain consider myself as a mutual Friend, & Arbiter; & from my Connections with Him, I know He woud wish Me to act in that Manner; which renders it
[410]
   an Affair of some Delicacy, & takes it out of the common Mode of Business3I have had some applications from Maryland, to only one of which I paid much Regard; this was from a Gentleman whose Circumstances I was well acquainted with, & knew his payments coud be relyed on; I expected, in answer to what I said to Him, that He woud have appointed a Day to meet Me on the Lands & examine them; but have heard nothing from Him lately; which I ascribe merely to an Indolence of Temper, for which He is pretty remarkable4The Tract upon four Mile run is containd in two Patents, one granted to Stephen Grey for 378 Acres, the other to Gabriel Adams for 790 Acres, they appear by the platt to overmeasure considerably, & contain, clear of Strutfields elder Patent, (with which they interfere) 1225 Acres. I have formerly been upon this Land; but its so many Years ago, that I now know very little of it, from my own Knowledge; but from the best Information I have had, that part of it upon Four-Mile Run (in Stephen Greys Patent) is tollerable good, & the other mean; but from its Vicinity to Alexandria; which now bids fair to be a very5 considerable Town, I think it must be worth 1000CurryColo. Carlyle (whose Lands adjoin) told Mr Mercer that it was worth 20/ an Acre, & that if He had the Money, He woud give that Price for it; perhaps this might be only one of the Colonels; Yet it has raised Mr Mercers Expectations. Upon the Whole Sir, if You will appoint any Day after Christmass, I will wait on You, & we will ride over the Land together; when we shall both be better able to judge of its Value. There was some little Difficulty in the Title from Stephen Grey; which Mr Mercer has been very candid in laying open to Me, & which Mr Pendleton (whose Opinion I have) has I think cleard up in a very satisfactory Manner.6
I am much obliged to You for yr Information concerning the Lands upon the Western Waters. I long to have a little Chat with You upon the Subject; & if Doctr Connelly, who has promised to spend a Day or two with Me as He returns from Wmsburg, is as good as his word, I will do myself the Pleasure of taking a Ride with Him to Mount Vernon.7
I heartily wish Mrs Washington & You a merry Christmass, & many, very many, happy New-Years; and am, very sincerely, Dr Sir Yr affecte & obedt Sert

P.S. Mr Lund Washington was so kind to promise my Son, He woud have some Corn I bought of yr overseer Cleveland, waggoned to my Quarter on little Hunting-Creek; I beg the Favour of You to remind Him of it.8
