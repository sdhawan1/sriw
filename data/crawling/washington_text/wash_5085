Varnum which I beg you will attend to, if the facts are as Set forth therein he must be redressd for if Such practices as he complains of are given the Least Countenance toit will have the worst of Consequences by encouraging Soldiers to shift from one Regt to another & throw the whole army into Confusion1I have had no advice from Congress relative to your resignation, I shall write them this day to know whom they may think proper to apoint to the
