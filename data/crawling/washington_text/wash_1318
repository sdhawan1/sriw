Dear Sir
Dogues Neck 4th Jany 1758



The Bearer (my Cousin French Mason) waits on You with an Acct I recd from Capt. Trent, amounting to 165.12.2 as I have an imediate Call for a pretty large Sum, you will particularly oblige Me in sending the Cash  this Bearer; who will give a Rect for what he receivesif you happen not to have the Cash at Home, I must beg the favour of You to order it for Me by the first safe Hand from Winchester.1 I intended to have waited on You myself this Day, or To-morrow, with this Acct but am prevented by an Express this Morning from Chappawamsic, to acquaint Me that my Sister Selden (who has been ill along time) is
[77]
now given over by her physician, & not expected to live many Hours, & I am just setting off upon the melancholly Errand of taking my last Leave of her!2
I hope You will comply with the Opinion & Advice of all Your Friends, & not risque a Journey to Winchester till a more favourable Season of the Year, or a better State of Health, will permit You to do it with Safety; & give Me Leave Sir to mention another Consideration, which I am sure will have Weight with Youin attempting to attend the Dutys of Your Post at a Season of the Year when there is no Room to expect an Alarm; or any thing extraordinary to require Your presence, You will, in all probability, bring on a Relapse, & render Yourself incapable of serving the public at a time when there may be the utmost Occasion; & there is nothing more certain than that a Gentleman in Your Station owes the Care of his Health & Life not only to himself & his Friends, but to his CountryIf You continuee any time at Mount Vernon, I will do myself the pleasure of spending a Day or two with You very soon.
I am with Mrs Masons3 Compts & my own to yr Brother, his Lady, & Yrself Dr Sir Yr affecte humble Sevt

G. Mason


P.S. You will be pleased to return the Acctg  the Bearer; for I have not any Copy of it; & if its necessary for you take it in, I will enter it in our Books, & send it you again.
