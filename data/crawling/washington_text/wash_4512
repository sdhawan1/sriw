Cambridge 19th January 1776



The Inclosures herewith sent, convey such full accounts of the sad reverse of our affairs in Canada, as to render It unnecessary for me, in my present hurry, to add ought to the Tale.1
Your spirited Colony will, I have no doubt, be sufficiently Impressed with the expediency of a vigorous exertion to prevent the evils which otherwise2 must follow from the repulse of our TroopsIt does not admit of a doubt but that General Carlton will improve this advantage to the utmost; and if he should be able to give different Current of Sentiment3 to the Canadians and Indians than those they seemed Inclind to adopt, words are unnecessary to describe the melancoly effect that will4 Inevitably follow.
I am persuaded therefore, that you will exert yourselves to the utmost, to throw in the reinforcement (by the Rout mentiond in General Schuylers Letter)5 that is now requ[i]red of your Colony, as the doing of it expeditiously may prove a matter of the utmost importance.
You will perceive by the minutes of the Council of War Inclosd,6 that the Regiment asked of you for Canada is one of the numbr7 applied for in my Letter of the 16th Inst.8 and that the only difference with respect to the requisition, is the length of time, and place of service, as no good would result from sending Troops to Canada for a shorter period than the Continental Army is raisd forto wit, till the first of January 1777. I am Gentn with great respect your most Obt Humble Servant

Go: Washington
