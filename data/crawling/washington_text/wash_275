[8 October 1755]



From hence I continued my journey to Colonel Baylors,1
[83]
when I was overtaken by an Express sent from Colonel Stephen, informing, that a Body of Indians had fallen on the Inhabitants, killed many of them, destroyed and Burnt several of their Houses.
Thereupon wrote to the Governor, and returned immediately to Fredericksburgh; and wrote a second Letter to the Governour, one to the Speaker, &c.2
