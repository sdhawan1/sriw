[141]
Father Left this place for Virginia, who then told me the Boy should be under my Care till he himself or his friends sent for him; till which time it was my intention to Continue him on in Learning which he took fast, having a Good Master, But to my great surprize his Father was no sooner gone than an order was producd, By Mr Wm Miner from the Captain to take the Boy to his House, where he has been Ever since, in Character of Barr keeper, Hostler &c. Subject to Catch the Vices & manners of the Meaner sort of people, of which the House is often full, as I keep a Publick House, I could have had him myself in the same way, But seeing the Inocence of the Boy, I could not think of giving him a Tavern Education, he Cost me while at School 10 in Board & other things, & for his Age when he went to Mr Miner there was not his match for Writing, any Merchant would gladly have such an Assistant, I would not trouble you with this Information But from hearing you are a Friend to the Boys familyand that Charity will Excite you to make known whoever is, acquainted with the matter, as his Continuance a Year Longer may be his total Ruin.1 I am Sir, Your Very Hble Sert
