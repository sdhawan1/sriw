There remains according to this a vacancy for an Ensign, to which I woud humbly recommend Mr Kirkpatrickwith the Office of Commissary of Musters.2 If Captn McNeil should be promoted Capt. Gist will be Captn Lt in his room; and another Ensign will be wanted: In that case the oldest Ensign will be made Ltand I would beg leave to speak in behalf of Mr

Thomas Rutherford for the vacancy of Ensign.3 He is a young man who, for his modesty and good behaviour gained a very good reputation as Lieutenant of one of the Ranging Companies on this quarter. I am Yrs
