[c.1759]



There are two undated lists of books in the Custis Papers (ViHi) in GWs hand. GW made the first list before 1761 and the second not until 1763 or 1764. The first of these, hereafter referred to as list 1, is printed here; the second, List 2, will be dealt with in volume 7 of this series of the Papers. In both lists, GW gives an abbreviated title of each publication and, occasionally, the last name of its author. He made List 1 at some time not long after his marriage to Martha Custis in January 1759. It is GWs listing of the books belonging to the deceased Daniel Parke Custis, nearly all of them inherited from his father John Custis. Most of the Custis books were at the house where old John Custis lived in Williamsburg, and GW probably made his list there. The appraisers valued the books at the White House in New Kent County at 4 and those at Williamsburg at 25 (doc. III-A1, entries 41 and 177).
In 1782, shortly after John Parke Custiss death, Bartholomew Dandridge, the executor of young Custiss estate, wrote to GW in New York: I observe you kept Col. [Daniel Parke] Custiss Books for his Son [John Parke Custis] and should be glad to know whether you or my Sister [Martha Custis Washington] chuse that Mr [John Parke] Custiss Books should be kept (20 Mar. 1782, DLC:GW). GW replied on 20 April: I had no particular reason for keeping & handing down to his Son the Books of the late Colo. [Daniel Parke] Custis, saving that I thought it would be taking the advantage of a low appraisement to make them my own property at it; and that to sell them was not an object, as they might be useful to him [young Custis] (ibid.). No other appraisal of Daniel Parke Custiss books has been found except the one in the combined county inventory (doc. III-A1).
The second list, List 2, is a list of the books at Mount Vernon, both those owned by GW and those inherited by young John Parke Custis from his father. GW made this list after receiving from England in the summer of 1763 Tobias Smolletts History of England in eleven volumes and four volumes of Dodsleys Annual Register and before receiving in 1765 twelve numbers of the Country Magazine and several other books the next year. In the first list he groups book titles under the headings Folio, Quarto, large Octavo, and Broken Setts; he lists the books in List 2 in more or less the same order but without the headings. For the first three pages of List 2, he also inserts after each title the initials JC or GW to indicate whether it was owned by John Parke Custis or himself.
[284]
The different book titles in List 1 number more than two hundred and fifty, and GW notes that there was a total of eighty unnamed Latin Books besides. All but about twenty of the abbreviated titles in List 1 also appear in List 2, often in slightly altered form. In addition, GW has in List 2 about ninety additional titles of works, at least two-thirds of which belonged to himself. None of these appear in List 1. See note 59, below.
In printing List 1, we have added in brackets after most of GWs entries an expanded but usually still shortened title of a pre1755 edition (chosen usually from the British Museum catalogue) of the specific work to which GWs short title may refer. In several instances, the identifying of a publication from the short title was made easier by an entry in still another list of the Custis books (List 3), one made for the inventory of John Parke Custiss estate in 1782 and including most of the titles in List 1 as well as additional ones (Fairfax County [Va.] Will Book D1, pp. 27885). In all, the Custis library probably included at Daniel Parke Custiss death in 1757 nearly three hundred titles in upwards of five hundred volumes.
In the notes, List 1 refers to the one GW made in 175961, List 2 to the one he made probably in 1764, and List 3 to the one Lund Washington made for the inventory of John Parke Custiss estate in 1782. Most of the titles have been supplied in brackets with assurance, but a few are only guesses. Some of the titles that have not been identified, and perhaps one or two that have, are undoubtedly binders titles.
