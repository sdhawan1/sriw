I think it will be more regular, that the accounts above mentioned should be settled by agents that will doubtless be appointed by the Congress to settle the accounts that are or may be depending with the different Provinces: This is the reason that I do not at present enter upon an examination of these accounts. I am,

Sir, your most Hb servt,
Go. Washington.
