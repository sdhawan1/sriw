The york Bill you Inclosed will over pay the postage of your Letter there being no Charge paid on Letters sent from this by the Packets to England, so that all the Expence Attending your Letter is the postage from Fort Loudoun here. Sr Charles Hardy is off Louisburgh with 8 or 9 Sail of the Line, & hope he will be able to prevent any Succors geting into that place.2
Mrs Robinson & family are very well & Desire their Compts to you as does Mr & Mrs Morris and your Most Obligd Humble Sert3
