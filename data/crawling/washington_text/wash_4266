Your Letter of the 8 Ultimo with a Postscript of the 14 from Point Levi, I have had the pleasure to receive1It is not in the power of any man to command success, but you have done moreyou have deserved it, & before this I hope, have met with the Laurels which are due to your Toils, in the possession of QuebecMy thanks are due, & sincerely offered to you, for your Enterprizing & persevering spiritTo your brave followers I likewise present them.

I was not unmindful of you or them in the Establishment of a new armyOne out of 26 Regiments, (likely Genl Putnams) you are appointed to the Command of, and I have Ordered all the Officers with you, to the one or the other of these Regiments, in the Rank they now bear, that in case they chuse to continue in service, & no appointment take place, where they now are, no disappointment may follow2Nothing very material has happened in this Camp since you left itFinding we were not likely to do much in the Land way, I fitted out several Privateers [or] rather Armed Vessells in behalf of the Continent, with which3 we have taken several prizes, to the amount it is supposed of 15,000 SterlingOne of them a valuable Store Ship (but no powder in it) containing a fine Brass mortar 13 Inch2000 Stand of ArmsShot &c. &c.4
I have no doubt but a juncture of your detachment with the Army under Genl Montgomerie, is effected before this: If so, you will put yourself under his Command and will I am persuaded give him all the Assistance in your power, to finish the Glorious work you begunThat the Almighty may preserve & prosper you in it, is the sincere & fervent prayer of Dr Sir &c.
