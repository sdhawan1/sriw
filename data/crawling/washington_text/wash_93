Honble Sir
Alexandria 20th of August 1754



Mr Peyrouney solliciting for leave to attend the Assembly,
[190]
hoping to have some allowance made for his loss of Cloaths &ca which he sustaind in common with us all, and being not thoroughly curd of his Wounds which has hitherto renderd him unfit for Duty I thought it proper to indulge him in his request, and he now comes for the purpose aforesaid1By him I again2 take the Liberty of recommending to your Honour the great necessity there is of a regulation in the Soldiers pay. and that a deduction be made for the Country to furnish them with cloaths; otherwise, they never will be fit for Service; they are now Naked and cant get credit even for a Hatt, and are teazing the Officers every Day to furnish them with these and other necessarysAnother thing which should be fixd indisputably, is the Law we are to be guided by; whethe[r] Martial, or Military if the former I must beg the favour of Your Honour to give me some written orders, & indemnification; otherwise I cannot give my assent (as I am liable for all the proceedings) to any judgement of the Martial Court that touches the Life of a Soldier; tho. at this time, there is absolute necessity for it, as the Soldiers are deserting constantly, and Yesterday while we were at Church 25 of them collected and were going of in Face of there Officers, but were stopd and Imprisond, before the Plot came to its full hight.3 Colo. Innis did not fill up any Commissions for the Virginia Regiment which has given those that were entitled to promotion some uneasiness;4 his reasons were, it woud be an unnecessary expence to the Country till there were orders to recruit, but this I think shoud not have been considerd while it is rememberd who5 small encouragement is shewn them upon every occasionanother motive which I believe served to prevent it, was, his dislike to the tenour of the Commissions, which favourd so much of the Militia: he told me he woud send down another for your Approbation, & Colo. Fairfax has also taken another both of which is greatly preferable to those by which we act. and here I must beg leave to acquaint your Honor that the one you sent me is not signedThe Officers are uneasy abt their Pay, and think it hard to be kept out of it so long; they hope your Honour will order, that the dates of their Commissions be from the vacancys that happend, of which I have enclosd a list for information hoping with them your Honour will be kind enough to fill them up yourself and send such Comn as were sent for Presedents.6
[191]
Mr West Lieutt of Vanbraams Company has resignd his commisn which I herewith sendI also inclose a List of Medecines which the Doctr desires may be procurd for the use of the Regiment;7 he sollicits much for a Mate & I believe it necessary as he often has more business than he can well manage, then were a large Detacht sent upon Duty it woud be imprudent to go witht a surgeon: If your Honour shoud think proper to promote Mr Peyrouney we shall be at a loss for a good Disciplinarian to do Adjutants Duty wch requires a perfect knowledge of all kinds of the Duty. I shoud therefore take it extreamely kind if you woud be pleasd to confer the Office upon Mr Frazier who I think I can fully answer for let his former conduct be what it will.8 We have Catchd two Deserters which I keep imprisond till I receive your Honours answer how far the Martial Law may be extended, and it is absolutely necessary that an Example be made of some for warning to others, for there is scarce a Night, or oppertunity but what some or other are deserting, and often two three or 4 at a time; we always advertize, & pursue them as quickly as possible, but seldom, to any purpose:9 the expences attending this will fall heavy upon the Country while this Spirit prevails. I am Your Honours Most Obt & most Hble Servt

Go: Washington


NB I shoud be extreamely pleasd if your Honour thought it advisable to send these Commissions by Majr Carlyle or the first Opperty.
