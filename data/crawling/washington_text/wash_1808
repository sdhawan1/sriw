Since my return1 I have been pretty much confind thro the
[194]
tenderness of my constitution and the inclement season of the year, which prevented me hitherto from enjoying that pleasure I promised myself amongst my friends and acquaintencesand cuts me short of that intelligence to be met with from Virginia and other places relative to publick affairshowever, we had a speedy and particular account of your success at Du Quesnewhich fell at length an easy preyafter the numberless risks your person happily escapedlet me give you joy on this occasionand welcome the wishfull prospects of peace that must undoubtedly result from this circumstance, to the poor and oppressd inhabitants of Virginiawhose calamities and sufferings deserve Royal sympathyhowever disregarded and misrepresented they have hitherto beenI have not learnd further particulars than the reduction of the placeand leaving Capt. Waggener in it with 300 Menwhat the remainder of the forces are employd inWhat your destiny and inclination leads you toor what are intended by the General this insuing summer I am quite unacquaintedAs to your own dispositions, whether you incline to mix again in military matters and share the honours & dangers of another Campaignor prefer the peacefull enjoyment of that happiness you have helped to restore, to a retired lifeYour are equally my concernand my best prayers are ever attending you.
The favour of your Letter with accounts of the roads and forces was vastly acceptable and entertaining to many2Coud you continue to oblidge me with a letter now and thenit woud be a great honourand if I coud contribute any thing towards your service while herenothing woud please more than to be employd.
