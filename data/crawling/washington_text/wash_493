To Ensign Mordecai Buckner, at Winchester.
[Alexandria, 14 January 1756]



As Colonel Washington is doubtful1 that some of the men, to whom you delivered Shoes, Stockings, Shirts, &c. here, have received them a second time at WinchesterDesires you will examine the Commissarys Book there; and if you find any such, give a list of them to the Pay-Master; in order that he may stop the value of them next pay-day. As soon as you receive this, you are to continue your march to Fort Cumberland with your Detachment, and all the men in Winchester; except those of the
[283]
Troop of Light Horse; and deliver the men to the Commanding Officers of the Companies they belong to. I am &c.

G:M. aid de camp.
Alexandria: January 14th 1756.
