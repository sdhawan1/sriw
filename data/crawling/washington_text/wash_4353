Dr Sir
Mount Vernon Decembr 17th 1775



Your Letter of 20th Novmbr I have recieved.1 I am uncertain whether the People got by Cleveland to Value his improvements made upon your Land, was appointed by the Court or not, but If I remember right they were swore by a single majestrate, he has a Certificate of the Valuation, (but whether an order of Court appointing them or not I forget) sworn to, I will enquire more particularly into it & If I find he has Errd send him to the C[oun]ty Courts where in the Land lays, & get his wo[r]ck Recordedhe told me he had followed your Instructions in every particular, & had attended to the Act of Assembly, a Copy of which you gave him2I fear he has done wrong, I was not particular enough in examineg his Papersbut told him if he had done in all things According to his Instructiontwas Well, take care of the Papers until your return, I have wrote to him to come down, that I may more particularly inquire into what he
[570]
has done& will hereafter Inform you. Mr Thos Lawson several times applyed to me for a Sum of money you promised to pay at Wmsburg by Colo. Lewis on Ac[coun]t of Mr Robt Lawson 24.16.7for Iron had in May 1774& wrote me that you had once or twice appologised by letter for the disappointg himI have paid him.3 I fear it will not be in my power to get any Money from Mr AdamI mentiond in my last that Jennifer Adam, had made Deeds for his Land to youI have not got his Negroe Fellow in Possession, the Fellow will not come to Virginia, What shall I do with him, had he not best be sold.4
Gilbert Simpson has never sent to me this FallI wrote to him that I intended he should recieve the money for the Servts & that I would send the Indentures by the first safe opportunityI expect to have an opportunity soon. Whether he has got the Mill to worck yet or not I cannot tell.5 Colo. Tayloe has not yet taken Colo. Mercers Bonds out of my handsa yo[u]ng man that Mr Lawson sent here the other Day Askd if I had got a Letter from Colo. Tayloe lately, that he had wrote me, I have never Recieved it, therefore cannot tell why he does not send for the BondsA Mr Coomes liveg in Maryland near Snowdons Worcks6 writes to me desireg to know Who is to make him Deeds for the Land he Bought, that being done, he is ready to pay the purchase MoneyI fear your absence will be an injury to Colo. Mercerfor it seems odd to me that, Colo. Tayloe does not take some steps to Collect the BondsColo. Fairfaxes affairs are much in the same wayI have wrote to Willis & Peyton several times about it but to no purpose, Willis says he has no Business with the Collection, Peyton has never answerd my Letters7Mr Bryan Fairfax is become a preacher he gave Publick Notice that on such a Day he shoud preach at his own House Accordingly on that Day, Many Asembled to hear him, but to their great Confusion & surprize he Advised them to return to the Boosom of that Church in which they had been brought up (The Church of England) for he had been at much panes in Examineg the Scriptures, & the different modes of Worshipg the Supreme being, which was now adopted by many, to the disgrace of Christianity, & that he found none so pure & undefiled as that prescribed by the Canons of the Church of England8you no doubt get the Virginia Papers in the Camp,
[571]
by them you will learn how our Army here come on in the Fightg way, beside the Ac[coun]ts containd in them, we have one jest come to hand, of a Party of Lord Dunmores men Attackg one hundred of our men that were intrenchd on this Side the Great Bridge, Dunmores Party were repulsd with the loss of 50 men killd & taken.9 It is said our Convention are to raise 4000 men, I suppose they will be raised out of the Minute Batalions, the Minute Men of this District are orderd to Wmsburg & I believe have Marchd, Lord Dunmores Negroe Soldiers are, it is said, commanded by Scotchmenproper Officers for Slaves, for they themselves Possess Slavish PrincipalsI think it woud be a good thing if several of the Privateers which we read of towards the Northward, were to come here, and take Lord Dunmore & his Squadronor if the Congress were to send the Vessles now fitg out at Philadelphia.
Three or four of our Negroes are sick tho not dangerous, unless Silvia at the Mill is, the Dr seems to apprehend her Lungs is affected. Colo. Mason is getg Well & Intends to Wmsburg immediately after Christmasnothing yet done towards a Battery upon Potowmackit is to be hoped the great encouragement offerd by our Convention for gund Powder (6/ pr lb. for all brought here for Six months) will shortly bring enough of that now so necessary article in to this collony.10 I hope by this time Mrs Washington is with youmy Best Respects to herCustis & Lady and am Dr Sir your very Affectionate & Humble Servt
