Sir,
Roxbury Decr 8. 1775



Capt. Chapin is one that was Arrangd as a Captain in Colo. Wards Regt But does not find himself Successful in Recruiting, & for Some other Reason brought me his Resignation, which I herewith inclose, Capt. Hazleton who Served as a Capt. in the Same Regt with Said Chapin the Last Summer Returnd to Stay & was Arrangd with Colo. Jonathan Brewer, But by Some Means after the Arrangment was Setled he was Disappointed as I am Told, By Colo. Brewers appointing another in the Place that was Assignd himCapt. Hazelton is well recommended by Colo. Fellows & others, whom he has Servd with, & would be Glad of your Excellencys approbation for Taking Chapins Place.1
