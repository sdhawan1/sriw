Mount Vernon 4th Septr 1766.



Your favour of the 25th of March came safe to my hands, but not till lately.1
My Tobacco Consignments to London, has been confind in a great measure to one House, and where there is no essential causes of complaint I have generally held it inconsistent with
[462]
the rules of good policy & common justice to be always changing. True it is, my Tobacco has fetchd less than I think it ought to have done for sometime past; but this, as it might have been owing to my prejudice & partiality, rather than remissness in the Sellar I have hitherto submitted to itHowever, as Interest in most cases is, and in this particular one ought to be, consulted, I have no scruples in confessing, that I shoud feel the warmest Inclinations to those whose care and assiduity woud render me the most pleasing and beneficial Sales, if I could find them out, and was still to pursue the business of Tobacco making; but this I have left off in a great measure, & believe I shall discontinue it totally on this River (Potomack).2
Your Agent has committed some mistake in advising you that I owe for a Servant since the year 1759The firstindeed the onlyServant I ever bought from any of your ships till this spring, was in the year 1763 & for this I paid Doctr Ross (of whom I purchased him) according to agreement.3 There are many persons in this Country of my name (th I know of none bearing the same Christian name) if the mistake therefore has not arisen from this, I do not know how to account for it.
