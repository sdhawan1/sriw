Sir,
Philada 18th Augst 1772



Your Favour of 14th Currt has enabled me to compleat your Insurance  the Fairfax as  above acct (say annexed acct,) so far as the Nature of your Adventure will admit without running you to an extra. advance of prmo subject to conditional Returns afterwards, which on several accts might prove disadvantageous to you, altho is often done on risques not commencing in our own Port.1
I presume Coll Lewis may not be returnd Home from the warm springs, & defer writing to him until next Post. I am very Respectfully, Sir, Yr assd frd & servt

Amos Strettell
