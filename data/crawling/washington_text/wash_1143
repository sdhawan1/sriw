Copies of Letters to the County Lieutenants of Prince-William and Culpeper.Gentlemen,
[Fort Loudoun, 25 June 1757]



This will serve to acquaint you, that I have received subsequent intelligence to that transmitted to you;1 which contradicts the report of the enemys having carried down a train of artillery, and that they have taken Rays-town-road; by which it is imagined their intention is more probably against Pennsylvania than this province. Therefore I hope that the Militia may not be immediately wantedHowever shall leave it to you to act as you shall think proper.
As I am informed by the Governor that he has (in consequence of our first intelligence) ordered up a third of the Militia of several Countiesamong which yours are included2
[258]
And as I sent him an express immediately upon the receipt of this last account: And, altho it is beyond a doubt, that a considerable body of the enemy is coming down; yet I think by their rout, they will not send their principal force this way. I am &c.

G:W.
Fort Loudoun, June 25th 1757.
