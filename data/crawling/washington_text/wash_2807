Sir,
Mount Vernon July 20th 1772



If the price of Superfine Flour in Barbadoes is not under Twenty five Shillings prCt I would have mine sold there rather than hazard any other Market; but if it should be lower than this, I would in that case, take the chance of some of the other Islands (if you should call at them in your way to Jamaica) in any of which, if you can get such a price as to nett me two pence a pound Virga Curry by the Invoice exclusive, of Freight, Commissions, & every other Incident charge, I would take it; unless there should be a moral certainty of its selling higher in JamaicaIf all these chances fail, the Flour must then be sold in Jamaica for what it will fetch, unless it should be very low, & a prospect of rising; in which case I would have it left with Mr McMickan & Co. to sell, provided, (upon examination) it is found to be in a condition to keep. In the disposal of this Flour, I recommend its being lumpd of, rather than sold in small parcels for tryal, as it was ground out of indifferent Wheat, & will, I fear, look better to the eye, than it will proove agreeable to the taste, being a little Musty.1

The Money arising from the Sales I would have laid out in Negroes, if choice ones can be had under Forty pounds Sterl.; if not, then in Rum & Sugar from Barbadoes, or any of the Windward Islands; and Sugar & Molasses if the Flour shd be sold in Jama.
If the Returns are in Slaves let there be two thirds of them Males, the other third FemalesThe former not exceeding (at any rate) 20 yrs of agethe latter 16All of them to be strait Limbd, & in every respect strong & likely, with good Teeth & good Countenancesto be sufficiently provided with Cloaths.
