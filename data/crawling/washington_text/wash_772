Sir
Williamsburg June 18th 1756



I desire You to send me a List of the Volunteers You are to appoint to the Vacancies in Your Regiment& the Number of Draughts from the Militia, which I am sorry to think will be much fewer than I expected.1
As the Regimt will be pretty much divided in Forts &ca I thot it proper & necessary to appoint Mr Boyd the Pay-Mr, Muster Master,2 by which on paying the Men he will be able to make an exact return of each Company to You, & in course will be a Check to the Officers to keep their Companies as compleat as possible.
I wish You Health & Success in Your Operations & I am Sir Your most humble Servt

Robt Dinwiddie
