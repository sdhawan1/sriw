Sir
Mount Vernon March 30th 1767



I Have dilivered Mr Adam the Wheat all but about 40. Bushels which was at the Mill & that a Vessle was to have calld for last Satturday, but has not yet come down Clevelands Crop 1520.1
We began to Plow at Doeg Run last Wednesday with three plows and continued at it all the week tho. the ground was very wet. it began to rain here Satturday night & continued till last night so tha[t] I dont expect we shall be able to Plow there to day the people that are not plowing are employd in hoeing the green Sward spots about the field.
Muddy Hole, one plow has worckd ever since you left home
[494]
& the cart carrying out the Dung tho. not yet done the other people after cuting down the corn stocks raked the new ground made up the new Fence on the ferry Road & prepared the Flax ground, tho. not sewd owing to its being too wet, shoud sewd this day had no more rain falln.
At the Mill they have listed the Field they were about & begun the other Saturday Evening, they have carted most part of the Dung.
I got our Flax ground at home in order last week & began to sew Saturday after noon but was not able to get more than  part of it sewd & now it is as wet as ever & the same labour to do over again, however I wish Id sewd no part of it, for the rains falling immediately on it will bake the ground so hard that I suppose the Flax will come to nothing as Usualwe have been triming the hops & seting up new poles tho. not yet done.
In the Neck they have listed the two River Cuts & done some part of both the othersstopd up some gullys & hoed up some of the Tuff parts of the Field made up their Fence &c.
Sam has been seen since you left home by Bisup. & one John Moxly but neither had it in their power to catch him, you desired me to inqu[i]re if he had any particular mark. it seems he has a nick cut in the under part of one of his Ears & a mole or wart upon his uper lip about the bigness of a small pea, as to his size colour &c.you can describe yourself shoud you incline to advertise him.2
I was askd by a master of a Vessle since you left home if I woud take 12/6 for your corn I told him you had refused it several times he sd he thought you were to blame for he was very clear it woud be no higher, who he was I dont know, Cleveland told me the other day he was offerd 12/6 ready money for his but I dont know by who. shall inqu[i]re & indeavour to sell your corn.
The Family are all well. I am Dr Sir Your Very Humble Servt
