Sir,
[Mount Vernon] Novr 13th 1771.



Inclosed you will receive a Copy of the Act Impowering your Grandfather to sell certain Intaild LandsThere being no
[546]
printed copy of it, I was obliged to have recourse to the Inrolld Bills in the possession of the Clerk of the House of Burgesses, and consequently pay the Fee established by our Assembly (which is 15/) an expence I would have saved you, by copying it myself, if the private Acts of that date had been Printed; but it seems they are not.1 Colo. Carters Escheat of Hallowss Land is not among the records in the Secretarys Office, for this you will be obliged to apply to the Proprietors office;2 and Mr Everard, the principal clerk in the Secretarys, being constantly engaged with the Court business I could not get him to search for the Papers, and decree in favour of Hallows against Manleys heirI attempted it myself, but for want of knowledge in their Records, I could not trace the proceedings regularly on; though I found where the Suit was commenced in April 1720 by Hallows, against George Eskridge Guardian to your Father3I shall probably go to Williamsburg again in Feby as the Assembly, it is supposd, will then meet; and shall find the Clerks more at leizure to search for the Papers you want, or if this will be delaying the matter longer than you would choose, I could write to Mr Everard by the Post, who I dare say would send transcrips from the records of every thing necessary to illucidate the point you want to know.
Herewith you will receive the Notes &ca agreeable to your Memm and the Treasurers rect for the Sum you sent by me, but he would not receive the Acct as the 61 Hhds of relanded Tobo should mutilated be a credit to the Country mutilated was money actually received, or ought to have been so, mutilatedlaced to the Country credit as the Warehouses belongd to mutilatedI offerd to pay the difference, that is the 2.0.8, but he said this would answer no purpose, as the Acct must be fresh stated, at which time it would do equally well to receive the Ballance, and requested me to bring down the Acct with the alteration I have here mentioned, that he may enter a proper state of it in his Books. I am, Sir Yr Very Hble Servt

Go: Washington
