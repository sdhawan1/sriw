Sir.
Williamsburg June 12th 1756



I have read over Yr Memo.1 & observe thereon; I cannot advise how the Virga Regiment will be compleated if the Draughts from the Militia do not answer that End; but must here observe, if the Officers had performd their Engagements the Regiment woud have been in good Order, their Neglect & Breach of Promise is a great Loss to the Country.
[200]
The Scheme of forming the Regiment into two Battallions is very agreeable if compleated to a proper Number,2 but till I know the true Number of the Men, that must be for some time laid aside, at present the Officers are very near as great a Charge to the Country as the Men; when the Regiment is compleated to 1500 Men I do think the Scheme very proper, & when the Companies are compleated to 100 Men each, an addition of Field Officers & two Lieuts. I think will be very necessary. The building the Forts in proper Places must be left to You,3 as You know the Situation of the Country, so fix them in Places most convenient & necessary for our Protection; and the Form of the Forts must be agreeable to the Situation of the Ground, & the Distance from each must be from Yr own Judgement; I am of Opinion 100 Men shoud be appointed to each Fort, & a Detachmt of 50 or sixty from each to way-lay & watch the Enemys coming over the Mounts., at proper Places to attack them will answer better than hunting for them, as they are so well acquainted with the Woods they will always disappoint any such Attempts; whereas if they are surprizd in their March its probable it may be of more Service; in that Case the Detachmts from the Forts must be under strict Orders when to return, & if possible to have a proper Communication from one Fort to the OtherTools must be supplied if possible they can be purchased, the Sorts & Quantity You can best determine.
Till I have an effective return of each Company I cannot tell the Number, or the Deficiency of the Officers in compleating their Companies, which is Your Duty to annimadvert on.
As we must remain on the Defensive I think there is no occasion to compleat the Troop, but that they do Duty on Foot, unless You hereafter see an absolute Necessity for them, in that Case the Number to be as formerly. You must be a better Judge than I am who may be proper to act as Commissary if Mr Walker declines longer serving.
I shall be very glad if You can prevail on the Rangers to incorporate with Your Regiment, in that Case You know they will be included in the Number of 1500.4
Its comonly in the Kings Armies a contingent Charge on the Regiment for taking up Deserters & always with the Colonel to order therein.
[201]
It will be of much Service if You can enlist any of the Draughts & if they will voluntarily enter into the Service will help to compleat the Number proposd; I think they are not entitled to the two Pistoles unless they continue longer than December; You probably may prevail with them for a longer Time, enquire of the Speaker if he thinks they shoud have the two Pistoles for the Time limitted by the ActWhen You are in a Body the ordering them to the Allegany Mounts. as Kings Forces is proper & may be necessary on occasion as I conceive these Mounts. are in the Limits of the Government tho not setled. Fort Cumberland is a Kings Fort & built chiefly at the Charge of the Colony therefore properly under our direction till a Governor is appointed.5
Its absolutely necessary to detain a sufficient quantity of Stores now at Fort Cumberland which You may do by my Command & Orders.6
The Militia returnd to the different Counties shoud be draughted tho part of them are now out on Duty.7
These are my Thoughts on Your different Queries, but as it is impossible to be explicit on every Point, & as many Things may occur that cannot be directed, Your own Judgement must be Your Guide, as a great deal is left to Your own good Sense & Conduct.8 Pray God protect You and annimate You with Knowledge for his Service, & that of the Kings & the Country, is the sincere Desire of Sir Your most humble Servt

Robt Dinwiddie
