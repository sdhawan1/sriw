New York Febry the 5th[-6] 1776



I arrivd here yesterday but not without some difficultymy disorder encreasd rather than diminishd, so that I was under the necessity of being carried in a litter a considerable part of the way. I consider it as a piece of the greatest good Fortune that the Congress have detachd a Committee to this placeotherwise I shoud have made a most ridiculous figure, besides bringing upon myself the enmity of the whole Province1my hands were effectually tied up from taking any step necessary for the public service by the late resolve of the Congress putting every detachment of the Continental Forces under the Command of the Provincial Congress where such Detachment isI shoud apprise You that General Clinton arrivd almost at the same instant with myselfHe has brought no Troops with him and pledges his Honour that none are coming. He says it is merely a visit to his Friend Tryonif it is really so it is the most whimsical piece of civility I ever heard ofHe informs us that his intention is for N. Carolina where He expects five Regiments from England, that He only brought two companys of Light Infantry from Boston this is certainly a droll way of proceedingto communicate his full plan to the Enemy is too novel to be creditted2 The Congress Committee, a certain number of the Committee of Safety and Your humble Servt have had two co[n]ferencesthe result of these Conferences is such as will agreeably surprize Youit is in the first place agreed and justly that to fortify the Town against Shipping is impracticablebut We are to fortify lodgments in some commanding part of the City for two thoushand Men We are to erect inclosd Batteries on both sides the Water near Hell Gatewhich will answer the double purpose of securing the Town

against Piracies through the Soundand secure our communication with Long Islandnow become a more capital point than everas it is determined to form a strong fortifyd Camp of three thoushand Men in that Island immediately opposite to N. Yorkthe pass in the Highlands is to be made as respectable as possible and guarded by a Battalionin short I think the plan judicious and compleat3The two brass Pieces and other articles will be sent down as your require.4
You have heard of the fate of the Cannon near Kings Bridge5as I write with painYou will excuse my abrupt conclusionYours Dr General
