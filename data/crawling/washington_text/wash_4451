On this date Horatio Gates wrote to Ward: By His Excellencys Command, I am to acquaint you in Answer to your Letter of this morning, by The Orderly Adjutant: that he approves for the present of your sending the Remainder of Captain Bisels Company1 to Squantum but thinks hereafter a Good Militia Company had better be Stationd at that post, as the less the Establishd Corps are broke by Detachd Duties the Better. The General Thinks a Company a Sufficient Guard for the Stores, and Squantum.
