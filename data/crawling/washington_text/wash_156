To the Honble Willm Fairfax Esqr.\Belvoir/Honble Sir
[Fort Cumberland, Md., 7 June 1755]



I arrivd with my charge safe in Camp the 30th of last Month, after waiting a Day and piece in Winchester expecting the Cavalry to Escort me up; in which I was \being/ Disappointed, and \I was/ obligd to make use of a small Guard of the Militia of Frederick.1 \Cty./
The General, by frequent breaches of Contracts, has lost all degree of Patience; and for want of that consideration \temper/, & moderation which shoud be used by a Man of Sense upon these occasions, will, I fear, represent us home in a light we little deserve; for instead of blameing the Individuals as he ought, he
[299]
charges all his Disappointments to a publick Supineness; and looks upon the Country, I believe, as void of both Honour and Honesty;2 we have frequent disputes on this head, which are maintaind with warmth on both sides especially on his, who is incapable of Arguing witht; or giving up any point he asserts, let it be ever so incompatable with Reason \or commonsense/.3 There is a Line of Communication to be opend from Pensylvania to the French Fort \De Quisne/ Duquisne, along wch we are to receive, after a little time, all our Convoys of Provisions &ca;4 and to give all manner of encouragement to a People who ought rather to be chastisd for their insensibility of their own \to/ danger, and disobedience\regard/ of \their/ Sovereigns expectation. They \it seems/ are to be the Chosen \favored/ people, because they have furnishd what their absolute Interest alone indueced them to do, that is 150 Waggons, and an Equivalent number of horses.5
Majr Chapman with a Detachment of 500 Men & the Quarter Master General, Marchd two or three Days ago \before I arrived/ erasure here, to prepare \open/ the Roads and lay a deposit of Provisions in a small Fort which they are to Erect at the Little meadows.
To morrow Sir Peter Halkett with the first Brigade \is to/ begin their March; and on Monday the General with the 2d \will/ follows.6
Our Hospital is filld with the Sick, and the numbers increase daily, with the bloody Flux, which has not yet provd Mortal to many.7 General Innis has accepted of a Commission to be Governour of \Fort/ Cumberland Fort, where he is to reside, and will Shortly receive another to be hang man, or something of that kind \& for which he is equally qualified/.8 By a Letter \recd/ from Governor Morris \of Pennsylvania/ we have advice that a Party of three hundd Men passd Oswego on their way to
[300]
Fort Duquisne, and that another, and larger Detachment was expected to pass that place every moment. By the Publick accts from Pensylvania we are assurd that 900 Men has\ve/ certainly passd Oswego, to reinfor[c]e the French on Ohio, so that from \these/ erasure9 accts, we have reason to beleive \that/ we shall have more to do than go up the Hills to \and/ come down again.10
We are impatient to hear what the powers at home are doing; whether Peace or war is like to be the event \issue/ of all these Preparations. I am Honble Sir Yr most Obedt Servt

Go: Wn
