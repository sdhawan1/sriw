Lieut. Col. Abijah Brown tried at a late General Court martial, whereof Col. Hitchcock was presdtfor endeavouring to defraud the Continent, in mustering two Soldiers, whom he at the same time employed in working upon his farmThe Court having duly considered the evidence, are of opinion, that Lieut. Col. Brown is not guilty of any fraud, in endeavouring to have Harrington and Clarke musterd, in the manner he did: But the Court are of opinion, that Col. Brown is guilty of employing Harrington for fourteen days, and Clarke for eighteen days, out of Camp, upon his own business; yet are inclined to think it was done rather thro Ignorance, than a fraudulent intent, and therefore adjudge that he be find Four Pounds, lawful money, for the said offence.
The General orders Lt Col. Brown to be released, as soon as he has paid his fine to Dr Foster, Director of the hospital, who will apply it to the use of the sick, in the General hospital, under his careThe General hopes, the Stigma fixed on Lieut. Colonel Brown by the above sentence, will be a sufficient warning to all Officers, not to be guilty of the like offence, especially as the General is confident, no General Court martial will, for the future, admit a plea of Ignorance, in excuse of so atrocious a crime.1
