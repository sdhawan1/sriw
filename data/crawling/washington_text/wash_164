To Mr Jno. Auge Washington\Mount Vernon/Dear Jack \Brother/
[Martins Plantation, Md., 14 June 1755]



I receivd Yours of the 8th Instant from Fredericksburg,1 and am sorry to find that Allan is become importunate for a Debt of
[312]
so short standing; but it is the way of the World, \&/ therefore not to be wonderd at.2
I am pleasd to find \that/ you have a prospect of settling that\e/ affair with Patrick Kendrick, and shoud be very glad to hear you entertaind hopes of dis\re/covering my young Mare, as I had conceivd high expectations of her.3 My Negros Cloaths I hope you will take care to get in time, and employ Cleos leizure hours in makg them.4 I am exc\eeding/erasurely5 rejoycd that Tobo is likely to keep up its price, and doubt not but youll endeavour to make the most of mine, & of every thing else I have entrusted to your care, as you know \how necessary it is &/ what \entire/ erasure confidence I repose in your managemt.
I receivd a Letter Yesterday from my Brothr Saml who desires a division of our deep run tract \of Land/ this fall, which I6 am \will be/ very agreeable to \me/ and \I/ shall abide by any settlement you shall make on my behalf.7 \in this business./
As I have wrote to you twice since the first Inst.,8 I shall only add that the difficultys arising in our March from havg a number of Waggons, will, I fear, prove \an/ insurmountable \obstacle/ unless some scheme can be fallen upon to retrench the Waggons, & increase the back Loads \no. of Bat Horses/ which is what I recommended at first, & I believe is now found to be the most salutary means of transporting our Provisions & Stores to \the/ Ohio.9 I am Dr Jack yr &ca Camp at Georges Creek 14th June 1755
P:S: I have been able to procure Townshend Washington a Comn to be assistant Comy with pay at 5/: Sterg pr Day10 and Anthony Strother a pair of Colours in Colo. Dunbars Regiment.11
