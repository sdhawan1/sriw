To The Honble Robt Dinwiddie Esqr.\Williamsburgh/Honble Sir
[Fort Cumberland, Md., 18 July 1755]



As I am favourd with an oppertunity, I shoud think myself inexcusable, was I to omit givg you some acct of our late Engagemt with the French on the Monongahela the 9th Inst.
We continued our March from Fort Cumberland to Frazers (which is within 7 Miles of Duquisne) witht meetg with any extraordinary event, havg only a stragler or two picked Up by the French Indians.1 When we came to this place, we were attackd, (very unexpectedly I must own) by abt 300 French and Indns;2 Our numbers consisted of abt 1300 well armd Men, chiefly regulars, who were immediately struck with such a deadly \an inconceivable/ Panick, that nothing but confusion and disobedience of orders prevaild amongst them: The Officers in genl behavd with incomparable bravery, for which they greatly sufferd, there being near 60 killd and woundd A large Proportion out of the number we had!3 The Virginians \Companies/ behavd like Men, and died like Soldiers;4 for I believe out of 3 Companys that were there \on the ground/ that Day, scarce 30 were left alive: Captn Peyrouny and all his Officers down to a Corporal, were killd; Captn Polson shard almost as hard a Fate, for only one of his Escapd: In short the dastardly behaviour of the English Soldiers \Regular Troops/ exposd all those who were inclind to do their duty, to almost certain Death; and at length, in despight of every effort to the contrary, broke & run as Sheep before the Hounds, leavg the Artillery, Ammunition, Provision, and every individual \s Baggage & in short every/ thing we had with us a prey to the Enemy; and when we endeavourd to rally them in hopes of regaining our invaluable loss, \the ground and what we had left upon it/ it was with as much \little/ success as if we had attempted to have stopd the wild Bears of
[340]
the Mountains. \or rivulets with our feet, for they wd break by in spite of every effort that could be made to prevent it.5/
The Genl was wounded behind \in/ \/ the Shoulder, & into the Breast; of wch he died three days after; his two Aids de Camp were both wounded, but are in a fair way of Recovering; Colo. Burton and Sir Jno. St Clair are also wounded,6 and I hope will get over it; Sir Peter Halket, with many other brave Officers were killd in the Field: I luckily escapd witht a wound, tho I had four Bullets through my Coat and two Horses shot under me: It is supposed that we left \had/ 300 or more dead in the Field \killed/; abt that number we brought of\f/ wounded; and it is imagind \conjectured/ (I believe with great justice too \much truth/) that two thirds of both those numbers receivd their shott from our own cowardly dogs of Soldiers \Regulars/, who gatherd themselves into a body contrary to orders 10 or 12 deep, woud then level, Fire, & shoot down the Men before them.7
I Tremble at the consequences that this defeat may have upon our back setlers, who I suppose will all leave their habitations unless their are proper measures taken for their security.
Colo. Dunbar, who commands at present, intends so \as/ soon as his Men are recruited at this place, to continue his March to Philia into \for/ Winter Quarters; so that \consequently/ there will be no Men left here unless it is the poor \shattered/ remains of the Virginia Troops; who now are, & will be too small to guard our \are totally inadequate to the protection of the/ Frontiers.8 As Captn Orme is writg to yr honour I doubt not but he will give you a circumstantial acct of all things,9 which will make it needless for me to add more than that I am Honble Sir Yr most Obt & most Hble Servt
