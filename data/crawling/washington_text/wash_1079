To The Officer commanding on the South-Branch.Sir,
[Fort Loudoun, 3 June 1757]



In my letter to you of yesterdays date, I enclosed you one to Major Lewis; desiring him not to bring the Indians down if he coud possibly avoid it.1 Since that, the Honble Mr Atkin, superintendant of indian Affairs, has arrived here; and is desirous to hold a conference with them as soon as possible. The enclosed is to inform Maj: Lewis thereof:2 and I desire you will send it to the upper part of the branch to meet him upon his arrival; if he shoud come first into the Garrison, inform him of this yourselfand that he fail not in any wise to bring Mr Smith, the interpreter, with him. I am &c.
