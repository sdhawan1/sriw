[8 February 1776]



The Liberty we take in Addressing a person of so Exalted a Rank, will we persume be fully pardoned, when you perceive the Occation of it.
The Inhabitants of Nova scotia & in perticular those of the County of Cumberland have been under the Greatest A[n]xiety and Apprehension ever since the Great Contest subsisting between Great Britain and the American Colonies, Our situation has been such that we have not had it in Our Power to do any thing in Conjunctions with the other Colonies, The form of Governmt we Are under and the manner of Executing its Authority has been such that we Are Rether to be looked upon as slaves then freemen.
With Anxious desires have we been waiting for the success of your Righteous Cause, and that you woud Cast an Eye of Pity towards this forlorn part, we have indeed nothing to Recommend us, but missery and Impending destruction and devestationwe trust our manner of proceedings will have the desired Effect on you, As well as the others who Are the Instruments of supporting the Liberty of Mankind.
We have been harrased much. Occationd by Different proceedings of Government, threatend Are we, because we have such sentimts Concerning the Cause Contended for by Our brethren on the Continent, News have been Receivd that Troops will soon be sent among us, this in a manner has Roused many who were Invironed in Lethergy, Committees have been Appointed from the different Town (Including the Accadians) to fall upon some methode for safetythere being a Number among us (vainly Called Governments men) Are Continually prying into Our proceedings, and with Accumalated Tales Give Information to the Govt at HalifaxLiable therefore Are we to be Cut in Pieces, having No Expectation of success but what Comes through your ExcellencyWe Agreed in Our Committees that nothing should be done publickly As
