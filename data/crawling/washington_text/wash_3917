Dear Sir
Camp at Cambridge Octr 6th 1775.



I wrote you Yesterday of which the inclosed is a Copy.1 Since which I have been informed that your Illness has obliged you to quit the Army, and General Wooster as the Elder Brigadier, will take Rank and Command of Mr MontgomeryGeneral Wooster I am informed is not of such Activity as to press thro Difficulties, with which that Service is particularly environd. I am therefore much alarmed for Arnold, whose Expedition was built upon yours and who will infallably perish if the Invasion and Entry into Canada are abandoned by your Successor.
I hope by this Time the penetration into Canada, by your Army is effected, but if it is not and there are any Intentions to lay it aside, I beg it may be done in such a Manner that Arnold may be saved by giving him Notice and in the mean Time your Army to keep up such Appearances as may fix Carlton and prevent the Force of Canada being turned wholly upon ArnoldHe expected to be at Quebec in 20 Days from the 26th September So that I hope you will have no Difficulty in regulating your Motions with Respect to himShould this find you at Albany and General Wooster about taking the Command, I intreat you to impress him strongly with the Importance & Necessity of proceeding on2 so to conduct that Arnold may have Time to retreat.
Nothing new has occurrd since Yesterday deserving your Notice. Our next accounts of your Health I hope will be more favorableTen thousand good Wishes attend you from this Quarter, none more sincere and fervent than those of Dear Sir Your most obedt & very Humble Servt

Go: Washington
