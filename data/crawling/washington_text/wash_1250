Fredericksburg 7br 21st 1757



Nothing could have given me more Dissatisfaction than the inclosd Letter from our Friend Colo. Wm Taliaferro,1 I am informd Mr Smith has been prudent enough to send You a Coppy of the Depositions,2 he is to Day cleard honourably by a calld Court of Inquiry, neither Murder, Man Slaughter, or even Chance Med.3 found against him. I thought it my Duty to do him all the Service in my Power, tho little was by a reasonable Court wanting.
I hope this Accident (for it cannot be otherwise termd) will render him no less in yr favour, with the inclosd & other Authorities given yr good Sence will excuse Mr Smith & I little Doubt yr good Wishes for yr hble Servt
