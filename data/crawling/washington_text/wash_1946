Dear Sir
Mount Vernon 10th August 1760



Colo. Fairfaxs departure for England in a Ship for London affords me the best oppertunity imaginable to acknowledge the Receipt of your favours of the 22 Novr 12th Decr & 26 March which are all the Letters I have receivd from you since those taken notice of in mine of the 20th of Septr last.1
I must confess that my disappointment in the Sales of my Tobo pr Couzens was a very sensible one, having seen no Accts of Tobaccos by that Ship (till then) under 12 pr Hhd, & few, very few indeed that did not avarige 14 & from that to 15 & 16 pounds pr Hhd: mine being all Sweetscented and neatly managd left me no room to suspect coming in at the Tale of the Market2The discouraging Sales I have generally got for all Tobos Shipd of my own growth has inducd me to dispose of my last years Crop in the Country, the price being good and certain.3 but this may not always happen, and while I can Ship without loss I shall always be glad to have it in my power of consigning you a part. I dare say your Account Currt transmitted in Decr last is very right, altho. I shoud have understood it better had you credited me for 50 Insurd on my Tobaco pr the Integrety and made me debtor for the Premio &ca4there is another Article of Interest short 12 which I shoud be glad to have explaind;
[453]
if it is for Interest on the money you have lain in Advance for me I am extreamely willing to allow it, thinking it just and never intending to put you to the least Inconvenience on my AccountI hope before this Letter can have reachd you, that you have recoverd my loss of Goods retaken in Captn Downs.5
The French are so well Drubd, and seem so much humbld in America that I apprehend our Generals will find it no difficult matter to reduce Canada to our Obedience this Summer, but what may be Montgomerys Fate in the Cherokee Country I wont so readily determineIt seems he has made a prosperous beginning having penetrated into the Heart of their Country, and is now advancing his Troops in high health and Spirits to the relief of Fort LoudounBut let him be waryhe has a crafty Subtil Enemy to deal with that may give him most trouble when he least expects it. We are in pain here for the King of Prussiaand wish Hanover safethese being Events in which we appear to be much Interested.
My endulging myself in a trip to England depends upon so many contingencies (which in all probability never may happen) that I dare not even think of the Gratification, than which nothing is more ardently desirdbut Mrs Washington and I both woud think ourselves very happy in the oppertunity of shewing you the Virginia Hospitality, which is the most agreable entertainment we can give, or a Stranger expect to find in an Infant Woody Country, such as ours is. I am Dear Sir Yr Most Obedient Hble Servt

Go: Washington
