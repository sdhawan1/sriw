Dear Sir
Camp near Rays Town Septr 3d 1758



Yours of yesterday I have,1 you ought to have no uneasiness, you are not the cause of any delay, your friends & even those of evry Core; who know you only by Character, wish for you. I presume you know Lt Col. Stephens has been under an arrest for some time by Sr John Wildair, Stephens says he is right & will not be releasd without a publick justification,2 even Lieut. Colo. Loyd of the Pensylvanias has taken the Command from the Bly, this has mortified him much, & probably may humble his pride.3 Tomorrow Colo. Dagworthy marches with his Tatterdemalions4
[455]
& by report is to advance towards Fort Du Quesne, & there to throw up a breast work, or make some place of defence. The Genl not yet come. the 1st Inst. we had Sixty one Guns fird & three feu de joys for taking Louisburg. I wish Capt. Woodward every success, also Serjt Scott.5 I shall make evry remark in my power, but I hope to see you soon. I am Dr Sir yours Most Affectly

Wm Ramsay
