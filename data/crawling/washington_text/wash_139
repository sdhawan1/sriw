To Mr Jno. Auge Washington\Mount Vernon/Dear Jack \Brother/
[Winchester, 6 May 1755]



A very fatiegueing Ride; and long round \about/ brought me to the General (the day I parted with you)1 at Frederick Town; \This is/ a small Village 15 Miles below the blew Ridge i\o/n \the/ Maryland2\side of Potomac/ from thence we proceeded to this place, where we have halted since Saturday last,3 and shall depart for Wills Creek to morrow.
[267]
I find there is no probality of Marching the Army from Wills Creek till the latter end of this Month, or the first of next; so that you may imagine time will hang heavy \you may easily guess then how heavily time will hang/ upon my hands.4
I \have/ mee\e/t with a familiar \much/ complaisance in this Family, especially from the General; who I hope to please without \without ceremonious attentions or/ difficulty, for I may say \add/ it can scarce \not/ be done with \them/ as he uses, and requires less ceremony than you can well \easily/ conceive.5
I have orderd the Horse Gist to Bullskin, and my own here, if serviceable; otherwise you must have them \both/ carrd down when Countess is sent up: I have conceivd a good Opn of \the horse/ Gist, therefore I hope you will not let him want for proper \care & good/ usage, if he shd be s[en]t instead of the Greys; which will be the case if they are able to perform the Journey.
I hope youll \will/ have frequent oppertys to expatiate upon \to particularise/ the State of my Affairs, wch \will/ erasure6 admr no small degree of \much/ satisfn to a Person in my situation7At present I have nothing to add but my Compts to all friends, particularly \to/ the good \worthy/ Family at Belvoir8 who I hope to hear are in good health. I am Dr Jack Yr Affe Brother
