To Lieutenant Bacon, of the Maryland Independant Company.Sir,
[Winchester, 28 October 1755]



As those Stockades on Pattersons Creek, are only intended by way of cover to the Rangers, and as a Receptacle now and then for Provisions; you are desired not to plan any work, which requires much time to executeWe have neither men nor Tools, to carry on the undertaking with vigour.1 I am &c.

G:W.
