I am now so far recoverd tho far from well, that I shall set out in two days1the stripping Ticonderora so intirely of its heavy Cannon is a most unfortunate circumstance, as the transportation of em from this place is a busyness of monstrous difficulties expence and labourThe Congress have as yet not taken the least step for the security of this placethe instant I leave it, I conclude the Provincial Congress and Inhabitants in general will relapse into their former Histerics. the Men of War and Mr Tryon will return to their old stations at the wharfs and the first Regements who arrive from England will take quiet possession of the Town and Long IslandI have written letters till I am tird on the subject to the Congress, but have receivd no answerthe Committee of Three who were here to confer with me agreed it was necessary that five thoushand Men shoud be in the placeThey left us, and no notice has been taken of the affair since2great and extensive works were resolved upon and We have scarcely sufficient numbers to mark out the ground, much less to throw up the worksin short I know not what to make of this apathy on so important a subjectMessrs Price[,] Walker and since them the Volunteer Melcher are arri[v]ed from Canada3it is very lucky, for they can communicate all the necessary lights to the Congress with respect to the measures which must be taken in that Country; by their accounts nothing is so much wanted as Artillery MenCapt. Lambs Company were all taken Prisoners4I wish, indeed it is necessary, you shoud spare us a Company from BostonWe cannot possibly do without themWe have none hereI intreat, Dr General, you woud detach Capt. Badlams Companythe Capt. and I are now well acquainted and agree wonderfully
[390]
the Pensylvania and Jersey Troops marchd for Canada are good and strong in numbers5the spirit of inlisting prevails through the whole CountryI am told, but cannot believe it, that the N. England Delegates, oppose the inlisting for a year They say by means of a shorter engagement the whole Country woud be Soldiersa curious whim this! who the Devil can fill their heads with such nonsense? I should think a letter from you on the subject to either of the Adamss woud have a good effect.
I have this moment receivd yours of the 22dit is a sort of reprimand for not having more exactly informd you of the occurrencies hereI do assure you, General, that I have wrote fully and frequentlyit is true, I believe two Posts have carried no letters from me, but I woud not trouble you when I had nothing material to communicateI shall not intrench myself behind the parade of great busyness, (for my first busyness tis to be attentive to my General,) nor shall I make a plea of the loss of Palfrey, since whose departure I have been obligd to write with my own hand even, the most trifling notebut in fact, tho I confess I am naturally remiss, I have not neglected my duty in this pointI have sufferd no safe opportunity to escape mebut enough of thisI shall now give you a detail of what We have been doing and in what circumstances We areOur, force including the Minute Men, amounts to about seventeen hundred MenWards Regt which is the strongest, I have stationd in long IslandThey are employd in making fascines and preparing other materials for constructing three redouts, one of which will in great measure (in correspondence with a battery which I have sunk opposite to it in the City) will secure the entrance of the East RiverWaterburys and Stirlings Regts are quarterd in the Citythe former in the upper Barracks, the latter in the lowertwo hundred Minute Men are likewise lodgd in the TownDrakes Regt of Minute Men and one more Company (in all about two hundred) are stationd at Horns Hook which commands the pass of Hell Gate6They are employd in throwing up a redout to contain three hundred Menas to the Town, having few hands and the necessary duty being hardI have been able to effect littleI have indeed thrown down the side of the Fort next the Town to prevent its
[391]
being converted into a Citadel for the use of the Enemyit was absolutely impossible to be moulded into any thing which coud annoy their ShipsI have likewise thrown a traverse or barrier across the Broad Way two hundred yards in the rear of the fort with four pieces of Cannon to prevent the enemy lodging themselves in the remains of the Fort and repairing itit is likewise my intention to barricade all the streets leading into the Broad Way both on the right and left to secure us against being taken in reverseBatteries are to be erected on the eminence behind Trinity Church to keep their Ships at so great a distance as not to injure the town7as We are surrounded by navigable Waters, I consider enclosd Works as rather dangerousit was therefore my intention to throw up a great number of large Fleches or Redans at certain distances one behind anotherso as to render it a disputable Field of Battle against any force.8 Kings Bridge being a most important passwithout the command of which We coud have no communication with Connecticut I had resolvd to make as strong as possible such were my schemes, but as the Congress have not furnishd the Force which I was taught to expect from Philadelphia We have not had it in our Power to effect more than I have relatedGovernor Tryon and the Asia still continue betwixt Nutten and Bedlows Islandsit has pleasd his Excellency in violation of the compactHe had made to seize sevral vessels from Jersey laden with flour it has, in return pleasd my Excellency to stop all provision from the City and cut of all intercourse with hima measure which has thrown the Mayor Council and Tories into agoniesthe propensity or rather rage for paying Court to this great man is inconceivableThey cannot be weand from himWe must put wormwood on his paps, or They will cry to suck as are in their second childhoodCapt. Smith is just returnd from Fort ConstitutionHe gives a most terrible account of itthe expence of its construction has been enormous, its defects both in point of situation laying out finishing, &ca are numerousHe has made the plan of another which will command, as far as I can judge from it on paper the River effectually9I have now related as minutely as necessary our situationas I shall set out very soon it will probably be my last from this placeI must intreat once more, Dr General, that
[392]
you will spare us a company of ArtilleryBadlam seems, rather averse on proposing itAdieu, Dr Sir, Yours with the greatest respect and affection
