[Exeter, N.H., 4 January 1776]



SirA complaint being made to the Congress of this Colony by our pay-master Col. Saml Hobart Esq. residing at Medford that he has within a few Days past been extremely ill treated by a party of Colo Starks Regiment without any apparent just cause, By which means a sum of money to the amot of Two hundred & sixty pounds has been pilferd from him, and at the same time the Honour of the Colony was highly reflected upon.
We must beg leave to lay before your Excellency a Copy of Mr. Hobarts letter in wch he particularly relates his case, being the only Evidence we have at present, and to request that an
[22]
immediate Inquiry be made into the matter by such means as your Excellency may think most properthat the persons who may be found culpable, receive the Punishment their ill behaviour may meritthat this Colony may not sustain so great a loss of money, & those illiberal Reflections be wiped out by suitable acknowledgments.1
We are sorry to trouble you with these complaints at this critical time when your mind must be fully employd upon affairs of the greatest moment, but the abuse which Mr. Hobart as an officer of this Colony appears to have sufferd claims some notice and We trust will plead our Excuse.
In behalf of the Congress I am with all due Respect,
Your Excellencys
Most obt humb servt
