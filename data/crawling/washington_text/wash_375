Sir
Fredericksburg Novr 18th 1755.



I came to this place on Sunday last and intended to proceed immediately up, but receiving yours,1 and other Letters contradicting the reports lately transmitted, determined me to go to
[172]
Alexandria where I shall wait a few days in hopes of receiving the express from General Shirley, who the Govornor sent to for Commissions for the Field Officers.2
I beg that you will be particularly careful in seeing that strict Order is observd among our Soldiers, as that is the Life of Military disciplineWe now have it in our Power to enforce obedience, and obedience will be expected from us, the Men being subject to death as in the Military Law:3 The Country4 have also offerd a reward to all who will apprehend deserters, and a severe punishment upon those that shall entertain, or suffer them to pass; also upon any constable who refuses to convey them to their Quarters,5 or suffers them to Escape after such deserter is committed to their custody: these things, with the Articles of War, and a proper exhortation I would have you immediately read to the Men; and see that it is frequently done hereafter. I must desire that you will use all possible means to facilitate the Salting our Provisions; and to give the Commissary such assistance of Men &ca as he shall reasonably require: The Governor approves of the Committees resolve, in not allowing either the Maryland or Carolina Companys to be supported out of our Provisions this you are desird to make them acquainted with, and in case either of the Companys should be discharged to use your utmost endeavours to enlist so many of their Men as you can. Lieutt McManus has leave to go to carolina if he desires it. The Assembly woud make no alteration in the Militia Law,6 nor woud the Govornor order them to be draughted to compleat our Regiment; so that the slow method of Recruitg is likely to be our only means to raize the Men. I think, coud a brisk Officer and two or three Sergeants be sent among the Militia stationd on the So. Branch, they would have a probable chance of engaging many, as some seemd Inclinable in Winchester to enlist7Doctr Craik is expected round to Alexandria in a Vessel with Medicines, and other Stores for the Regiment; so soon as he arrives I shall take care to dispatch him to you.8
The Colos. Bird and Randolph are appointed Commissioners, and will set out very shortly with a present &ca to the Country of the Cherokees in order to engage them to our Interest9We have advices that the King returnd to London from Hanover on the 26th of September, that War was Proclaimed the 29th,
[173]
and that we have already taken 5 of their Men of War and 120 Sail of Merchent Mena bold stroke by Jovea glorious beginningand I hope presages our future SucessThe Man of War mentiond in my last is not yet arrivd th hourly expected; it is said (tho. I cant believe it the King not being arrivd when this ship left England) that she has Commissions for us: another Ship of War was said to be dispatchd to America immediately upon the declaration so that I have Sanguine expectations we soon shall receive them if they are not already on their way.10 I am encouragd to hope this as all the Publick Prints, private Letters, and Gentlemen from England say; that the behaviour of the Virginia Troops is greatly extold, and meets with public praises in all the Coffee Houses in London. Yea they exceed the bound of probability (which I am sorry for) by saying in the London Magazine for August, that 800 Virginians maintaind an unequal fight against 1600 French and Indians for three hours after the Regulars fled. The Generals conduct is much condemnd and the acct further saysit is not to be wonderd that those Regiments shoud act so scandalously here when their behaviour reflected such dishonour on their Country at the Battle of PrestonPans.11 I am Sir Yr most Hble Servt

Go: Washington


By return of the express that brings this, I desire to have a return of the Troops with any occurrances & the News that may have happend.
