Sir
Mount Vernon August 22d 1767



I Recievd two Letters from you this week one by Mr Whiteing the other Mr Carlyle.1 you complain I do not write to you[.] The Sunday after you left home, I lodged a Letter in Mr Carlyles Counting House & was assured it shoud be forwarded by the first opportunity, Last sunday I wrote & gave the letter to Mr Jenny who promisd me it shoud be Diliverd very shortly.2
I shall now give you as true an accompt of the Sittuation of our affairs as I can. first I shall begin with Alton. he this Day finishd Sewing Wheat, his corn is good & I think will Make as much or more than we had a right to expect from the Ground. The Ditchers are got as far as the fence that devides John [Alton] from the Miss Wades, but at present have both the Fever & Ague & not at workMorris finishes his 18 Inch Cut this day which is the second he has done the Corn in the 3 foot Cut, the Ears are tolerably large & one or more on every stock, in the 18 Inch Ears small but one [on] every Stock, in the two foot-Ears something larger & one or more on every Stock, In the 4 foot on all the single Stocks good Corn, & the others not Bad, where the ground is fresh in all the Cuts the corn is very Good, & upon the whole I think he will make a good Crop. Matt is run from him & tho. he has been once or twice seen yet we cannot get him, Bishup I believe will get done sewing wheat next week, I realy dont know how to describe his Corn well, it has a good Colour, but I think the Ears in general are small.
We have no Brick maker at worck yet nor have I heard from him lately, he was to have been here last Monday without fail, I suppose he is sick as he is not given to disappointg people3after you left home I sent the people in order to save the Timothy seed, but it was too late, for their was not a gil of seed on all
