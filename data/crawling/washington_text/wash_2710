[520]
Burns it up at the Bottom & fires at sutch a Rate that I Can Scarsly tel what to do with it and more particular on the Leaval Stiff Land wheare the foundation would not let the water sink from it for sum time it is not Quite so bad on the light or hilley Land. if providence pleases to Send us a good Rain in a little time I hope it will make a great alteration in our Crops for the Better.
