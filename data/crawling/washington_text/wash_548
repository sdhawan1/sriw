To Captain David Bell of the Virginia Regiment.
[Winchester, 10 April 1756]



As the Inhabitants of the place1 seem much alarmed, and under continued apprehensions of being attackedIt is my Orders, that you keep out constant Scouting Parties of the Light Horse, &c. in order that you may receive timely notice of the approach of the Enemy; which you are immediately to communicate to the Inhabitants. If you think you can strengthen the place where you are, by throwing up more works, you are immediately to set upon it; in order to be well prepared in case of an attack. You are to be careful not to weaken your Detachment, by sending out too large parties on the Scout; and that your men are exercised daily. Given &c. April 10th 1756.

G:W.
