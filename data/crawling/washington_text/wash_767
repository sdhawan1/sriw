Dear Sir
New Market June the 7th 1756



I should be guilty of the blackest Ingratitude did I not duly acknowledge the many Civilities I recd from you when in Winchester where I would often visit you far as it is were not my Presence at this Season of the year absolutely necessary on my Plantan. With great Reluctance I have heard that many of our Militia have deserted I shall pursue every necessary Step to have them apprehended & reconveyd to you.
My Compts to all the Gentln Officers particularly Capt. Mercer whose Behaviour I was glad to find differ so widely from a Representation given them by some of our wise or rather wrong headed legislative Body.1 Proud I am to hear Majr Stevens answers the Char[acte]r I gave you of him2 & that he may persevere in his Assiduity will be very agreeable to Dear Sr Yr most Obedt &c.

J. Baylor
