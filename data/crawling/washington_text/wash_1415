Sir
Fort George May the 17th 1758.



I have made it my Business since I Came here, to find out the past Conduct of Leiut. Steenbergen. I can plainly make it Appear by his own Books which by good fortune have fallen into my Hand, that he has Defrauded the Soldiers of their Pay in the most scandelous Manner.
As this is more then he would declare, when Examined At Winchester, I thought it my Duty Immediately to Acquaint you with it that you might take the proper measures to bring him to Justice.1 I am Sir Your most Obdt & very humble Servt

Wm Woodford
