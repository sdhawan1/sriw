[87]
Invoice of what came in this Year9 immagined you knew Better then I did that woud Serve them tho. the Calculation to Every Grown fellow & wench woud be 3 Ells of Bro. Ling to Shirt or Shift, & 5 yards of Cotten to suit for a wench or fellow there is a number of the negroes that has applyd for Shirts that had but one last year & am informd by the overseers that there Shirts was always so small in General that they were of Little or no service to them.
I have got a mill right to come & View the mill & he Says she must Be Rebuilt that she is not Sufficient to Hold a head of water & has given me a Bill of Scantling & after I have the timber Brought in place he will worke with our Carpenters at 3.15  month till I get her done I had a notion of haveing her Patched up but he thinks its runing of a great Risk so have concluded to have her Rebuilt if you think Proper & there Will Be wantg A pr of Mill Stones for the wheat mill.10
You desire to know How our Crops are frequently when I wrote to you Before they were Extreamly Likely But at this time they are much to the Contrary for we hant had a rain to wet the Ground 1 Inches since last thursday was 4 Weeks that our Tobo has moulterd Prodiously at Bottom & fird away with the Dry weather; & they are as much to the Contrary up at the new Kent Quarters they are full Wet up there, that if there woud come Rain now in a few days it woud be of Great service both to Tobo & Corn for our Crops below.
In selling our corn below people dont care to take because I dont care to take there money by count they Say it has always been taken in that way & others in Neighbourhood take money by count, therefore dont care to do it without youl take it of me in the same way which is takeing Pistereens, & as the rest of the Neighbours does it, I think we had better take it in that way for I trade but Slowly11as to the Bro. Ling & Cotten Ive had no kind of Memo. of what came in & I take it out the Bales no faster then we make Use of it as the Store house is much Pesterd wth Leather Salt & Iron &c. that I had not Room to take the goods out only as we make Use of them, that I dont know what has come in tho. am Doubtfull there wont be Linning Enough as there is Several of the People that has had Shirts out as they had but one this winter which was oblige to give them another & we were Short of Broad Hoes & if ye coud not have Spared us
[88]
some out of yr Store I must been oblige to abought[.] I Shoud amade an Exact List of the Hole but have been so very Ill wth the fever & Ague that I am Scarce Able at this time to set up But hope as you have an Exact List of negroes you can make out the cloathg & tools & Nails the Same Quantity as came in this year I believe will do another tho. think it a good way to have aplenty as it woud be Bad to buy Hose at there Extravegant Prices& as to the other Meterials I send you a list of what I can recollectplease to Excuse my desireing you to put yr Self to so much Trouble, I woud have Waited till I got better but did not know but it might make a Meterial Difference with you wch was Willing to let you know how Every thing was as quick as posable & upon receiving yr Answer if you cant conveniently do it if I Get able will let you have a list of the Hole but in case you shoud Send By a rough Draft for two much you may depend on the Greatest care Being taken of it; at a rough Calculation 896 Ells ozngs & 544 yds Cotten.12
