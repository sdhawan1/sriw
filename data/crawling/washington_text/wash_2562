Sir,
London Jan: 27. 1770.



Having determind to make an essay of the tobo trade we have bot the Liberty a new ship, which Capt. Walker now carrys out to load for us in Potomac, and as we design her to be a regular annual ship, our friends will always have a certain conveyance for their goods, & their tobo to market. Being determind to act on an upright plan, we beg the favor of your assistance to Capt. Walker, & can assure you that if we are so happy as to receive your tobo no House will be more assiduous for your interest either in the sale of yr tobo or in the purchase of your goods. If it shd be at any time convenient for you to lodge money in our hands, we shall very willingly allow you the full benefit in discounting the dutys on yr toboCapt. Walker will send to York river so that he can easily take tobos from thence & we hope you will favor us with some of yours.
Our Compts to Mrs Washington & yr family & with esteem remain Sir, yr mo: Obt Humble Servts
