To Mr Robt Jackson\Fredericksburgh/Dr Sir
[Mount Vernon, 2 August 1755]



I must acknowledge you had great reason to be terrified with the first accts that was given of our unhappy defeat, and I must
[350]
own, I was not a little surprisd to find that Governour Innis was the means of alarming the Country with a report of that \so/ extraordinary nature, without having any better confirmation of the truth, than \the story of/ an affrighted Waggeners Story1Its true, we have been beatenmost shamefully beatenby a handful of Men! who only intended to molest and disturb our March; Victory was their smallest expectation; but see the wondrous works of Providence! the uncertainty of Human things! We but a few moments before, believd our numbers almost equal to the Canadian Force, they only expected to annoy us: Yet, contrary to all expectation \& human probability/ and even to the common course of things, we were totally defeated, sustaind the loss of every thing; which they have got, are enrichend, \by it/ and strengthned \are accomodated/ by it \them/this, as you observe, must be an affecting story to the Colony; and will, no doubt, license the tongues of People to censure those \whom/ they think most blameablywhich by the by, often falls very wrongfully. I join very heartily with you in believing that when this story comes to be related in future Annals, it will meet with ridicule or \unbelief &/ indignation; for had I not been witness \to the fact/ on that fatal Day, I shd scarce \have/ give\n/ credit to it \even/ now.2
Whenever it suits you to come into Fairfax I hope you will make your home at Mount Vernon. Please to give my Compts to all enquiring Friends; and I assure you nothing coud have added greater \more to the/ satisfaction to \of/ my safe return, than hearing \of/ the friendly concern that w\h/as \been/ expressed at \on/ my supposd Death.3 I am Dr Sir Yr most Obt Servt
