To Mr Johnston, Surgeons Mate of the Virginia Regiment.
[26 December 1755]



It is Colonel Washingtons Orders, that you examine into the case of William Mitcalfe, and report if you think he is subject to Fits: Mr Roy will assist you.1
It is the opinion of Messieurs Johnston and Roy, that he is not addicted to Fits; and fit enough for Duty.
