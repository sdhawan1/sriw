Sir
Medford (Porters Tavern) [Mass.] Decemr 14. 1775



I saild from Gravesend the 4th of June last in a Merchant
[550]
ship bound to Baltimore in Maryland, which was at the time I came away the nighest passage I could get to Philadelphia, where I waited on the Gentlemen that compose the Continental Congress, in order to obtain their permit to settle my private Affairs, being much encumbered with debts, chiefly contracted in the province of New-York; in which settlement my Brother Colonel James Rogers (who lives in the Province of New York about Twenty miles West of Connecticut River) was deeply concernd, being bound for me in several sums of money, which made it necessary for me to visit him in my way home1and for that purpose came by the way of New York & Albany, to my Brothers, & from thence to Portsmouth, to my Wife & Family (a pleasure long wishd for) having been Six Years in EuropeI have taken the earliest opportunity that would permit to come to this Town (where I arrivd this morning) in order to lay before your Excellency the passport I receivd at Philadelphia from the Committee of Safety there; a Copy of which is transcribd at the Bottom of this Letter, together with the Minutes made thereon by the Committees of safety at New York & New Hampshire.2 I do sincerely entreat your Excellency for a continuance of that permission for me to go unmolested where my private Business may call me as it will take some Months from this time to settle with all my CreditorsI have leave to retire on my Half-pay, & never expect to be calld into the service again. I love North America, it is my native Country & that of my Familys, and I intend to spend the Evening of my days in itI should be glad to pay you my respects personally, but have thot it prudent to first write you this Letter, & shall wait at this place for your Excellencys commands.3 I am Sir your Excellencys most Obedient & most Humble Servant

Robert Rogers, Major
