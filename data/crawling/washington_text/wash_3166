Dear Sir,
Mount Vernon 11th April 1774



The Land may be conveyed to you at any time, & for this purpose I will bring down my title papers & leave them with you, as I go to the Assembly. When, possession can be given, I am not altogether clear in, as I believe Mr Fitzhugh & Mr Hunter look upon the tillable & Pasture Land as engaged to them till the Fall; but Colo. Lewis can give you the best information on that head, as it was with him the Agreement was made. I apprehended their time was up last Fall, but in my way from Wmsburg in Decr last, Mr Hunter told me, that by his
[28]
agreement with Colo. Lewis, he was to have notice of my wanting the place by seed time, & in case of failure, was to consider it as engaged to him another year; this I did not understand from Colo. Lewiss account, previous to my conversation with Mr Hunter; & since, I have had no opportunity of mentioning the matter to him; but whatever agreement he made, I shall think myself bound byIf neither of those Gentlen put Corn into the Land, their winter Grain must soon come off; & I shoud think they could have no use for the fields afterwards, & as to the other parts of the Land, they have not, or ever had any pretence to them.1 I am, Dr Sir Yr most Obt Servant
