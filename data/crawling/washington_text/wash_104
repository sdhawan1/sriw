Dr Sir
Camp att Wills Creek [Md.] 8th Septr 1754



Your favour of the 4th Septr1 I received this moment but as yett have not Seen Major Stephens. as for my giving you Orders to proseed here I cannot See to what purpose without you have your Regiment Complete, here being Suffiscent to guard the place if I had any Tools to work with to throw up a proper Intrinchment.2 I have mounted Five Guns which is all I cann do. Nor cann I gett as much as A Spaid to Trench Rownd my Tent, though I have recomended the getting of Tools to do Camp Dewty ever Since my first Account of the Stores. I have recomended what I think may be done this Winter. & if we be Strong Enough before the Winter Setts in Strong, or perhaps it may prove a favourable Winter then we may do our Business Before they gett Stronger: You may depend the French do not Slip there time though I am ashamed to Say I think we have. & Next year you may Depend they will be Suffiscently Strong to hold you Way with all the Forces that liakly may be Sent against them. you may depend they will have boeth men & Stores Sent them in time from home. I Shall allways be glad to hear from you. I am Dr Sir Your Mostt Hube Sevtt
