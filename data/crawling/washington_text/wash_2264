Gentlemen
Gunston-Hall 23d Decemr 1765.



Inclosed is the Scheme I promised You for altering the Method of replevying Goods under Distress for Rent: I thought it necessary to explain fully the Land-lords Right by the common-Law, to shew that our Act of Assembly was a mere Matter of Indulgence, & that an Alteration of it now will be no Incroachment upon the Tenant:1 the first Part of it has very little to do with the Alteration proposed, & only inculcates a Doctrine I was always fond of promoting, & which I coud wish to see more generally adopted than it is like to be:2 the whole is indeed much longer than it might have been, but that You will excuse as a natural Effect of the very idle Life I am forced to lead.3 I beg You will alter such parts of it as either of You think exceptionable.4
If I had the Act of Assembly obliging our Vestry to pay for the Glebe &c. I woud prepare a Petition for Redress, & get it signed in Time.5
Wishing the Familys at Belvoir & Mount-Vernon all the Mirth & Happiness of the approaching Festival, I am Gentm. Yr most obdt Hble Sert

G. Mason
