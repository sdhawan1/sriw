To Mrs Washington\near Fredg/ Honourd Madm
[Fort Cumberland, Md., 18 July 1755]



As I doubt not but you have heard of our defeat, and perhaps have had it represented in a worse light (if possible) than it deserves; I have taken this earliest oppertunity to give you some acct of the Engagement, as it happend within 7 miles of the French Fort on Wednesday the 9th Inst.
We Marchd onto that place witht any considerable loss, havg only now and then a stragler pickd up by the French Scoutg Indns.1 When we came there, we were attackd by a body of French and Indns whose number (I am certain \persuaded/) did not exceed 300 Men;2 ours consisted of abt 1,300 well armd Troops; chiefly of the English \Regular/ Soldiers, who were struck with such a panick, that they behavd with more cowardice than it is possible to conceive; The Officers behavd Gallantly in order to encourage their Men, for which they sufferd greatly; there being near 60 killd and wounded; a large proportion out of the number we had!3 The Virginia Troops shewd a good deal of Bravery, & were near all killd; for I believe out of 3 Companys that were there, their is scarce 30 Men left alive; Capt. Peyrouny & all his Officers down to a Corporal was killd; Capt. Polson shard near as hard a Fate, for only one of his was left:4 In short the dastardly behaviour of those they call regulars, exposd all others that were inclind to do their duty to almost certain death; and at last, in dispight of all the efforts of the Officers to the Contrary, they broke, and run as Sheep pursued by dogs; and it was impossible to rally them. The Genl was wounded; of wch he died 3 Days after; Sir Peter Halket was killd in the Field:5 where died many other brave Officers; I luckily escapd witht a wound, tho I had four Bullets through my Coat, and two Horses shot under me; Captns Orme & Morris two of the Genls Aids de Camp\s/, were wounded early in the Engagemt which renderd
[337]
the duty hard\er/ upon me, as I was the only person then left to distribute the Genls Orders,6 which I was scarcely able to do, as I was not half recovered from a violent illness that \had/ confind me to my Bed, and a Waggon, for above 10 Days; I am still in a weak and Feeble condn which induces me to halt here 2 or 3 Days in hopes of recovg a little Strength, to enable me to proceed homewards;7 from whence, I fear I shall not be able to stir till towards Sepr, so that I shall not have the pleasure of seeing you till then, unless it be in Fairfax; please to give my love [to] Mr Lewis and my Sister, & Compts to Mr Jackson and all other Fds that enquire after me. I am Hond Madm Yr most Dutiful Son

P.S. You may acqt Priscilla Mullican that her Son Charles is very well, havg only recd a slight wd in his Foot wch will be curd witht detrimt to him in a very small time. We had abt 300 Men killd and as many, or more, wounded; and this chiefly done by our own Men.8
