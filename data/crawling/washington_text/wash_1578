My Dear Sir
Cresaps [Md.] augt 5th 1758



I last night had the pleasure of receiving your very agreeable and obliging favour by Mr Gist, 15 of the men that he brought down with him Joind to the old Guard Escorts the waggons with the Remainder of the Ball to Fort Cumberland.1
Jenkins with a Corporal & 6 Horse set out from here highly pleasd with his Escort[.] I gave the Corporal orders to see him over Spring Gap Mountain and much farther as the old Gentn should judge necessary[.] as theres no Signs of the Enemy lately discoverd I hope hell get down save.2
Last night Tom Joind me without arms and destitude of every necessary, I have returnd McKinzie of Capt. Woodwards Compy in his room but as McKinzie did not care to part with his Regimentals Im at loss how to get a Coat & Jacket for Tom as many of our men must soon, one way or other be provided for I imagined a Coat and Jacket might be spard without any inconvenience to the Service.3
The Intelligence of our affairs you are pleasd to favour me with gives me the deepest concernOur once well grounded hopes will too probably be Blasted and the Glorious Prospect that once appeard so full in view will I dread be intersepted by Clouds of Gloomy Disappointments But as Genl Renchild told Peter the Great it is our Bussiness to obey4I wish to Heaven it was possible you coud have a Conference with the GeneralMy heart BleedsI dare not proceedI ever am with the most perfect & unalterable esteem & regard My Dear Colo. your mo: affecte & mo: obt hble Servt
