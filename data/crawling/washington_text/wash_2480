Mount Vernon Jany 12th 1769



In looking over my order (of the 20th of June last) for Goods, I perceive that I have omitted sending for Dutch Blanketting for the use of my Estate on Potomackan Article I much want, and
[160]
must beg the favour of you to send me by the first Ship bound to this River. Three pieces are requisite; and if they cannot be got here (in a vessel to Potomack) by the middle or last of October, I must, in that case, desire they may be sent to York or James River to the care of Mr Joseph Valentine; as some of my People will suffer greatly for want of them, if they do not come to my hands before Winter setts in.1 From him I can fall upon some method to fetch them; although it woud be vastly more desireable to receive them by a Vessel directly to this River if any such shoud offer. I am Gentn Yr Most Hble Servt

Go: Washington
