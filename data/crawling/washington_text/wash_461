Greenway Court. Jany 4: [1756].



The Bearer hereof Capt. Bailis is now going up to Joyn the Prince Wm Detatchment, by Order of Colo: Lee he Applyd to me for a discharge which I Refusd, as I daly Expect to hear from you.1 He Informs me that the Men are almost Naked and as the Expence of mentaining them is very great, I think they ought to be discharged, as soon as it can be done with Safty. I am Sir Your very Humbl. Servt
