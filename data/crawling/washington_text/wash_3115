As my Friend the Honble George Wm Fairfax Esqr. has long since acquainted you with his arrival & of his Situation at York my Congratulations on the occasion will come very late however they are very Sincere & the Proverb says better late than never. By a Letter which I have lately received from him I find both himself & his Lady have had a kind of seasoning, indeed we have had a very extraordinary variable Winter one day a severe Frost & the next sometimes very close & Foggy however they were both pretty well recovered & seem in very good Spirits.

I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your several Favors of the 25th Sepr & 15th octor last & to acquaint you that the Letters they coverd & the two Packages from Capt. Boucher are forwarded to your Friend Mr Fairfax at York.1
If there should be any Tobo for the Neptune this year I shall take it as a particular Favor if you would write to my Friend Colo. Nelson at York that Capn Punderson on his arrival knowing the Quantity may immediately dispatch Craft for them I hope to get him away sometime in March.2
