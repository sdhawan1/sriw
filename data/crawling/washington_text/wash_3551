Philadelphia, 26 July 1775



We recommend our Countryman Mr Edmund Randolph to your patronage and favor. ... You will readily discern Sir, how important a consideration it is, that our Country should be furnished with the security and strength derived from our young Gentry being possessed of military knowledge, so necessary in these times of turbulence and danger.
