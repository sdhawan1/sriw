Sir
New York May 17. 1776



As I have no doubt of the Willingness of the Militia of this City to Join in Its defence against the Attempts of the Enemies of America; It is highly necessary in order to avoid confusion in the time of any alarm that the Posts of the Several Regiments of Militia be fixed on in Conjunction with those of the Continental Army, and that they be allotted to the Brigades most convenient to their several situations; and as I am now arranging that part of the Business of the army, It will I presume be proper that directions be given to the Commanding Officers of the Several Corps to take the Stations I shall assign, and to obey the Orders they may in time of danger receive from me or the Brigadier Generals of the Continental Army. the like measure will be equally necessary with regard to the Militia of Kings County & part of Queens County on Long Island, and also the Militia of Staten Island, and I am persuaded that the mention of a matter so Obviously necessary will be sufficient to Induce the Congress of this province to give such directions as are proper on this Occasion.1 I have the honor to be with great respect Sir Your Most Obedt Servt

Go: Washington
