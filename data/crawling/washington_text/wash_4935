Gentlemen
[New York] April 201776



I thank you for the polite and ready Attention you paid to my requisition of the 17th Instant.1 When the Civil & Military Powers Co-operate, and afford mutual Aid to each other there can be little doubt of things going well. I have now to request the favor of your information, in what manner, and in what time a Body of 2000 or 2500 Militia might be collected from this Colony for actual Service upon any sudden Emergency.
Although we may not, and I trust in God shall not have occasion for their Aid, common prudence does nevertheless dictate the expediency of a preconcerted Plan for calling them in, that in Case of necessity they may be drawn together in proper Corps without tumult or disorder, and at the same time with the utmost Expedition. This will not be the Case if
[99]
men are not regularly embodied and notified that they are to step forth at a moments warning.
The Idea that strikes me as the properest to be pursued at present, is, to establish out of the Continental Forces, good lookouts on the heighths and Head Lands at the Entrance of the Harbour, who, upon the appearance of a Fleet shall make such signals as being answered from place to place, shall convey the earliest intelligence to Head Quarters of the Strength and approach of the Enemy. These Signals, for greater certainty to be followed by Expresses, and then, in Case any thing formidable should appear, for the Committee of Safety if sitting, if not, those to whom the power shall be delegated, upon application from the Commanding Officer of the Continental Forces to Order in two or more Battallions as the exigency of the Case may require or for greater dispatch such Militia or part of them as shall be allotted to this Service by the Committee might be assembled (if in the Town or Vicinity[)] by Signals to be agreed on.
A mode of proceeding of a similar kind, concerted with Jersey would bring in a reinforcement speedily and without those irregularities and unnecessary Expences which but too frequently attend the movement of Militia.2
Thus Gentlemen I have expressed my Sentiments to you upon the occasionYour Prudence will suggest to you the necessity of adopting these, or other Methods of a like nature and your wisdom will point out the most effectual and expeditious manner of carrying them into ExecutionI therefore submit them to your Consideration and am with great respect Gentlemen Your most obedient & very humble Servant

Go: Washington
