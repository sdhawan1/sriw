To Capt. PeachyDr Sir,
[Fort Loudoun, 18 September 1757]



Your favour of the 22d ultimo came to hand about 4 days ago.
In answer to that part which relates to Colo. Corbins gross and infamous reflections on my conduct last spring; it will be needless I dare say to observe further at this time, than that the liberty which he has been pleased to allow himself, in sporting with my character, is little less than a comic-entertainment, discovering at one view, his passionate fondness for your friendHis inviolable love of truth; his unfathomable knowledge! and the masterly strokes of his wisdom in displaying it. These several talents he has I think exhibited in a most conspicuous manner to every person who was in the least degree acquainted with
[415]
the situation of affairs in this county at that juncture. The report of your false musters is equally absurd; and may take credit as above.
You are heartily welcome to make use of any letter or letters, which may at any time have been written to you: for, altho I keep no copies of Epistles to my friends;1 nor can remember the contents of all of them; yet I am sensible that the narrations are just; & that truth and honesty will appear in my writings; of which, therefore, I shall not be ashamed, tho criticisms may censure my stile.
Mr Bod2 is now in Augusta. I am perswaded he told me that the Governor forbad his paying you for the month of June. I have nevertheless certified, that you did duty until sometime in July; and wish it had been your lot to have continued with.
That our poor friends Spotswood, & Benj. Bullet are lost, is a truth (I believe) too certain. I am &c.

G:W.
Fort Loudoun, Septr 18th 1757.
