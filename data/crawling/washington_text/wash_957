Winchester, Sunday 31st October, 1756.



Officers commanding Companies to set about making out their pay-rolls, in order to have them ready; as Captain Mercer is expected in town this night. So soon as the waggons arrive in town they are to be employed on the Fort; as they can not possibly go to-morrow.1
