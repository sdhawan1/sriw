Dr Sir
New York May 17. 1776



Your favor of the 14 Instant I received this morning and am exceedingly sorry for the sad reverse of fortune in our Affairs in Canadathey are rather alarming, But I still hope our vigorous
[329]
exertions will be attended with success, Notwithstanding the present unpromising appearances, & that we shall yet acquire & maintain possession of that Country, so important to us in the present contest.
I have Transmitted the Intelligence to Congress with your Orders from Genl Schuyler,1 whose direction you must follow, till I send you their determination or my commands to the Contrary. I am Dr Sir &c.

G.W.
