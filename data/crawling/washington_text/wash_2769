There is no sartanty yeat of the Charters Government taking place as was proposed when you was at Fort pitt or of Colo. Craughans Grant being confirmd and som Disputs it being ever Confirmd and I hear no talk of the Traders having Any Land on the Ohio There is som talk of a government to be on the Ohio at the Mouth.3
I Shall do my Endeaviour to Keep your Land I took up for you but I am a fraid I Shall be hard put to it, but I have Built four good Cabins on it, and Cleard about an Acre of Land at Each Cabin fit for the Plough which I think will hold it till there is som way of Securing it farther.4
I have Seen McMahons Land he had to Seell but it was not Such as it was Recomended to me and be sids there is a Disput about part of it a man has Built a Cabin on the best of it but if it had not a bin so it would not suted you it is two Hilly and not Rich neither.5
There will be [no] Posability of taking up Such a Quantity as you want near Fort pitt as there is Such numbers of People out now Looking for Land and one takeing Each others Land from him as soon as a mans back is turnd an other is on his Land the man that is strong and able to make Others Afraid of him Seems to have the best Chance as tims go now Probaly I may fall in with such a body of Land on som of the Small Creeks Down the Ohio if so I will take it for you and as soon as I can I will send you a Draft and Description of the Place. I am Sir your Hume Sarvant
