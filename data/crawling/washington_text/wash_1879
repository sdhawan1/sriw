Maurice Pound a Native of Germany having setled at Colchester in the said County about three years since on two Lotts which he purchased (one of which he has improved according to Law) and planted a Vineyard on them; during which time he has lived at his own Expence without any profit from his Vineyard having been much retarded in his Undertaking by these two last dry summers, & having one of his Lots yet to save by building the legal Improvements; with a winepress and other
[369]
Conveniencys, proposes to any Gentlemen who are desirous to help him, & encourage & promote an Undertaking likely to be so usefull, & beneficial to this Colony to oblige himself to improve his other Lott, & to mortgage both the said Lotts to any Gentlemen who will advance him one hundred pounds Current money the Interest of which he proposes to pay yearly & the principal sum Advanced within five years, & the whol time to prosecute with Industry all measures possible to bring his Vineyard to perfection, (a thing not [to] be done at once) of which he has a most encouraging prospect if seasons will permit. N.B. the Lotts to be mortgaged to any one or more of the Subscribers in Trust1 for allI have known Maurice Pound ever since he lived in Colchester he has the Character of a very honest industrious man: I have been frequently in his Vinyard upon which he has mutilated an infinite deal of Labour, & I realy believe if our Soil & Climate is capable of producing good wine that he will, wth proper Encouragement, bring it to perfecti[o]n tho I dont think less then 150 will doas I am Sensible that his present Circumstances are too low to carry on his undertaking without Assistance & from my Opinion of the Intigrity a[nd] Capacity of the man, I will advance him ten Pounds upon the above mentioned Terms & I will readily join with the other Subscribers in making up whatever Sum they shall judge necessary for the purpose.
