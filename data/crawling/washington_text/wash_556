Wood & Family desert his Fortification & Plantation to the great Discouragement of Others.3 I hope the Cash Mr Kirkpatrick carrys will enable You to keep your Soldiers in due Obedience and make all possible Efforts towards repelling & vanquishing the restless Enemy of our Country.4 Will not the Marylanders act against our common Invaders! who come over Potomack from their Province which They first pass throughMajor Dobbs returnd thother Day to his Father whence He is to proceed wth two hundred Soldiers to N. York there to receive Genl Shirleys Orders5who if not assisted Soon from Home is unlikely to begin the concerted Operations wth Success.
