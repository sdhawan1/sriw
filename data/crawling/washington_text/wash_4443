You will excuse me for reminding you of our conversation the other evening, when I informd you that General Lees departure for New York is advisable upon the Plan of his Letter, & under the Circumstance I thene mentiond, ought not to be delayed. In giving me your opinion of this matter I have no doubt of your takeing a comprehensive view of it. That is you will not only consider the propriety of the measure, but of the execution. wheter such a step, tho right in itself may not be lookd upon as beyond my Line&c.&ca.1
If it could be made convenient & agreable to you to take Pot Luck with me to day I shall be very glad of your company & we can then talk the matter over at LargePlease to forward Genl Lees Letter to me. I am&c.

G.W.
