Cambridge 14 December 1775.



I beg leave to recommend to your kind notice Monsieurs Pennet and De Pliarne two French Gentlemen who came here last night. . . . I pray the favor of you to supply them with such necessaries as they may want and have Carriages provided for expediting their journey as much as possible.
