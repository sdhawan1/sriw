Gentlemen
[New York] June 26.1 1775.



At the same time that with you I deplore the unhappy Necessity of such an Appointment, as that with which I am now honoured, I cannot but feel sentiments of the highest Gratitude for this affecting Instance of Distinction & Regard.
May your warmest wish2 be realized in the Success of America at this important and interesting Period; & be assured that, every Exertion of my worthy Colleagues & myself, will be equally extended to the re establishment of Peace & Harmony between the Mother Country and the3 Colonies. As to the fatal, but necessary Operations of War.4 When we assumed the Soldier, we did not lay aside the Citizen, & we shall most sincerely rejoice with you in that happy Hour, when the Establishment of American Liberty on the most firm, & solid Foundations, shall enable us to return to our private Stations in the bosom of a free, peaceful, & happy Country.

Go: Washington.
