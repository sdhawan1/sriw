Dear Sir
Winchester Decemb. 12th 1758



The Baggage arrivd here the night before last but the horses so low and Jaded as they could not proceed before this day I have sent Keating & two others to see it safe to the Quarter.1
Theres no place to receive the Sick and that there should be no Surgeon or Nurses to take care of the Sick & wounded appears shockingly Barbarous.
Mr Smith says theres no materials to finish the Barracks & no money to procure them, those that stays in the Fort must suffer greatly for want of Wood & wateras the men are in great
[168]
want of necessaries would you think proper to have the Shirts and Stockgs in the Store Issued to them.
Mr Boyd got here last night, he parted with our Troops at Reas Town and says that before he left them eight or nine had Parishd with Cold, and that the Sick Encreasd fast.2
My Fever still continues and nobody here that can give me the smallest Releif nor is it diminishd by the Intelligence we had of the Assemblys Determination about our Regt (if it now may be calld one). the very name of Ranger is horrible. its Duty if well executed insupportable by at least 9/10ths of the Human Species, its nature inconsistent with order & Discipline and that Brave Corps equally Distinguishd by their Discipline and Intrepidity before the Enemy will too probably soon dwindle to a Licentious Crowd3as I would willingly make every effort to secure some kind of Retreat from what I so much dislike I would (if it should not appear like an abuse of that good nature & disinterested Friendship so often Demonstrated in my behalf) Beg you would be so good as to use your Interest with the Governor to make me an Adjutant to the Militia this the late Governor often told me should be a back door for me in case I should be disappointed in my military expectations which (he added) could not well happen[.] I am told there is a vacancy and a total ignorance of the Service must render some of those that enjoy them very unequal to the officeI know how disagreeable it is to ask a favour of a great man and nothing but dire necessity could induce me to beg your doing itfrom the present Circumstances of Affairs and your Situation in Life Im perswaded such a favour at this juncture would not be refusd you. I am really ashamd at my giving such great & frequent trouble indeed it seems odd I should give you the most who is best disposd to do for me, tho that its natural cause.4
I shall ever retain the most grateful sense of the manifold Friendly & obliging offices you have been pleasd to do me, to merit which will always comprehend a large share of his ambition who is with the most perfect & unalterable Esteem My Dear Colo. Your most Affecte & most obliged hble Servant

Robert Stewart


my present Situation will I hope render an appology for my writing &ca badly unnecessary.
