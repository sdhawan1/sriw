Sir,
Williamsburg 3d April 1761



Several of your favours now lye before me, but the last of Novr 9th I shall particularly take notice of1with astonishment then did I receive the Account of Sales of that Hhd Tobo pr the Everton where only 8.4.1 is renderd for it2 at the sametime that Mr Cary was selling the like Tobo at 17 & 18 a Hhd. As to the exceptions which for two or three years past you have made to the quality of the Tobacco, give me leave to say Sir tis altogether inconsistentWe continue the same management as usual, and the Tobo Consignd you has been made at the same Plantationsby the same handsand under the same Overseers as that sent Mr Caryno picking or choosing of Hhds has ever been allowd of, but promiscuously taken for both as the Ships has a demand for ithe never gives less than twelve but generally Sixteen pounds a Hhd tis unreasonable therefore to expect I can continue a Corrispondance under such obvious Disadvantages. I am Sir Yr Most Obedt Servt

Go: Washington
