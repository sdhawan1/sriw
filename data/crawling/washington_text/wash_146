To Mrs Fairfax\Belvoir/Dear Madam.
[Fort Cumberland, Md., 14 May 1755]



I have, at last, with great pains and difficulty, discoverd the Reason why Mrs Wardrope1 is a greater favourite of \with/ Genl Braddocks than Mrs Fairfax; and met with more respect at the late review, in Alexandria.2
The cause I shall communicate, after rallying you for neglecting the means that introduced her to his favour which, to say truth was, in part \means which produced the effectand what do you think they were?why, nothing less I assure you than/ erasure a present of dilicious Cake, and potted Wood cocks; that wrought such wonders illegible upon the Heart of the General as well as upon those of the gentlemens that they became instant Admirers \which so affected the palate, as to leave a deep impression upon the hearts of all who tasted of themHow then could the General do otherwise than admire/, not only of the charms, but of the Politeness of this Fair Lady.
We have a favourable prospect of halting here three Weeks or a Month longer for Waggons, Horses and Forage; so that i\I/t is easy to conceive \therefore that/ my situation will \not/ be very pleasant and agreeable,
[280]
when I dreaded this (before I came out) more than every \all the/ other Incident\s/ that might happen \during/ in the Campaigne.3
I hope you will favour me with your corrispondance since you see my willing desiresouss \ness/4 to deserve the Honour, and of approveing myself Your most Obedt & most Humble Servt

Go: Washington
