Mount Vernon Janry 17th 1776



I did not write to you last Post owing to an accident I went over to Maryland to indeavour to get Adamss Negroe Fellowhe being out of the way, & the family either did not know or pretended they coud not tell where he wasbut supposed he was looking out for some one to purchase him, or hire him, I was unwilling to come away without seeing him, which kept me longer in maryland than I expected & when I attempted to return, was prevented for some time by wind & SeeThe Post was gone before I returnd. The fellow I see & he promised to be here on Monday or tuesday at farthest but as yet he is not come, altho I think he will still come for he has not the look of a Runaway Negroe. I mentiond in a former letter I was then going over after him, I was prevented by Indisposition, & sent Bishup overbut the Fellow kept out of the wayhe told Bishup he had much rather be hangd than come to Verginia1I got Dr Craik to Advertise the Land to Rentnot meetg with a proper Tenant, he since Christmass has Rented it to Adams for 25Maryland Curcy and took security for the payment of the RentYour Letter of the 25th Dembr I have
[127]

Cleveland for her & gave him to understand that I woud have herupon which she was sentshe is now at George Townher Lock was broke& she wanted Screws&c.She is too small to shoot with Certainty more than 100 yds altho he & Stevens say she will kill a Dear 200 yds every shothe does not give so particular a description of the Land as you desire. he says it is all very good, & will have one very great Advantage, The land adjoing is very Broken & poor so that it will always be a good place for Range.4 you shoud let me know in time whether you intend to send in the Spring to have the Rest of your Land saved from forfeiture, or whether these troublesome times is
[128]
not a Sufficent excuse for not doing it. Woud not Stephens be a proper person to send out5I shoud think with the negroes you have there, the Land might be saved without hireg any More white men, or at least not more than one or twoCleveland talks of going out to the Kantuckythis Spring in pursuit of Land for himselfThe Brick Layers are about the Chimney Tops. I suppose you do not mean to have the Chimney, of the Store House, & the other House opposite capd with stone alsoThe Wall of the new Garden Adjoing the Quarter is 178 feetthe Octagon is exactly half the distanceI cannot inform you what is done with the PainterColo. Lewis promised to get him soldif he does not, I wrote to Mr Hill to do it.6 I fancy Dr Mercer has not payd his Bond to you, for the Other Day I got a Letter from Blair putg me in mind of his haveg your Bond which ought to have been paid before thisColo. Lewis wrote me he woud recieve of Mercer & pay to Blair, why he has not I cannot tell, I have not heard from him since the first of Dembr7you Ask me if there is no one you coud give a power of Attorney tothat woud secure Barrauds debt for youyou can Best tell that yourself, being much better Acquainted with the people in that part of the World, I understood by you I think, or by Colo. Lewis, that Newton was to do itwhether he has or not, done any thing in it, I no not for altho I sometimes have wrote to him about it he never answers my Lettershe wrote to me by Mr Custis when he come from Wmsburg that if he coud get any money he woud send it to me. Norfolk is now in Ashes, which I suppose will make it more difficult to collect the money that is due, for Flour Sold by Newtonfor in all probability it was sold to Bakers whose whole Estate lay in the Town & depended upon their trade altogether ever to put it in their power to pay their Debtsif things shoud have a more favourable prospect towards the Spring, than at presentwoud it not be a good way for me to go to Williamsburg when the Convention Meets, or Merchants, or at a time when Both Newton & Barraud was to be seen there, & make some inquiry about the State of your affairs with themfor it seems difficult to get any one to do it, so as to give any Satisfactory information8I sold some ship Stuff to Goodrich, which was to have been paid for in Octobr last upwards of 30 of that money is
[129]
still due, the communication between this & him, is intirely cut offI cannot tell how I am to get the money.9
