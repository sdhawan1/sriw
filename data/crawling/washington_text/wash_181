I arrived at Home the day before yesterday, without meeting with an Egachee,2 or any other remarkable event. I calld at Belhaven3 \on/ purposely to acquaint Majr Carlyle with your desire, who will use all possible means to procure a Vessel though I fear it will be somewhat difficult \to do it/ at present, as the Shipping have \are/ most of them employd, in transporting the Tobo from the difft Warehouses.4 \to Europe./
It is impossible to relate the difft accts that was \were/ given of our late unhappy Engagemt; but all \all of which/ tendd, greatly to the disadvantage of the poor deceasd Genl, who is censurd on all hands.5 As I have no certn conveyance for this Letter I shall only add my sincere compts to Morris, Burton, Gage & Dobson6 and shall take an\nother/ oppertunity of writg to you at Philidelphia, and of being more particular, I am my Dear Orme Your truely Affe
