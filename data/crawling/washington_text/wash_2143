Mount Vernon 4th Octr 1763.



Since mine of the 27th Ulto Captn McGachin who will do me the favour to deliver this, and who for several years past has commanded a Convict Ship into this River (a service neither consistent with his Inclinations or Health to persevere in) has expressed a desire of being recommended to the Command of the Ship which you have given us Reasons to expect into Potomack1A Request I do most readily comply with, because a personal acquaintance with Mr McGachin added to his general good Character enables me to introduce him to you as a Gentleman of known skill, deligence and Integrety; and who by a long use to the Trade, and this River in particular, has contracted a general acquaintance and mutual friendship with the best Gentlemen on it; as such then he has my warmest wishes to your employ; and I am perswaded if you are not pre-engaged, you cannot light upon a Master who will act more for your Interest, or will give more universal satisfaction to your corrispondants on the River than he willshoud he be so fortunate to succeed then, I think I can venture to assure you that he will stand in no need of particular Addresses; his knowledge of the Business, and acquaintance with the Gentlemen rendering it not only unnecessary but perhaps detremental to your InterestYou will be so good as to excuse the liberty I have taken, and do me the Justice to beleive that I am quite disinterested in this recommendationas much so however as a Man can be who wishes to see his property committed to the managemt of a Person in whose care he can confideI am Gentn Yr Most Obedt Servt
