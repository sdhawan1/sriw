Speirs & Smith have got a thousand Shirts and engages to supply any qty of Flannels, half thicks Shoes and Stockgs and thinks they can get you about 200 Blankets in 6 or 7 days but the Blankets they cannot engage for and would be glad to know as soon as possible what qty of each kind you will want to whom they will deliver the Goods & how they are to be sent up I have with difficulty prevaild upon them not to part with any till they hear from you.4
