To Mr Jno. Auge Washington\Mount Vernon/Dear Jack \Brother/
[Fort Cumberland, Md., 7 June 1755]



As much \as I am/ hurried as I am at present, I cant think of leaving this place without writing to you; tho I have no time to be particular. I was Escorted by 8 Men of the Militia from Winchester to this place \Camp/; which 8 Men were 2 Days assembling; but I believe they woud not have been more than as many seconds dispersing if I had been attacked.1 Upon my arrival here, I found \that/ Sir Jno. St Clair with a body of 500 Men were \had/ Marchd to prepare the Roads, lay a deposit of Provisions at the little Meadows, and to erect some kind of defensive work there.
Tomorrow Sir Peter \Halket/ with the first Brigade \begin/ Begin2 their March, and on monday the General and the 2d will follow.3 We have no certain acct \intelligence/ from the Ohio: but have advices from Philidelphia that a body of 300 F\rench/: passd Oswego in \o/ their way to Fort Duquisne, and that a larger Detachment was hourly expected.4 A Captn of Sir Peters Regimt with several of the common Soldiers of the different Corps has died \have died/ since our Incampmt here, and many others are now sick with a kind of Bloody Flux.5 I wrote \to you/ from Winchester a Letter which I \&/ hope you have receivd6 \itI/ and shoud be glad of an answer as soon as possible; any Letters to me, directed to the care of Mr Cox at Winchester,7 will be certain of a conveyance[.] I am Dr Jack Yr most Affe Brothr
