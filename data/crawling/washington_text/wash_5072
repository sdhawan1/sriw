[New York] May 12, 1776. Being the officer of the guard at the old City-Hall over the prisoners confined by order of the Provincial Congress, I was very disagreeably surprised by a very tumultuous noise, occasioned by the mob bringing a certain Charles Oliver Bruff, on suspicion of being a Tory, who is now in my custody. Asks for GWs orders regarding Bruff.1
