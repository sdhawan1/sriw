The Shoes which you sent me last fitted very well,2 but were in my opinion very ill shapd; at least they do not please my taste as I am not fond of either long, or low hind Quarters, or sharp ToesI beg that none of the Shoes you now, or hereafter may send me, may be made of Dogskin unless particularly required to be so. I am Sir Yr Hble Servt

Go: Washington


P.S. Mr Custis desires his Shoes may be made long & low in the hind QuartersIn short that they may be made fashionable.
