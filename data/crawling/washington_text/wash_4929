Cambridge, 20 April 1776. Requests payment for service as a chaplain in the Continental army. I left my congregation 200 miles without a single dollar for my support . . . I laboured near 4 months without provision or pay but charge but three being ill some part of the time. . . . I deliverd in my Bill to General Sulivan, who promisd to deliver it to Your Excellency but by his sudden march for New York, I presume he forgot itFor the payment of this small pittance I presented two petitions to your Excellency by the hand of Squire Mayland who returnd me for answer that your Excellency could not grant an Order without the Names of the Col. or Colos. to the Bill.1
