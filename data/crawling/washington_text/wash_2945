Sir
Norfolk June 30. 1773.



I received yours of 14th will take care that your Letter to Mr M Mikin shall be forwarded by a vessell that will sail in a few days.1 I
[252]
now send you the prices of the flour herrings & ship stuf sold for which I hope youl approve off.2 the first quantity is not all sold yet tho. there is but few barrels left. I am realy at a loss what I shall do with the midlings as the Bakers will not touch them & they will not answer at the West India markets. I am now fitting a vessell for Madeira where I have been informd they will answer, if you incline to send them I will ship them for you, your answer will much oblige me by the first post as I expect the vessell will sail in a few weeks.3 We have no demand for ship stuff at present but if you incline to send what you have on hand imagine I coud get ten shillings & freight down for it. I am yr Hble Servt

Thomas Newton Junr
