Dr General
Hartford January the 15th 177[6]



Major French whom I have met with at Hartford, is extremely solicitous for permission to return home, as He is confident
[95]
that his whole fortunes depend upon his being immediately on the spot with his Friends at this instant as He is, I believe, a Man of strict honour his Parole not to serve for a given time against the Freedom of America woud be sufficient securityand as He has a Family to provide for it woud certainly be humane and charitable to indulge him, nor can I see any inconvenience which woud attend the indulgencethere may be some objections which do not perhaps occur to me, but I coud wish for my own part that as so much depends upon it, He might be gratifyd. however I beg You will excuse my submitting the matter to your consideration.1 I am, Dr General, Your most obedt humble, Servt

Charles Lee
