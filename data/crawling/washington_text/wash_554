To Captain David Bell, at Conogochieg.Sir,
[Winchester, 1415 April 1756]



It is my Orders that you send out Scouting Parties of the Light Horse as often as it can possibly be done, without too much fatiguing them. And you must order them to scour the Woods round for six or seven miles: as I am informed they never proceeded more than three or four miles upon any of their Scouts, heretofore.

G:W.
