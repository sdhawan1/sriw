The Major Generals are to order the Militia Companies to be joined to the different Brigades and Regimints, in their respective Divisions in such a manner, as to supply the dificiency of the Connecticut Troops, and to prevent disorder and confusion, in case we should be called to action; and make a report thereof as soon as it is done. As the Companies have an Inclination to join particular Regiments, the General has no objection to it, in every Instance where it can be done, consistant with the good of the service, and the allotment to the different encampments. The Adjutants of every regiment to which any of these Companies are joined, are to acquaint them with all General, and Brigade Orders, that they may not unknowingly disobey them.
