To Captains Cocke6 and Ashby:7 of the two Companies of Rangers.
[Winchester, 10 October 1755]



I received an Express as I was going to Williamsburgh, informing me of the Ravages committed by the Indians on the Back Inhabitants: upon which I rode post to this place, after ordering the Recruits from Fredericksburgh, Alexandria, &c. to Repair here, where I expect them every moment.8 So that I doubt not you will be encouraged by this to make a Stand, in case you are attacked or Besieged; as I hope very quickly to Relieve you, and make the Savages and French (who are no better) pay for their Presumption.
I have hired the Bearer to go to you in order to receive a particular account of your Situation, wants, &c. and I must desire you will be very explicit in reciting the Number, and Design of the Enemy.9
If their numbers are not large, from many concurring accounts, you ought to send out Parties to stop their progress, which the Timidity of the Inhabitants has been the cause of.
If it should so happen, that you are obliged to quit your Fort for want of Provisions, &c.
You are hereby positively ordered, to Retreat no farther than Joseph Edwards in Cacapehon:10 where you will be joined by other Parties as fast as they can be collectedI shall only add, that I wish you Success, and expect to hear you have; and will Behave consistently with your Character, as Relief is so near at hand. I am &c.

G:W.
Winchester October 10th 1755.
