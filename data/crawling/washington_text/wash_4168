Sir
Cambridge 15th Novemr 1775



I received your favor of the 6th inst. in which you give a detail of Dr Chineys case as it appeared before you and Council, in which nothing but the fair side of his character appears.
You may be assured Sir that his tryal will be impartial, that no insidious designs of his inemies will have weight, and that it will give me much plasure to find he can acquit himself of the crimes he is charged withThe evidences are hourly expected. On their arrival the tryal will be no longer delayed.1
General Sullivan set out the 12th inst. for Portsmouth New HampshireI enclose you a copy of instructions given unto him.2
As it is now apparent we have nothing to depend on in the present Contest, but our own Strength, Care, Firmness and Union, should not the same measures be adopted in yours and every other Government on the Continent? Would it not be prudence to seize on those Tories who have been, are, and that are known will be, active against us? Why should persons who are preying upon the vitals of their Country be suffered to stalk at large, whilst we know they will do us every mischief in their power? These Sir are points I beg to submit to your serious consideration.
[380]
I congratulate you on the Surrender of St Johns, which hope will soon be followed by the reduction of Canada. I have the honor to be Sir Your most humble Servant

Go. Washington
