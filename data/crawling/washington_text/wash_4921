Requests GWs directions regarding Benjamin Gale, who, by General Lees order, was taken up as a Tory and has been confined to my Goal, till within a Day or two, when I recd the inclosed resolution of N.

You will observe that the resolve of Congress is directed to the Chairman of our Committee, who think they have nothing to do with it, and will not act upon it.1
