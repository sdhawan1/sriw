My Dear Colo.
Staunton March 19th 1762



I did myself the pleasure to write you from Doctor Walkers, I have since from Fort Lewis acknowledgd the rect of your extreme Friendly and affecte Letter of the 31st December.1
A number of our Officers are by Orders assembled here to Settle some Regimental Affairs, which we have just finishd, and now the Virginia Regt exists no longer, I wish they have not been premature in Disbanding a Corps which might have been very Serviceable in prosecuting a war that does not yet seem to draw to a conclusion2I set out to morrow or next Day for the hot Springs in this County in hopes that the efficacy of their Waters will effectually readicate my Rheumatism & reestablish my Health3 I propose to stay three or four weeks at the Springs & will then proceed to Winchester on my way to Mount Vernon and as I can by no means think of leaving this Country without enjoyg the happiness of your Compy for a few Days I would be much obligd by your sending me a Line to the next Winchester
[121]
Court, informing me whether it is most probable I should find you at Home or at Williamsburgh about the latter end of April.4
We have just receivd accots from Phila. that Sir Jeffry Amherst has made a requisition of a considerable Body of Troops (or rather Men) from all the different Colonies, if this should be true our Assembly will undoubtedly be calld, and something may occur that will cause a material change in affairs5I would gladly avail myself of any Expedient that could extricate me out of the very mortifying alternative of Joining the Royal Americans as a Sub: or quiting the Serviceshould a Body of Men be raisd I imagine it would be no very difficult matter to get me Introducd into pretty high Rank, for I cannot think that Colo. Byrd will Serve again, Stepn makes sure of a Compy in the Service6 and Colo. Lewis has repeatedly declard that he never will Serve unless a permanent Provision is made for him, under these circumstances the great object of my endeavours must be to prevent Mr Peachys getting Superior Rank which for reasons that will instantly occur to you I could not Submit to7Whatever may cast up Im well assurd that you will have a Friendly Eye towards meThe Speaker who possesses a real regard for you would I conceive be the most certain Channel, for by a proper exertion of his Interest which is very prevailing at the Palace, any reasonable point might be carriedShould you not be at the Assembly yourself may I beg your writing by a certain oppy to him on this Subject.8
There is nothing here new or entertainingI most ardently wish you every thing that make you supremely happy and ever am with the most exalted and unalterable Esteem My Dear Sir Your most Affecte & Most Obliged hble Servt

Robert Stewart


I Beg my most Respectfull and obliging Complimts to Mrs Washington.
