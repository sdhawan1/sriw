Sir
Decr 20th 1769.



It is with great Pleasure I sit down to inform you, that it is now in my Power to contribute my little Mite of Service to one of the gallant Defenders of their Country. Nor shoud I (however cautious it may be necessary to be in general) have hesitated a Moment to have given my hearty Assent, when you first did me the Honor of applying to me on the Subject of appointing Mr Crawford Surveyor of the 200,000 Acres specified,1 had I not been apprehensive, that it might interfere with a prior Engagement I lay under to Mr May.2 While this Doubt subsisted, Col. Washington woud, I am confident, have condemned me, if I had entered upon a new Resolution; but it is now totally removed, & he may depend upon my Concurrence. I am Sr with great Respect, Your very humble Servant

Josiah Johnson
