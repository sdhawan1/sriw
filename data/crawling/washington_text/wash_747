Evening Orders.

If the people of the Town or Country, have any arms, clothes, Blankets, &c. &c. belonging to the Soldiers, which they have bought; they are desired to give them in immediately to the commanding officer: If they are found in their possession after issuing this order; they must expect to be prosecuted to the utmost rigour of the Law; which has laid a penalty
