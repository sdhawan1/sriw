I recd Yrs of the 28th ulto1the Bearer brings you 600 which is all can be got, & hope it will answer for the present. I have no doubt when the Assembly meets they will grant a Supply in such manner to comand Money; the want thereof I know has been a great Loss to the Expedition2I am sorry Yr regimt have behavd so very refractory, tho they have a right to their Pay they shoud have been easy till You returnd. Its strange the Officers shoud have allowd them to desert with their Guns I hope he sent a Party after them; & an Example shoud be made of the Ringleaders; at this distance I cannot conceive the reason, but it appears to me the want of proper Command3Muse wrote me, & I answerd he was welcome to resign & I suppose Majr Stephens succeeds him.4 I sent You Orders to recruit Your regimt with all possible Diligence, that You may be ready to join the other Forces at Willss Creek to execute the Scheme sent Colo. Innis;5 I repeat my Orders now, & am in hopes You will meet with little Difficulty in complying therewith, & that with Expedition as the Season of the Year calls for it; & I am convincd of Yr hearty Inclinations, which I desire You will now exert.
I have & will do all in my Power in prosecuting the Affair in hand; & I hope in a short Time we shall have our Hands better strengthend with Money; & I expect to hear Yr regimt is compleated & will soon march for Willss Creek.
I send You the Warrant with 600 indorsd on it, the other 500 if any Person with You will advance it they will have 6  Ct Interest; which shall be glad if You can procure it.
I cannot end without repeating DispatchWhich will be very agreable to Sr You[r] Friend &ca
