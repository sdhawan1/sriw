Sir

I have just receivd information that the Nautilus Sloop of War is arrivd here from Newport, said to be sent Express from thence for the Asia Phnix & Savage, and that they are intended for New London in order to block up your Squadron in that harbour. I thought it my duty to give you notice of this by Express that you might take your measures accordinglyThe Phnix Savage & Nautilus saild this morningThe Asia still remains in the harbour.1
I should be much obligd to you if you would forward the Cannon & Stores I left a List with you for, as soon as possible,2 and as the Men of War are now out, I should be extremely glad if you would keep a good look out, to see that the Coast is clear before any more of the Continental Troops embark from New London. I am very respectfully Sir Your most obedt Servant
