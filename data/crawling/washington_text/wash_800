Maidstone July 3rd 1756



I recd your favours by Capt. Gist and agreeable thereto Capt. Bell, he, their Ensigns & Men Marches this day for Fort Cumberland1 Capt. Gist could not get ready sooner there now remains here only the Sick and my own Men, who till within these few days have been all well and are now turning Sick when the Duty is become hardest, theres 3 of them Sick 2 Lame and 1 Confind for Mutiny;2 I have sent off Corporal Winterbottom & have sent for the Deserters at Carlyle all which has vastly diminishd my small Number[.]3 Im under a necessity of having three Centrys vizt 1 at the Guard House Door, 1 on the Store & 1 on the rising Ground above the Intrenchment therefore cant mount less than a Corporl and 9 Men So that very few will remain
[236]
to Range with however will make the most of those few and punctually obey your orders I have spoke to severals of the Country Men and endeavourd to procure some of them to go as guides, Ensign Crawford who is well acquainted with them has likewise spoke to them & wrote amongst his Acquaintances and many of them say they would chearfully go were it not for their Harvest which makes it impossible for them to leave home at this Juncture So that we cant expect the least assistance from them, the few I have fit for Duty must be constantly on Guard or CommandThe Inhabitants are alarmd at the Troops Marching from hence and say that if this place should be evacuated they must abandon their Plantations, I assure them that what now Marches will return again and that you will keep Men here as long their Safety requires itThe Enemy may easily pass Governor Sharp4 and come down here, its true there are but few Stores left But I should think myself as much concernd in makg a good Defence if attackd as if the Royal Bank of England were deposited here tho I dont apprehend much Danger at present but should anything happen Im certain youll do me the Justice to remember the triffling Number I have fit for Duty with which I have the Guard House Hospital and Intrenchmts to Defend & perhaps a small Party out at that timeIt gives me great Joy to hear of yr Intention of coming this way for several reasons, Im perswaded that this will appear a place of more Importance than is generally imagind as it & Mendenhals Covers a well Inhabited Country.5 I am with Great respect Sir Your Most Obt hble Servt
