Reading, Pa., 16 February 1776. Recommends Peter Withington who was for many Years a Quarter Master Serjeant in the Regulars & behaved himself much to the Satisfaction of his Officers. He has lived in this Place for 13 Years past & has always Supported a good Character. He was an early Associator & I believe him to be strongly attached to the great American Cause.1
