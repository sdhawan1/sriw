Dear Sir.
Williamsburg 5th Jany 1758



Capt. McKenzie handed me yr Letter, which inclosed sundry Papers relating to yr Dispute with Mr Strother.1 Mr Power, poor Man, is gone from Home to try for the Recovery of his Health, which I fear will never be restored to him; Mr Wythe is also out of Town, so that I cant with any Exactness say when we shall have an Opportunity of giving an Award; however Ill get it done as soon as I can.2 I am very glad to hear of yr Recovery from so dangerous an Illness. If youve any good News twoud be kind to tell it me; The Govr & his Family it is Thought will embark on Saturday next. I wish you many happy Years & am Dr Sir, Yr most obt humble Sert

Ro. C. Nicholas.
