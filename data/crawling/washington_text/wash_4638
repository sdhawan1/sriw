Parker publishes a pleasant reason for his passive conductHe says that it was manifestly my intention and that of the N. England men under my command to bring down destruction on this Town so hated for their loyal principles but that He was determind not to indulge us, so remaind quiet out of spiteThe People here laugh at his nonsense, and begin to despise the menaces which formerly usd to throw em into convulsions2to do em justice The whole shew a wonderfull alacrityand in removing the Cannon Men and Boys of all ages workd with the greatest zeal and pleasureI really believe that the generallity are as well affected as any on the Continentthe Provincial Congress have orderd in fiveteen hundred Minute Mena Number equal to two Battalions are coming from Pensylvania and the Jerseys3Lord Sterlins Regt is already here but not compleatwhen the Major part or a sufficient number arrive We shall begin our worksmy intention is to pull down that part of the Fort on the Town side to prevent its being converted into a Citidal for the Enemyand to erect a Battery on a traverse in the street to prevent their making a lodgment in ita redoubt and battery at the pass of Hell Gate will prevent their Ships and Tenders passing and repassing to and from the SoundWe have fixd on a Spot in Long Island for a retrenchd Camp which I hope will render it impossible for em to get footing on that important Island as this Camp can always be reinforcd it is our intention to make it so capacious as to contain four thoushand Menthe batteries on the pass of Hudsons River will be securd as soon as possible. some of the heavy Cannon from

Smyth is an excellent intelligent active Officer, and I take the liberty [of] recommending him to your protectionCapt. Badlam of the Artillery is likewise a Man of great merit in his way4You must pardon me Dr General, for a liberty I have takenYou know that Sears was to collect our Volunteers in Connecticutbut He thought He coud not succeed unless He had some nominal Office and rankI accordingly most impudently by the virtue of the power deputed by You to me (which power you never deputed) appointed him Adjudant General with rank of Lt Colonel for the expedition it can have no bad consequences, the Man was much tickled, and it added spurs to his feetHe is a creature of much spirit and public virtue and ought to have his back clappdwith respect to the Canada expedition which You indirectly propose to me,5 I have only one answer to makewherever I can be of most service, there I shoud chuse to beI have indeed just at this instant one objection which is I am not without apprehensions that facing the Cold may throw me into a relapse so as not only to render me unfit for service there but evry where elseI am indeed much better, but extremely tender I begin to walkit has been a damnd attacka constant violent fever attending it, I neither eat nor slept for eight daysbut my fever is passd and I begin to eata week I hope will set me upsevral Members of the Congress have indicated a desire I shoud go to Canada, I have explaind to em my apprehensions, but assurd em most honestly of my willingnessbut in fact unless They expedite an Army and some heavy Artillery it will be in vain to trouble their heads about a GeneralColonel Richmore who lately left Montreal tells us that what few Troops are now there will infallibly return home early in AprilHe is gone to the Congress and I hope will give em (as He is capable) the necessary lights6but whatever steps They take be assurd, Dr General, that I am with the greatest readiness prepard to receive and execute yours and their commands; Canada is I confess, if I am only tolerably accoutred a glorious Field which Must flatter the ambition of, Yours Most sincerely
