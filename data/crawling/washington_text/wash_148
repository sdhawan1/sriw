myself thro Fairfax, where I was detaind a Day in getting Horses.3
At Claybourns Ferry4 the 22d I met \the/ erasure express I had sent, as he was returning, who brought a Verbal message in the most expressive terms from Governour Dinwiddie, acquainting \informing/ me that Colo. Hunter was gone to the Northward and that I woud certainly be disappointed in my expectations \of money/;5 of this I acquainted Captn Orme by Letter,6 and proceeded on to Williamsburg where I arrivd the same Day, and met \a/ Mr Belfour \the/ Partner to \of/ Colo. Hunter with near the sum desird, which was compleated the next day;7 time enough \for me/ to reach Chissels Ordinary8 on my return.
