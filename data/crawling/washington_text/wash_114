To the Speaker of the House of Burgesses. Sir,
[Williamsburg, 23 October 1754]



Nothing could have given me, and the Officers under my command, greater satisfaction, than to have received the thanks of the House of Burgesses, in so particular and honourable a manner, for our Behaviour in the late unsuccessful Engagement with the French at the Great-Meadows;1 and we unanimously hope, that our future Conduct in the Service of our Country, may entitle us to a continuance of its approbation. I assure you, Sir, I shall always look upon it as my indispensable duty to endeavour to deserve it.
I was desired, by the Officers of the Virginia Regiment, to offer their grateful thanks for the Honour which has been confered
[220]
upon them; and hope the enclosed will be indulgently received, and answer their, and the intended purpose of, Sir, Your most hble Servant,


Go: WashingtonOctob. 23, 1754.
