I think it my Indispensible duty to acquaint You that the small Arms now in the store unfit for service, Cannot be made fit for service this season by the Armorers in this place & the Neighbouring placesI aplyd to General Thompson for his Armorers, but he was of Oppinion that they would be wanted in CanadaI therefore give you this Early notice, & beg that some Armorers may be Sent as soon as possible to repair the public arms. Great numbers of the troops that Comes from N. York have arms unfit for service and numbers with out any at all. I am your most Humble servt
