To Robt Orme Esqr. Aid de Camp\Wills Creek1/Dear Orme
[Great Crossing of the Youghiogheny, Pa., 30 June 1755]



I came to this Camp on thursday last, with the Rear of Colo. Dunbars Detacht and shoud have continued on with his Front, to day, but was prevented by Rain.2
My Fevers are very moderate, and I hope are near a Crisis; \terminating/ when I shall have nothing to encounter but excessive weakness \, which is excessive;/ and the difficulty of getting to you \arising therefrombut this miss/; which I would not fail in doing ere \before/ you reach Duquisne, for 500; but \however/ I have no doubt \now/ of doing this, as \I am moving on slowly and/ the General has given me his word and \of/ honour, in the most solemn manner \that it shall be effected/.
As the Doctr3 thinks it imprudent for me to use much exercise for 2 or 3 days, it will prevent \retard the rapidity of my movements;/ my4 coming up[;] therefore, I shoud be glad to be advisd of your Marches from Gists, and how you are likely to get on;5 for you may rest assurd, that Colo. Dunbar cannot get \move/ from his present Incampment in less than two or three Days; and I believe really, it will be as much as he possibly can do to reach the Meadows at all; so that you will be greatly advancd before us. \him./6 I am too weak to add more than my Compts to the Genl \the/ Family, &ca & again to desire that you will oblige me in the above request, and advise \devise/ the most effectual means \for me/ to join you. I am Dr Orme Your most Obt Servt

Go: Washington
