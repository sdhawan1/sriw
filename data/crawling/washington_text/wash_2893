Dear Sir

Altho I can hardly hold a Pen, yett this is to acknowl. the Receipt of yours,1 with a Letter for your Brother, and Colo: R: H: Lee in Westmoreland, which I hope they will Rece. this Week, as I am determined as soon as this very inclement touch of Weather is over (for I think I never felt any more severe) and I
[184]
can pass the River to sett off, and heartily wish you and Company good sport a Hunting, and hope youl come into this Neck then, and at all times without Ceremony.2
I hope the Pistols I have will do, if not will take the liberty of sending for yours. What you have done respecting the bound. of the Seventy two Acres of Land, is very satisfactory.3
Our Complements, and best wishes, attend you, Lady, and Miss Custis, and am Dear sir Your Most Obedt humble Servt

I felt another touch of the Gout last Night, but hope its only the Effect of the Weather.
