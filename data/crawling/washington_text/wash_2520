This serves to advise the arrival of the Hanbury Capt. James Esten, after a favorable passage of about 5 Weeks,1 by him we observe we are favord with 8 Hhds Tobacco from our friend J.P. Custis, in the Sale of which our best endeavors shall be exerted for his InterestThe Ship came up to her Moorings yesterday, and we are preparing to Land her Cargo the begining of the next WeekThe prices of Tobacco are much the same as for some time past, that is from 3 to 4d.  lb., if any alteration it is rather for the worse, but we hope to keep it up and to be able to render agreable Sales.
It gives us concern to have to mention the Death of our C. H.,2 As the business will be continued as usual, We shall be glad of a continuance of thy friendship, and Correspondence and remain with great regard Thy assured Friends

Capel & Osgood Hanbury
