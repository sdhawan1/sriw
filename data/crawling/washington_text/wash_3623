Sir
Camp at Cambridge August 9th 1775



From some late Intelligence out of Boston & sundry corroborating Circumstances, there is great Reason to suspect, that the Ministerial Troop intend either to make a Diversion to the Southward, or wholly to removeIf they should do either, it is most probable New York is the Place of their Destination; I therefore think it most Adviseable, that the Troop of your Colony who have not yet marchd, or may easely be recalled, should wait further OrdersYou will therefore Sir be pleased
[281]
to give the necessary Directions for this Purpose As soon as possible.1
No Occurrence in the Camp of any Consequence since I had the Pleasure of addressing you last. I am with due Regard Your most Obedt humble Servant

Go. Washington
