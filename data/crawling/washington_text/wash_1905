mutilatedth, the tedious Affair of Mr Cliftons has come to some mutilated at least as depends upon the Commissioners; and mutilated of them as will discharge the Debts due thereon mutilateditors are Advertisd for Sale at Fairfax May mutilated I understand Mr Mason right, he intends mutilated Sale, or in other Words (which If I mutilated to buy the Land let it be run up to neverso great a price and pay only 1200 Sterlg for ita Sum Mr Clifton consented to take of him for the Land abt 24 hours (it coud scarcely be more) after he had sold it to me in the most Solemn manner for 1150. If Mr Mason confirmd his bargain by any sufficient Instrument of writing twas more than I did, because I was told by one of the Commissioners but not, till after I had settled almost every preliminary necessary to a

Conclusn with Mr Cliftonthat he (Mr Clifton) had not the least Shadow of pretence to dispose of the Land otherwise than the Decree of the Genl Court had expressly directed and that any such private bargain coud not be effectual I therefore contented myself with exacting Mr Cliftons promise of conveying me the Land if it shoud be thought he consistantly coud do it for it is to be observd here that I never had at this time seen the Decretal Order for Selling the Land myself, consequently coud only Judge of it from report and from whom coud I better have it than a Gentleman who had been acting by it?

I coud relate many particulars that were Settled by Mr Clifton mutilated to this purchase but it woud shew the mutilated Shifts he was reduced to for Excuses without answer mutilated firmly and Circumstantially we had bargaind mutilated avoid the mentn of themWhat I have hemutilated Impartial State of the Case and I mutilated to the Honble Court, that they may either mutilated go according to the Advmutilated after being thus thoroughly informd of the matter.1
Mr Mason probably may say, he will advance as much money as will disengage the Land, and therefore tis nothing to the Creditors whether it be sold at Publick or private Sale. He is not singular in this, I will do the same. Perhaps he may then urge (for I dont know what writings have passd) that Mr Clifton is under penal Engagements to him: as to this, I dont think Mr Clifton was authorisd to enter into any Legal engagemtsand if equitable ones are regarded mine being prior puts me at least upon a par with himHowever as it appears clear, that Mr Clifton sold his Land twice, and I believe as clear that he had no right to sell it at alland as there are several persons

that Incline to purchase the Question seems whether it wont be the most equitable footing it can be put upon to confirm the Opinion of the Commissioners for Selling it at Publick Auctiontwill2 they will certainly be an advantage to Mr Clifton, no prejudice to the Creditors and giving all Bidders an equal chance of Purchasing.
