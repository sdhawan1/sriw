The Comtee of Correspondence & Safety in this place, to whose Consideration Your Excellency, by letter dated the 27th of Novr last was pleased to refer the affair of one Denny, and his capturd Vessel & Cargo; having on the first of December transmitted to You, Their Proceedings relative thereto;1 beg leave now to report furtherthat (having notified all Persons concernd) after a full hearing & careful Examination & Enquiry
[55]
of the several Evidences before us, (consisting of People on Board said Vessel when Taken, and of the neighbours supposd best acquainted with the Character of Sd Denny and one Buddington who, for some Reasons weare suspected of being toryistical) cannot Find that Either of them have adopted or pursued any measure really inimical to America, or in any thing acted a Part so obnoxious, but that, they, upon paying the necessary and Occasional Charges might without further Delay or Trouble have said Vessel & Cargo Restord to themunless the mere Act of Sd Dennys availing himself, & being Possessd of the inclosed Certificate & Clearance, when taken, should be deemd a Sufficient Bar in the Way; relative to which, the Bearer is desird to wait and Receive Your Excellencys Resolution & Commands2from Your Most obedient humble servant

By order of the Committee
