You are hereby positively ordered, to collect as many Waggons in this Town by the 30th Instant, as will carry up all the Salt which is in Store here; and Provisions for one hundred and fifty men, who will march from this place at that time. If the Inhabitants who have Waggons, &c. refuse to send them in; you are to apply to the Commanding Officer here, who will order you a party of Soldiers to bring them in by Force.

You are to purchase all the Forage you can for the Publick; and have it delivered here for you, as soon as possible; at which time you may engage to pay them the money for what they deliver. &c.
