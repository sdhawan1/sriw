To The Honble Wm Fairfax Esqr.\Belvoir1/Dear Sir
[Winchester, 5 May 1755]



I overtook the General at Frederick Town in Maryld and from thence we proceeded to this place,2 where we shall remain till the arrival of the 2d Division of the Train, (which we hear left Alexandria on Tuesday last);3 after that, we shall continue our March to Wills Creek, from whence it is imagined we shall not stir till the latter end of this Month for want of Waggons, and other conveniences to Transports our Baggage &ca over the Mountn.4
You will naturally conclude \that/ to pass through Maryld (when no business \object/ requird it) was an uncommon, & extraordinary rout for the Genl, and Colo. Dunbarrs Regiment5 to this place; but at the same time t \T/he reason, however, was obvious6 to say, that t \T/hose who promoted it had rather have \that/ the communication
[263]
\should be opened/ that way, than through Virginia; but I now believe \the eyes of the General are now open, &/ the Imposition has too evidently appeard, for the Imposers to subject us to the same Inconveniences again \detectedconsequently the like will not happen again/.7 Please to make my Compts to Colo. G:8 to whom I shall write by the next oppertunity, and excuse hasteI am Sir Yr most Obedt Servt

Go: Washington
