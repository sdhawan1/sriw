Honble Sir
Winchester Octr 17th 1755



Last night by return of the express who went to Captn Montour I receivd the Inclosd from Mr Harris at Susquehanna1I think no means shd be neglected to preserve what few Indians still remain in our Interest, for wch Reason I shall send Mr Gist so soon as he arrives (which I expect will be today) to Harriss Ferry2 in hopes of engageing, and bringing with him the Belt of Wampum, and other Indians that are at that place; and I shall further desire him to send an Indian Express to Andw Montour to try if he can be brought along with them.3
In however trifling light, the French attempting to alienate the affections of our Southern Indians may at first appear, I must look upon it as a thing of the utmost consequence, that requires our greatest and most immediate attentionI have often wonderd at not hearing that this was attempted before, and had it noted among other Memdms to acquaint your honour off when I shoud come down. The French policy in treating with Indians is so prevalent, that I shoud not be in the least surprisd, were they to engage the Cherokees, Cuttabas &ca, unless timely and vigorous measures is taken to prevent itA Pusilanimous behaviour now woud ill suit the times, and trusting to Traders & Common Interpreters (who will sell their Integrity to the highest bidder) may prove the destruction of these Affairs: I therefore think that if a Person of distinction, acquainted with their language is to be found, his Price shd be come to at any rate; if no such can be had, a Man of Sense and Character to conduct the Indians to any Council that may be held, or to Superintend any other matters, will be found extreamely necessaryIt is impertinent I own in me to offer my opinion in these matters, when better Judges may direct, but my steady, and hearty Zeal to the cause, and the great impositions I have known practisd by the Traders &ca upon these occasions wd not suffer me to be quite Silent: I have heard from undoubteded Authority that some of the Cherokees that have been Introduced to us as Sachims and Princes by the Interpreters4 (Who share their presents and profits) have been no other than common hunters, and blood thirsty VillainsWe have no

accts yet of the Militia from Fairfax &ca. This day I march with abt 100 Men to Fort Cumberland, Yesterday by an express I was informd of the arrival of 80 odd Recruits to Fredg whh I have orderd to proceed to this place,5 but for want of that regularity being observd by wch I shd know where every Officer &ca ought to bemy orders are only conditl & always confusd. Whatever necessarys your honour gets below, I shd be glad to have them sent to Alexandria, from where they come much more handy than from Fredgbesides, as Provisions are lodgd there and none at the other place it will be best for the Men to be all sent there that is any ways convt for we have met with insuperable6 difficultys at Fredg & in our March from thence by the Neglect of the Com[missar]y who is at this time greatly wanted here therefore I hope yr honr will order him up immey if not things will suffer very much.7 I am Honble Sir Yr most Obt Servt
