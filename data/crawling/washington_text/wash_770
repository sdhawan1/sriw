Dear Sir
Dogues Neck June 12th 1756



I take the Liberty to address You on Behalf of my Neighbour & Your old School-fellow, Mr Piper;1 who, without duly considering the Consequences, when he was at Winchester enlisted as a Sarjeant in Capt. Mercers Company; he has been down to consult his Father upon it, & finds him excessively averse to it, & as his principal Dependance is upon the old Man (besides the Duty naturally due to a parent) his disobligeing him in an Affair of this Nature cannot but be highly detrimental to HimI need not then say that it woud be an Act of Humanity in Colo. Washington to discharge him. Mr piper tells Me that he has never Yet been attested, which seems so essential a part of the Enlisting that I conceive he coud not be legally detaind against his Will, but has still a Right to depart upon returning whatever
[203]
Money he may have receivedthis I only hint, & submit it to Your better JudgementBe that as it will, Mr Piper woud much rather chuse to receive his Discharge from You as a Favour than insist upon it as a Matter of RightIt woud be superfluous to add that Your good Offices to Mr Piper on this Occasion will ever be esteemd the greatest Obligation on Dr Sir Yr most obdt Servt
