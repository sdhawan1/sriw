Stephen,1 with which I should have waited on You, had I not have heard You were gone to Williamsburg; I am now a recruiting much discouragd by the Gentlemens Success, who have lately been, but no Pains shall be wanting on my Side to compleat my Company, but I fear it will be without Effect, Colo. Stephens Orders to repair to Winchester by the first of March I presume, is too short a Time to do much Business in, wherefore should be glad You would increase the Time either to the first of April, or alow us as many
