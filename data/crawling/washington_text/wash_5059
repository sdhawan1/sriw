Williamsburg May the 10th 1776



The most compendious method to give you an idea of the state of your Province is to inclose to you the result of a Council of Officers every article of which is approvd by your Convention1We have just receivd an express from N. Carolina informing us of the arrival of eight large Transports in Cape Fear River on the whole containing as it is supposd, about two thousand MenI had before, on a suspicion of their arrival detachd a Battalion of Rifle Men, and shall set out myself the day after tomorrowthe Convention has orderd twelve hundred Militia or Minute Men to that Province2My command (as you may easily conceive) is extremely perplexing from the consideration of the vast extent of vulnerable parts of this Country intersected by such a variety of navigable waters, and the expedition with which the Enemy (furnishd with canvass Wings) can fly from one spot to anotherhad We arms for the Minute Men and half a dozen good field EngineersWe might laugh at their effortsbut in this article (like the rest of the Continent) We are miserably deficientEngineers We have but twoand They threaten to resign as it is impossible that They shoud subsist on a more wretched pittance than Common Carpenters or Brickl[ay]ers can earnI have written to the Congress intreating em to augment the pay3a word from you, woud, I make no doubt, effect itI wish, My Dr General, You woud send me Capt. Smith on condition the Congress make it worth his while, otherwise I have not the conscience to propose

it4I am well pleasd with your Officers in general, and the Men are good, some Irish Rascals exceptedI have formd two Companies of Grenadiers to each Regt armd with spears of thirteen feet longtheir Rifles (for they are all Rifle Men) slung over their Shoulderstheir appearance is formidable and the Men are conciliated to the weaponI am likewise furnishing myself with four ouncd Rifled Amusets which will carry an infernal distancethe two ouncd hit a half sheet of Paper at five hundred yards distance5so much for militarya noble spirit possesses the ConventionThey are almost unanimous for independence but differ in their sentiments about the modetwo days will decide it6I have the pleasure to inform you that I am extremely well in the opinion of the senatorial part as well as of the People at largeGod send me the grace to preserve itbut their Neighbours of Maryland (I mean their council of safety) make a most damnable clamour (as I am informd) on the subject of a letter I wrote to the Chairman of the Committee of Baltimore to seize the person and papers of Mr Eden upon the discovery which was communicated to me of his treacherous correspondence with the Secretary of Stateit was a measure not only justifiable in the eyes of Gods and Men, but absolutely necessarythe Committee of safety here are indeed as deep in the scrape as myselfthe Congress must, and will, I dare say support and vindicate the measure7 Capt. Greer and his party are upon their March as you orderd, I was a damnd Blockhead for bringing em so faras their accounts will be intricatebut I hope not so intricate as not to be unriddledI send you an account of the Money I advancd to the different Officersto Capts. Smith Lunt and Greer8I have taken the liberty to appoint a Serjt Denmark, of the Rifle Battalion to do duty as EnsignHe is a Man of worth and I beg you will confirm his commissionanother Serjt of the same Battalion I have promoted to the rank of second Lt in the Artillery of this ProvinceHe is a Germanhis name Holmer and very deservingif little Eustace cannot be provided for with youI coud wish if there is a cheap method of doing it, You woud send him to meas I have it in my power to place him and quite doat upon him9my love to Mrs Washington Gates and her bad halfto
