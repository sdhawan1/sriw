Fairfaxs1 When he went away he gave me the Trunk & Papers and told me Mr Dalton Mr Piper & myself were to Settle them and that I would use them when Calld upon for that Purpose.2 When I came home I informd Mr Dalton I was Possessd of these Papers for the Purpose and that I should attend when they pleasd but I never was Calld on. Mr Dalton Yesterday askd me when I could spare an hour for that Purpose I told him I was Ready any Moment and allways had been from the time I had Mentioned to him that I was Possessd of the Papers But I did not aprehend it became me to insist on a Settlement I shall endeavour if it Sutes Mr Pipers Convenience, to do something in them tomorrow but if they are so intricate as Mr Fairfax seems to Suggest they will Certainly take more time What I can do I am very willing to do for Mr Fairfax and wish it may give Sattisfaction but I sincerly wish he had settled them himself3 I am with Respect Sir your most Obt hle Servt
