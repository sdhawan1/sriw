Please to send me at the time that Mr Cary forwards my Goods, a suit of Cloaths made of superfine broad Cloth, and as
[267]
light as possible for Summer wearI have seen them made of light coloured mixed Cloths without linings, bound holes &ca which are handsome enoughone of these kind you may send, or of any other sort that is more in taste as the fashions are often changingAlso send me another suit of (riding) Cloathsfit for Winter wear.
As I sent the best directions I coud think of for making my Cloaths (which were wrote for in April last) it will be unnecessary to add any thing further I conceive on that head for I hope these Cloaths will fit me very well when they come to hand1I am Sir Yr Hble Servt
