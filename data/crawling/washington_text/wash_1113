Sir
Fort Loudoun June 16th 1757



This Moment the inclosd Letters came to My hands:1 I have not lost a moments time in Transmitting them to youas I look upon the Intelligence to be of the utmost Importance. If the Enemy is coming down in Such Numbers, and with such a train of Artillery as we are bid to Expect Fort Cumberland Must inivitably fall in to their hands as no Efforts can be timely Made to save it.
I Send you Sir a Copy of a Council of War held at This place; and I intend to pursue the resolutions theirin co[n]taind, till I receive orders how to Act. It is Morally certain that the next Object Which the French have in view is Fort Loudounand that it is yet in a very untenable Posture; they have no roads for carriages in to any other Province but thr this place, and their lyes hear a quantity of Stores Belonging to his Majesty & this Colony very much exposd and unguarded.
I shall not taken up your time Sir With Sending a tedious detail
