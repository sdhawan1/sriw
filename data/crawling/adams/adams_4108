<p>The States of Holland and West-friesland have determined the last week upon our project of a treaty of Commerce, and I expect to enter into a conference with the States General this week, in order to bring it to a conclusion. I hope for the Ratification of the Contract for a loan, wh. has been sent five different ways. Upon rect. of this ratification, there will be thirteen or fourteen hundred thousand Guildres ready to be paid to the orders of Congress by Messrs: Wilhem &amp; Jen Willink, Nicholas &amp; Jacob Van Staphorst, and de la Lande &amp; Fynj.</p>
<p>The States and the Regencies, are taking such measures with the Stadtholder, by demanding his orders and Correspondences abt: Naval Affairs, and by reassuming their own Constitutional Rights, in the appointment of Officers &amp;c. as will bring all things to rights in this Republic, which we shall find an affectionate and an usefull friend.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA13d180n5" id="PJA13d180n5-ptr">5</a></p>
<p>The Communication of the following Instructions to me is such a piece of friendship, and such a mark of Confidence, as makes it my duty to request of Congress that it may be kept secrett.</p>
<div class="quoteFT">
<div class="floatingText">
<p>Instructions projected and passed for Mr: the Ambassador Lesteven de Berkenrode and Mr: de Brantzen.</p>
<p>1st. His most Christian Majesty, having manifested, in the most obliging, manner, by his Ambassador Extraory:, Mr: le duc de la Vauguion, who resides here, his favorable intention, to have an eye to the Interests of the Republic, in the negotiations for a general peace; the aforesd. Ministers, will neglect nothing, but on the contrary will employ all their diligence and all their Zeal to preserve and fortify, more and more, this favorable disposition of his Majesty, towards this State.</p>
<p>2dly. To this end, these Gentlemen, in all wh. concerns the objects of their Commission, or wh. may have any relation to them, will act in a communicative manner, and in concert with the ministry of his sd. majesty, and will make confidential Communications of all things with them.</p>
<p>3dly. They will not enter into any negotiation of Peace, between the British Court and the Republic, nor have any Conferences thereupon, with the ministers of sd. Court, before they are assured, beforehand, in the clearest manner and without any equivocation, that his British Majesty, has in fact and continues to have, a real intention to acquiesce without reserve, that the Republic be in full possession and indisputable enjoyment, of the Rights of the Neutral Flagg, and of a free Navigation, in conformity and accordg. to the <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="ADMS-06-13-02-pb-0247">[247]</span>tenor of the points enumerated in the declaration of Her Imperial Majesty of Russia, dated the 28th of February, 1780.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA13d180n6" id="PJA13d180n6-ptr">6</a></p>
<p>4thly. When these Gentlemen shall be certain of this, and shall have recd. the requisite assurances of it, they shall conduct in such a manner in the Conferences wh. shall be then held thereupon with the Ministers of his British Majesty, as to direct things to such an end that in projecting the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between his sd. Majesty and the Republic, all the points concerng. the free navigation be adopted word for word, and literally, from the sd: declaration of her Imperial Majesty and inserted in the sd. Treaty; And moreover in regard to Contraband, (upon the subject of which the sd. declaration refers to the Treaties of Commerce, then subsisting between the respective Powers.) that they establish henceforward a limitation so precise and so distinct, that it may appear, most clearly in future, that all naval stores (les munitions ou mattiers navales) be held free merchandizes, and may not, by any means, be comprehended under the denomination of Contraband. As also, that with regard to the visitation of Merchant Vessells, they establish the two followg. rules as perpetual and immutableViz, 1st. That the Masters (Patrons) of Merchant Ships shall be discharged upon exhibiting their Documents, from whence their Cargoes may be known, and to wh. faith ought to be given, without pretending to molest them by any visitation. 2dly. That when merchant Ships shall be convoyed by vessells of War, all faith shall be yielded to the Commanding Officers, who shall escort the Convoy, when they shall declare and affirm upon their word of honor, the nature of their Cargoes; without being able to require of vessells convoyed, any exhibition of Papers, and still less to visit them.</p>
<p>5thly. These Gentlemen shall insist also, in the strongest manner, and, as upon a condition, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">sine qua non</span>, upon this, that all the possessions conquered fm. the Republic, by the Ships of War or Privateers of his British Majesty, or by the arms of the English East-India Company, during the Course of this war; or which may be further conquered fm. it, before the conclusion of the Peace, be restored to it, under the eventual obligation of Reciprocity; and this, as far as possible, in the same state in wh: they were at the time of the Invasion. And, whereas the greatest part of these possessions have been retaken fm. the common enemy, by the arms of his Most Christian Majesty, these Gentlemen will insist, in the strongest manner with his Majesty and his Ministry, that, by the promise of the restitution of these possessions to the state, immediately after the conclusion <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="ADMS-06-13-02-pb-0248">[248]</span>of the Peace, the Republic may receive real proofs of the benevolence and of the affection, wh. his Majesty has so often testified for it.</p>
<p>6thly. These Gentlemen will insist also, in the strongest manner, upon the just indemmnification for all the Losses, unjustly caused, by G. Britain, to the State and to its Inhabitants, both in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
<p>7thly. In the affairs concerng. the interests of the Company of the East Indies of this Country, these Gentlemen ought to demand and receive the Considerations of the Commissaries, who are now at Paris, on the part of the Company, and act in Concert with them, in relation to these affairs.</p>
<p>8thly. In all respects, these Gentlemen will hold a good Correspondence with the Ministers of the other belligerent Powers; and it is very specially enjoyned upon them, and recommended, to direct things to this, that in the sd. Negotiations, there be given no room to be able to conclude or resolve either Treaty or cessation of Hostilities, if it be not with the common and simultaneous Concurrence of all Belligerent Powers.</p>
<p>9thly. Finally, and in general, these Gentlemen during the course of all this Negotiation, will have always before their eyes that the Conferences, at Paris, at least for the present, ought not to be looked upon, but as preparatory and preliminary; and that the decision of points wh. may remain in litigation, ought to be reserved to a general Congress, together with the adjustment final, of the definitive Treaty of Peace: The whole, at least, untill their High Mightinesses further informed of the success of these Negotiations, and <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[of]</span> the inclination of the belligerent Powers, shall find good to qualify these Gentlemen for the final and peremptory conclusion of a Treaty.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These Instructions will shew Congress in a clear light, the disposition of this Republic, to be as favorable for Us and our Allies, as <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[we]</span> could wish it.</p>

 <p>Know then, that we, greatly confiding in the fidelity, industry, knowledge understanding and abilities of our faithful and well beloved Allen Fitz Herbert, Esquire, We have nominated, appointed and constituted him, and we do by these presents nominate appoint and constitute him our true, certain and undoubted Commissary, Attorney and Plenipotentiary, giving and granting to him all and every sort of power, faculty and authority, as well as our general and special Mandate (in such a manner however, that the one may not derogate to the other) to repair to the Court of our aforesaid good brother the most Christian King, and there for us and in our name, with the Delegates, Commissaries, Deputies and Plenipotentiaries of the High and mighty Lords the states general of the United Netherlands, and with those of all Princes and states whom it may concern, having sufficient authority to meet and confer, as well jointly as separately and with them to agree, treat, consult and conclude, of the most speedy restoration of a firm and sincere peace, friendship and amity, to sign in our name all that he shall thus agree to and conclude, and to digest what he shall have concluded into a Treaty or Treaties, or any other Instruments, and as many such as shall be necessary, to receive and deliver the same, and to transact every other necessary matter to bring his business to a happy conclusion in the same form to be of the same validity as if it was transacted by ourselves in person, promising freely and on the word of a King to agree to, ratify and accept whatever shall be transacted and concluded by our said Plenipotentiary, and not to suffer at any time that it be violated entirely or in part, or that any thing may be done to the contrary.</p>
 <p>In faith whereof we have signed these presents with our Royal hand, and affixed thereto our seal of Great Britain. Given at our Palace at St. James the 24th day of July Anno Domini 1782 and in the 22d Year of our Reign.</p>

   <p>The Latin phrase reads, with those of all states whom it may concern. <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> was troubled because Fitzherbert lacked a commission to negotiate specifically a peace treaty with the United States. Instead he held commissions to negotiate with France, Spain, and the Netherlands, with the United States being included only under the terms of the passage cited by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>. This was unacceptable because neither the British nation nor George III recognized the United States as independent and sovereign. Therefore, it was unwise to accept a mere verbal assurance that a commission that did not name the United States specifically as a party to the negotiations nevertheless included the United States among those states concerned in the negotiations and with whom Fitzherbert was empowered to negotiate. A treaty could be negotiated only between sovereign states, and in the absence of recognition, Britain was free to disavow any agreement that Fitzherbert might make with its colonies. This issue was not resolved until Richard Oswald received his commission of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-13-02-0209" class="document">21 Sept.</a>, below, authorizing him to negotiate with the United States.</p>

   <p>In the Letterbook, the two paragraphs that followed were canceled. They read, <div class="quoteFT">
<div class="floatingText">
 <p>For my own Part I will be very explicit with Congress. If I were now the Sole Minister for treating of Peace, I should decidedly refuse to enter into any Conferences with any one whatever, without full and express Powers to treat with the United States of America. If I had been alone when the first Messengers were sent over, I mean when Mr Diggs, and Mr oswald came over, my Answer would have <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="ADMS-06-13-02-pb-0250">[250]</span>been clear, that I never would treat but with such a Plenipotentiary. If my Opinion had been asked by Dr Franklin I should have given him the same. If this only wise and manly Part had been taken We should have had Such a Minister, long eer now to have treated with and Mr Foxs System would have prevailed. But instead of this Dr Franklin Sends over to England Mr Alexander and he tells them that no such Acknowledgement of our Independence would be insisted on. Thus it is that all American affairs are conducted by Dr Franklin. I have not refused to act in the Commission with him because I thought it possible that I might perhaps do some little good in it, or prevent some Evil. But I despair, of doing much, to such a Degree, that I beg Congress would release me from this Tye and appoint another Minister of that Commission in my Room.</p>
 <p>At least this is my humble opinion. If We ever gain any Advantage from modern Britons, by relaxing in one Iota from our Principles and just Pretentions, I am wholly mistaken in their Character.</p>
