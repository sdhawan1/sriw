      <p class="salute">Gentlemen.</p>
     </div>
     <p>You have, once more received, the highest Testimony of the Confidence and Affection of your Constituents, which the Constitution has impowered them to exhibit; the Trust of representing them in the great and general Court or Assembly of this Province. This important Trust is committed to you, at a time when your Country demands the Exertion of all your Wisdom Fortitude and Virtue; and therefore it is presumed, a free Communication of our Sentiments, cannot but be agreable to you.</p>
     <p>1 The first object of your Attention, is the Priviledges of that Assembly of which you are now chosen to be Members. The Debates there must be free: You will therefore exert yourselves to remove every Thing that may carry the least Appearance of an Attempt, to awe or intimidate. As the Assembly is called to Sett in the usual Place, common Decency, as well as the Honour, and Dignity of a free legislative will require a Removal of those Cannon, and Guards, as well as that clamorous Parade which has been daily around the Court House, Since the Arrival of his Majestys Troops, and even at Sometimes while the highest Court of Judicature has been Sitting there on the Tryal of capital Causes.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n1" id="PJA01d108n1-ptr">1</a></p>
     <p>2 When this Grievance shall be removed, and the Debates of the Assembly shall be free, it will be natural to enquire into all the Grievances we have Suffered from the military Power: Why they have been quartered in the Body of this Town, in Contradiction to the express Words, and as we conceive the manifest Intention of an Act of Parliament: Why the officers who have thus violated our Rights, have not been called to account, and dealt with as the Law required: Whether the Measure taken by the Governor, in appointing an extraordinary officer to provide Quarters for the Troops, was not an Evasion of the Act of Parliament made for the billetting and quartering his Majestys Troops in America (the professed Rule of their Conduct) and designed to elude the Clause of said Act purposely providing for, the <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-01-02-pb-0225">[225<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-01/ADMS-06-01-02-pb-0225.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>Convenience of American Subjects, And their Security against an Excess of military Power:<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n2" id="PJA01d108n2-ptr">2</a></p>
     <p>3d. Why the repeated Offences and Violences committed by the Soldiery against the Peace and in open Defiance and Contempt of the civil Magistrate And the Law, have escaped Punishment in the Courts of Justice:</p>
     <p>4th. And whether the Attorney General has not, in Some late Instances unduly <del title="deleted text">&lt;assumed, and exerted&gt;</del> exercised a Power of entering <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Nolle prosequi,</span> upon Indictments, without the Concurrence of the Court, in Obstruction to the Course of Justice and to the great Encouragement of Violence and Oppression.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n3" id="PJA01d108n3-ptr">3</a></p>
     <p>5 And as the Quartering Troops <del title="deleted text">&lt;appears to be the grand Source of all these Evils,&gt;</del> here has provd occasion of many evils we do earnestly recommend to you, to use your utmost Endeavours for a Speedy Removal of them <del title="deleted text">&lt;, to Places where they may be really usefull and necessary.&gt;</del></p>
     <p>6 Should<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n4" id="PJA01d108n4-ptr">4</a> The Expence that has been incurred <del title="deleted text">&lt;in the Transportation of these Troops hither,&gt;</del> in providing Barracks for the troops and supplying them with Necessaries, <del title="deleted text">&lt;has in our opinion been purposely great. A Reimbursement may possibly&gt;</del> be required of the House of Representatives. <del title="deleted text">&lt;Should this be the Case,&gt;</del> We do, in the most solemn and express manner, enjoin <del title="deleted text">&lt;you, upon no Consideration whatever to pay the least Regard to so unreasonable&gt;</del> that you by no means comply with such<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n5" id="PJA01d108n5-ptr">5</a> a Requisition. If the general Court is a free assembly, no Power upon Earth has authority to compell it to pay this Money: <del title="deleted text">&lt;if it is not free,&gt;</del> Should it ever be deprived of its Freedom<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n6" id="PJA01d108n6-ptr">6</a> it shall never <del title="deleted text">&lt;with our Consent&gt;</del> be made an Engine <del title="deleted text">&lt;to raise this Money from us.&gt;</del> to drain us of <del title="deleted text">&lt;our Treasure&gt;</del> the little Money we have left.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n7" id="PJA01d108n7-ptr">7</a></p>

     </p>
     <p>8 It is unnecessary for Us at this Time, to repeat our well known<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n17" id="PJA01d108n17-ptr">17</a> Sentiments concerning the Revenue, which is continually, <del title="deleted text">&lt;collecting from&gt;</del> levyd upon<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n18" id="PJA01d108n18-ptr">18</a> Us, to our great Distress and for No other End than to support a great Number of<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n19" id="PJA01d108n19-ptr">19</a> very unnecessary Placemen and Pensioners. We have now only to add, that our Sentiments on this Subject are in no Respect changed, And that We expect you pursue with <del title="deleted text">&lt;unabated Zeal, and unalterable Resolution&gt;</del> firm Resolution and unremitted ardor every Measure that may tend to procure us Relief never yeilding <del title="deleted text">&lt;the least&gt;</del> your<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n20" id="PJA01d108n20-ptr">20</a> Consent to or Connivance, at <del title="deleted text">&lt;any&gt;</del> the least<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n21" id="PJA01d108n21-ptr">21</a> Encroachments on our Rights. Next to the Revenue itself, the late Extensions of the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, are our greatest Grievance. The American Courts of Admiralty Seem to be forming by Degrees, into a System, that is to overturn our Constitution; and to deprive us entirely of our best Inheritance, the Law of the Land. It would be thought in England, a dangerous Innovation if the Tryal of any Matter <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">upon Land</span>, was given to the Admiral. It would be thought more threatning still, if the Power of Confiscation, over Ships and Cargoes for illicit Trade, was committed to that Court: But if the Forfeitures of Ships and Cargoes, large Penalties upon Masters, and such exorbitant Penalties as the Treble Value of Cargoes, upon every <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Person co]</span>ncerned<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n22" id="PJA01d108n22-ptr">22</a> in Landing uncustomed goods, were by Act of Parliament appointed to be tryed by the Admiral, the Nation would think their Liberties irrecoverably lost.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d108n23" id="PJA01d108n23-ptr">23</a></p>
     <p>This, however is the miserable Case of North America! In the 41.ss. of the Statute of the 4th. of G<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[eo]</span>. 3. c. 15. We find that <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">all the Forfeitures and Penalties, inflicted by this, or any other Act of Parliament, relating to the Trade and Revenues of the British Colonies or Plantations in America, which shall be incurred there, may be prosecuted, <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-01-02-pb-0227">[227<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-01/ADMS-06-01-02-pb-0227.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>sued for and recovered in any Court of Admiralty, in the said Colonies</span>. Thus, these extraordinary Penalties and Forfeitures, are to be heard and tryed not by a Jurynot by the Law of the Landbut by the civil Law and a single Judge! Unlike the ancient Barons, who answered with one Voice We will not that the Laws of England be changed, which of old have been used and approved, the Barons of modern Times, seem to have answered, that <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">they</span> are willing, those Laws should be changed, with Regard to America, in the most tender Point, and fundamental Principle!</p>
     <p>9 And this hardship is the more severe as we see in the same Page of the statute, and the section immediately preceding, that all Penalties and Forfeitures, which shall be incurred in Great Britain, shall be prosecuted, sued for, and recovered, in any of his Majestys Courts of Record in Westminster, or in the Court of Exchequer in Scotland respectively. Here is a Contrast that stares Us, in the Face! <del title="deleted text">&lt;an unjust&gt;</del> A partial Distinction that is made between the subject in Great Britain, and the subject in America! The Parliament in one section, guarding the People of the Realm, and securing to them, the Benefit of a Tryal by Jury and the Law of the Land, and by the next section depriving Americans of those important Rights.

     <p>The formidable Power of these Courts, and their distressing Course of Proceedings, have been Severely felt within the past Year, many of your fellow Citizens having been worn out with Attendance upon them, in Defence against Informations for extravagant and enormous Penalties.

     <p>We therefore earnestly recommend to you, by every legal Measure to endeavor that the Power of these Courts may be confined to their proper Element, according to the ancient English Statutes, and that you petition and remonstrate against the late Extensions of their Jurisdiction: And we doubt not, the other Colonies and Provinces, who <del title="deleted text">&lt;begin to&gt;</del> Suffer, with us, under them, will chearfully harmonise with <del title="deleted text">&lt;you&gt;</del> this, in any justifiable Measures that may be taken for Redress.</p>
