<p>Having executed the Treaty of Commerce, at the Hague and dispatched four Copies of it, by four different Vessells bound to America from the Texel, and having Signed a Sufficient Number of Obligations to leave in the Hands of Messrs Willinks, Vanstaphorst and De La Lande and Fynje, and having received Information from Mr Jay, that Mr Oswald had rec<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">d</span> a Commission from the King his Master under the Great Seal of Great Britain, to treat with the Commissioners of the United States of America I Set off, for Paris, where I arrived, on Saturday the Twenty Sixth of this Month, after a tedious Journey, the Roads being on account of long continued Rains, in the worst Condition, I ever knew them.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0002" id="ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0002-ptr">2</a></p>
<p>I waited, forthwith, on Mr Jay, and from him learned the <del class="line-through" title="deleted in MS">present</del> State of the Conferences. It is not possible at present to enter into Details; All I can Say is in General that I had the Utmost Satisfaction in finding that he had been all along acting here upon the Same Principles upon which I had ventured to Act in Holland, and that We were perfectly agreed in our Sentiments and Systems. I cannot express it better than in his own Words To be honest and gratefull to our Allies, but to think for our selves.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0003" id="ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> I find a Construction put upon one Article of our Instructions by Some Persons, which I confess I never put upon it my self. it is represent by Some, as Subjecting Us to the french Ministry, as taking away from us, all right of Judging for ourselves, and obliging us to agree to whatever the french Ministers Shall advise us too, and to nothing without their Consent. I never Supposed this to be the Intention of Congress. if I had, I never would have accepted the Commission, and if I now thought it their Intention, I could not continue in it. I cannot think it possible to be the Design of Congress. if it is, I hereby <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0003">[3<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-14/ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0003.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>resign my Place in the Commission and request that another Person may be immediately appointed in my Stead.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0004" id="ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0004-ptr">4</a></p>
<p>Yesterday, We met Mr Oswald, at his Lodgings, Mr Jay Mr Franklin and my self on one Side and Mr Oswald assisted by Mr Stretchy, a Gentleman whom I had the Honour to meet in Company with Lord How upon Staten Island, in the year 1766 and assisted also by a Mr Roberts, a Clerk in Some of the public offices, with Books, Maps and Papers, relative to the Boundaries.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0005" id="ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> We have to Search, the Boundaries of Grenada the two Floridas, ancient Canada according to the Claims of the French, Proclamation Canada, Act of Parliament Canada &amp;c and the Bounds of Nova Scotia and of most if not all the thirteen States.</p>
<p>I arrived in a lucky moment, for the Boundary of the Massachusetts because I brought with me, all the essential Documents relative to that object, which are this day to be laid before the Gentle men my Colleagues in Conference at my House, and after wards, before <del class="line-through" title="deleted in MS">the Brit</del> Mr Oswald.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0006" id="ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0006-ptr">6</a></p>
<p>It is now apparent at least to Mr Jay and my self, that in order to obtain the Western Lands, the Navigation of the Missisipi, and the Fishery or any of them We must act with Firmness and Independence as well as Prudence and Delicacy. With these there is little doubt We may obtain them all.</p>
<p>Yesterday I visited Mr Brantzen the Dutch Minister, and was by him very frankly and candidly informed of the whole Progress of the Negotiation on their Part. it is very Shortly told. They have exchanged full Powers with Mr Fitzherbert, and communicated to him, their Preliminaries, according to their Instructions, which I have heretofore transmitted to Congress.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0007" id="ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0007-ptr">7</a> Mr Fitzherbert has Sent them to London and rec<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">d</span> an Answer. but has communicated to them no more of this Answer, than this, that those Preliminaries are not relished at St Jamess. He excused his not having Seen them for 6 or 7 days, by pretence of Indisposition, but they are informed he has made frequent Visits to Versailles during those days, and Sent off and received Several Couriers.</p>
<p>How the Negotiation advances, between Mr Fitzherbert and the C. de Vergennes and the C. DAranda, We know not.</p>
<p>The Object of Mr De Raynevals Journey to London, is not yet discovered by any of Us. It is given out, that he was Sent to See, whether, the British Ministry were in Earnest. But this is too general. it is Suspected that he went to insinuate Some thing relative to the Fishery and the Boundaries, but it is probable he did not Succeed <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0004">[4<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-14/ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0004.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>respecting the former, and perhaps not entirely with respect to the latter.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0008" id="ADMS-06-14-02-0002-fn-0008-ptr">8</a></p>

   <p><abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> described his conversation with Franklin that evening in his Diary entry for 30 Nov., the day on which the preliminary articles were signed. There <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> indicated that he and Franklin discussed the peace negotiations and the present State of our foreign affairs. <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> declared without Reserve my Opinion of the Policy of this Court, and of the Principles, Wisdom and Firmness with which Mr. Jay had conducted the Negotiation in his [<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Franklins</span>] Sickness and my Absence, and that I was determined to support Mr. Jay to the Utmost of my Power in the pursuit of the same System.

   <p>Henry Strachey, whose name <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> consistently misspelled, had been the secretary of the Howe Peace Commission when <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> met with it as a member of a congressional committee in the fall of 1776.

Strachey was sent from London with a clerk, W.

The two men probably arrived on 29 Oct., the day on which Oswald introduced Strachey to the American Commissioners (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Richard B.

   <p>In his letter to the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Boston Patriot</span> of 23 Oct. 1811, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> commented on the clerk, Roberts, as well as the documents he brought to exhibit at the conferences on 31 Oct. 1782. There he wrote that the British minister [<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">presumably Oswald</span>] introduced to us a special messenger from London as the oldest clerk in the board of trade and plantations, and a very respectable character He was sent over by the British cabinet with huge volumes of the original records of the board of trade and plantations, which they would not trust to any other messenger, in order to support their incontestable claim to the Province of Maine We all treated the gentleman and his records with respect After the usual ceremonies and salutations were over, the gentleman produced his manuscripts, and pointed to the passages he relied on, and read them.</p>


   <p>I said nothing at first, but I thought the British cabinet believed that Dr Franklin was too much of a philosopher to have been very attentive to these ancient transactions, and that Mr Adams and Mr Jay were too young to know any thing about themand therefore that they might by the venerable figure and imposing title of the most ancient clerk in the board of trade and plantations, and by the pompous appearance of enormous volumes of ancient records, be able to chicane us out of the Province of Maine, or at least to intimidate us into compromise, for the River Kennebec, or at the worst for Penobscot.</p>


   <p>When the aged stranger had read for sometime in his aged volumes, I observed that I had at my apartments documents which I flattered myself would sufficiently explain and refute whatever might be contained in those records, which should be construed or alledged against our right to the Province of Maine, and requested that the deliberation might be postponed till I could produce my books and papers. This was agreed. Accordingly at the next meeting I produced my documents.</p>

        
   <p>In issues of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Boston Patriot</span> for 23, 26 Oct., and 6, 9 Nov. 1811, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> described the documents that he brought to the negotiations and his use of them. Most important, perhaps, were copies of the Massachusetts charters of 1629, 1691, and 1728, and acts of the General Court relating to Maine and its borders. All of the documents are contained in two volumes, of which there are two sets, one the original and the other a duplicate. Both sets were prepared by John Avery, secretary of the commonwealth, and sent off under covering letters addressed to <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> and Francis Dana that were dated 17 Oct. 1780 <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0006">[6<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-14/ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0006.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>and 2 Jan. 1781 (all in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Miscellany (Used only to designate materials in the section of the Adams Papers known as the Miscellany and always in combination with the short form of the writers name and a serial number, as follows: M/CFA/32, i.e. the thirty-second volume of the Charles Francis Adams Miscellanya ledger volume mainly containing transcripts made by CFA in 1833 of selections from the family papers.) ]">M</abbr>/JA/1317, <span class="ref-terms" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;expan&gt;Formerly, Adams Papers, Microfilms.

   <p><abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> had additional documentation, either brought from America or procured in Europe. He indicates that he had a pretty thick quarto volume of the printed negotiations of Mr Maitland and Gov Shirley in the year 1754, in which many questions and perhaps all the questions relative to this subject, had been largely treated at Paris. The passage of time may have clouded <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s memory, as he is almost certainly referring to the 1749 Paris negotiations over the boundaries of British and French America between the British commissioners, William Shirley and William Mildmay, and the French commissioner, Etienne de Silhouette. In that case the work to which he refers was likely <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="foreign" xml:lang="fra">Mmoires des commissaires du roi et de ceux de Sa Majest britannique, sur les possessions &amp; les droits respectifs des deux couronnes en Amrique; a avec les actes publics &amp; pices justificatives</span></span>, 4 vols., Paris, 17551757. But <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> also had the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Journals</span> of the Massachusetts House of Representatives for at least the years 1762 through 1766. In the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Boston Patriot</span> he cites in particular the volumes for 1762 and 1763. In the appendix to the latter volume is A Brief State of the Title of the Province of Massachusetts-Bay to the Country between the Rivers Kennebeck and St. Croix, which is also among the items copied by John Avery. In the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Boston Patriot</span> <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> quotes a substantial portion of that document, which he indicates that he read to the British negotiators.
