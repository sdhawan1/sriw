The committee defined terms, such as Real British Subjects, used in Art. 5 of the peace treaty, and then affirmed the legality of the confiscation of the estates of those who had specifically been called Conspirators in the act of 30 April 1779 or who had actively supported the war against the United States. But it held out the possibility that the estates of others, who did not fall into those categories, might be restored in the future and declared, that the laws heretofore made directing and empowering Justices of the peace to commit, to Goal, &amp; the Governor to transport out of the State absentees and others therein mentioned, are nullified by the Treaty, so far as they respect those persons whose estates have not been confiscated, &amp; ought to be so declared by this Legislature. It was presumably the perception of a lack of rigor toward the loyalists in these final two proposals that led to the report being referred to the next sitting of the General Court. But as Dalton indicates (see note 6), the General Court did not wait until the next session to act.

committee appointed to consider whether it was proper and expedient to admit as town residents, persons, who in the course of the late war have adhered to the cause of Great-Britain against these United States, and are of fair characters. The committee declared that it is our opinion that, in point of law and constitution, it will be proper to admit, as inhabitants of this town, such persons as are specificated in said vote; but that no persons who have committed unauthorized and lawless plundering and murder, or have waged war against these United States, contrary to the laws and usages of civilized nations, ought on any account to be admitted. Regarding the expediency of such a measure, the committee declared that no nation, however distinguished for prowess in arms, and success in war, can be considered as truely great, unless it is also distinguished for justice and magnanimity; and no people can, with the least propriety, lay claim to the character of being <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">just,</span> who violate their most solemn treaties, or of being <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">magnanimous</span> who presecute a conquered and submitting enemy: That therefore the present and future national glory of the United States, is deeply concerned in their conduct relative to the persons described in said vote. Also mentioned as a reason for admitting such people was New Havens future commercial prosperity (supplement to the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Connecticut Courant,</span> 6 April).

The Virginia proposal was brought before the General Court on 16 March, but as Dalton indicates it took no action regarding it. By the May session of the General Court, Congress had resolved, on 30 April, to recommend to the states that they empower Congress for the term of fifteen years, with power to prohibit any goods, wares or merchandize from being imported into or exported from any of the states, in vessels belonging to or navigated by the subjects of any power with whom these states shall not have formed treaties of Commerce. The resolution also would prohibit the importation of any goods not the production of such countries. On 1 July the General Court enacted a bill virtually identical in language to Congress resolution, but with the proviso that the grant of such power to Congress, as in the Virginia act, would not become effective until all of the states had adopted similar laws (<span class="ref-terms" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;expan&gt;Records of the States of the United States of America: [[Massachusetts]], comp. and ed.

   <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">During the war Massachusetts and the other states incurred large debts owing to military expenditures made at the behest of Congress. For Massachusetts the issue was complicated by the expense of the ill-fated 1779 Penobscot expedition, which it undertook unilaterally but against the common foe, and the large sums of worthless continental currency that had flowed into the states treasury because the bills retained their value longer in Massachusetts than elsewhere. Like its sister states, Massachusetts wanted Congress to compensate it for its wartime expenditures. Initially there appeared to be little difficulty in differentiating the debt for which Congress would reimburse the states and that for which the states were individually responsible. Thus it was that Congress, on 20 Feb. 1782, adopted an ordinance under which the proportions to be borne by the several states of the expences of the war, from the commencement thereof until the first day of January, 1782 would be determined. To do so, the superintendant of finance would nominate a commissioner for each state subject to the approval of the states legislature or executive. In practice the scheme was unworkable because each state differed in how it had accounted for its expenses, and the definition of authorized and unauthorized expenses (e.g., the Penobscot expedition) varied widely from state to state. When the ordinance failed to resolve the issue, the Continental Congress was forced over the remainder of its life to propose a variety of solutions, none of which were successful. The issue was not finally laid to rest until 1790 when, under the new Constitution, Alexander Hamilton proposed and Congress approved the federal assumption of the states debt (Fergusion, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Power of the Purse,</span> p. 203219; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789,&lt;/i&gt; ed.

   <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Uncertainty about the border between Nova Scotia and Maine, then part of Massachusetts, as set down in Art. 2 of the definitive peace treaty, resulted from the inaccurate maps used by the American and British negotiators and also because at least three rivers in the disputed area were or had been called the St. Croix. Various efforts were made to resolve the problem, including in Art. 5 of the 1794 Jay Treaty and Art. 5 of the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, but it and other outstanding Anglo-American boundary disputes were not finally settled until 1842 with the signing of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty (vol. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-15-02-0114#ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0246" class="pageNo">15:246247</a>; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America,&lt;/i&gt; ed.
