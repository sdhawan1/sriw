When they have reachd the summit of Grandeur, some minute and unsuspected Cause commonly effects their Ruin, and the Empire of the world is transferrd to some other place. Immortal Rome was at first but an insignificant Village, inhabited only by a few abandoned Ruffins, but by degrees it rose to a stupendous Height, and excelld in Arts and Arms all the Nations that praeceeded it. But the demolition of Carthage (what one should think would have establishd it in supream dominion) by removing all danger, sufferd it to sink into debauchery, and made it att length an easy prey to Barbarians.England Immediately, upon this began to increase (the particular, and minute causes of which I am not Historian enough to trace) in Power and magnificence, and is now the greatest Nation upon the globe.Soon after the Reformation a few people came over into this new world for Concience sake. Perhaps this (apparently) trivial incident, may transfer the great seat of Empire into America. It looks likely to me. For if we can remove the turbulent Gallicks, our People according to the exactest Computations, will in another Century, become more numerous than England itself. Should this be the Case, since we have (I may say) all the naval Stores of the Nation in our hands, it will be easy to obtain the mastery of the seas, and then the united force of all Europe, will not be able to subdue us. The only way to keep us from setting up for ourselves, is to disunite Us. Divide et impera. Keep us in distinct Colonies, and then, some great men, in each Colony, desiring the Monarchy of the Whole, they will destroy each others influence and keep the Country in Equilibrio.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d005n1" id="PJA01d005n1-ptr">1</a></p>

     <p>Quincy April 22 1807. Nathan Webb was the Son of the late Deacon Jonathan Webb of Quincy and the Grandson of Benjamin Webb of the same place. The Father and Grandfather were intimate Friends of my Father and Grandfather, and the Grandson was my Playfellow at the Grammar School in Braintree, and my Contemporary at Colledge. He had Wit, humour and good Nature, equal to his Understanding And Judgment which were very good. He died young, and I attended him in his last Sickness, with equal Grief and assiduity, and watched with him a Night or two before his death. He left this Letter and some others in possession of his Father, who left it with his whole Estate to his Nephew, Captain Jonathan Webb, now of this Town living in the old Seat of the Family, who about a fortnight ago was kind enough to send it to me, after it had lain fifty one years and an half among the Papers of the Family in Oblivion. It was written soon after I took my first degree at Colledge, and some days before I was twenty years old. Nathan was named after his Unkle Nathan Webb the Minister of Uxbridge, who married my Fathers Sister.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA01d005n3" id="PJA01d005n3-ptr">3</a></p>

   <p>The characteristic reflections in this early, but later celebrated, letter had at least two identifiable sources. One was the course of the current French and Indian War, in which the British had recently suffered serious reverses, notably in Braddocks defeat near Fort Duquesne and in other actions on and around the lakes above the Hudson. Thus, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> mentions just below, the dira [<ins title="editorial addition or explanation" class="ed">evils, sufferings</ins>] of War. The possibility of the fall of the British Empire brought on a line of thought popular throughout the 18th century and memorably expressed in Bishop Berkeleys Verses on the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America (written 1707, published 1752), ending with the stanza, Westward the course of empire takes its way;. . . / Times noblest offspring is the last. The plausible suggestion has also been made (John A. Schutz and Douglass Adair, eds., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">The Spur of Fame</span>. . . , San Marino, Calif., 1966, p. 81, note) that <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> had been reading Benjamin Franklins remarkable essay Observations concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, &amp;c. (written 1751, published 1755; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Papers of Benjamin Franklin&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

Here Franklin predicted that America would rapidly overtake England in population. The prospect of Americas succeeding England as the seat of empire, or becoming itself a powerful independent empire, was a natural inference for <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> to draw.</p>

In his Diary, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Quincy Adams (17671848), son of John and Abigail Adams ]">JQA</abbr> was equally laudatory but briefer, and concentrated on one aspect of the letterthe closing passage on friendshipwhich he felt had been overlooked by others but was the best of all the good things in it. It is A Letter, he wrote, in the Analysis of which I find so much matter for commentary that a sober judgment must be called in to curb enthusiastic admiration. I propose to give the Letter entire, for it is the foot of Hercules. Nothing that my father ever wrote in the subsequent course of his life, bears in more indelible characters the stamp of his genius and of his heart. Webster and Wirt have both spoken of this Letter, with high commendation, but neither of them has noticed the part of it which is most deeply affecting to meits encomium, tender and sublime, upon friendship. If I should say that the annals of epistolary correspondence cannot furnish a Letter more replete at once with intellect and heart, I should commit no excess. (Entry of 15 Sept. 1829.)</p>
