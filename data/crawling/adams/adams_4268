<p>Whereas certain of the United States excited thereto by the unnecessary Destruction of private Property have confiscated all Debts due from their Citizens to British Subjects; and also in certain Instances Lands belonging to the latter.</p>

<p>And whereas it is just that private Contracts made between Individuals of the two Countries before the War, should be faithfully executed; and as the Confiscation of the said Lands may have a Latitude not justifiable by the Law of NationsIt is agreed that British Creditors shall notwithstanding meet with no lawfull Impediment to recovering the full Value, or Sterling amount of such bona fide Debts as were contracted before the year 1775. And also that Congress will recommend to the said States so to correct (if necessary,) their said Acts respecting the Confiscation of Lands in America belonging to real British Subjects, as to render the said Acts consistent with perfect Justice &amp; Equity.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-14-02-0010-fn-0010" id="ADMS-06-14-02-0010-fn-0010-ptr">10</a> As to the Cession made of certain Lands in Georgia, by a number of Indians there, on the first June 1773, for the purpose of paying the Debts due from them to a number of TradersThe American Commissioners say, that the State of Georgia is alone competent to consider &amp; decide on the same: for that it being a matter of internal Police, with which neither Congress nor their Commissioners are authorised to interfere, it must of necessity be referred to the Discretion, &amp; Justice of that State, who without doubt will be disposed to do, what may be just &amp; reasonable on the Subject.</p>

   <p>The document printed here, with its additions and deletions, is the final product of the negotiations that took place on 3 and 4 November. In his Diary entry for 3 Nov., <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> describes the discussions among the American Commissioners about the terms of the treaty and the nature of their response to the British negotiators. <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s Diary for 4 Nov. indicates that he called on J. and went to Oswalds and spent with him and Stretchy from 11. to 3. in drawing up the Articles respecting Debts and Tories and Fishery and also that he, and presumably Jay, were in the Evening there again, untill near 11 (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Diary and Autobiography of John Adams&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

It was the basis for the text that Henry Strachey carried back to London for consideration by the Shelburne ministry. That seems evident from the revisions entered in the text and described in the notes since a comparison of the manuscript and <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s Letterbook copy shows that with the editorial changes it is identical to the copy sent off with Strachey.

   <p>In the Letterbook, the American Commissioners are listed as John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and John Jay. This is the order in which they appeared in the <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0058#ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0103" class="pageNo">preliminary treaty signed on 30 Nov.</a>, below, but it also reflects the order of names in the <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-11-02-0276-0001" class="document">15 June 1781 joint commission</a> (vol. 11:373).</p>

   <p>To this point the text is almost identical to that of the articles agreed to in October. Aside from substantive textual changes from this point on, the most apparent difference between the 8 Oct. and [<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">4 Nov.</span>] versions is that the second has no numbered articles (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

   <p>With the exception of this passage establishing the northern boundary line as the 45th parallel from its intersection of the Connecticut River to the point at which it struck the Mississippi River, the provision establishing the boundaries of the United States is substantially the same as the corresponding passage in the 8 Oct. articles. The difference is that in the earlier version the passage from this point to the following colon reads, to the northermost head of the Connecticut River; thence down along the middle of that river to the 45th degree of north latitude, and thence due west in the latitude 45 degrees north from the equator, to the northwesternmost side of the river St. Lawrence or Cadaraqui; thence straight to the south end of the Lake Nipissing, and thence straight to the source of the river Mississippi (same, p. 806). The provision in the 8 Oct. articles followed the instruction regarding boundaries originally given to <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> in Oct. 1779 and renewed in the joint commissions instructions of June 1781. When that was rejected, the commissioners turned to the alternative proposal included in the instructions (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Diary and Autobiography of John Adams&lt;/i&gt;, ed. L. H.

The practical consequences of the two proposals were that under the 8 Oct. draft the United States would have included all of Ontario south of Lake Nipissing but excluded the upper peninsula of Michigan and the northeast portion of Minnesota; while under the [<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">4 Nov.</span>] version the new nation would have included Ontario south of the 45th parallel but excluded the northern portion of Michigans lower peninsula and all of the upper peninsula, the northern half of Wisconsin, and a larger portion of northeastern Minnesota. However, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> indicates in <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0015" class="document">his letter to Livingston of 6 Nov.</a>, below, that the commissioners had offered the British negotiators the alternative of running the northern boundary thro the middle of all the <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0022">[22<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-14/ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0022.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>great lakes.

   <p>This paragraph was included because the 8 Oct. draft treaty did not mention the loyalists, and the Shelburne ministry could not agree to a treaty with such an omission. The conditional amnesty and restitution provided here was equally unacceptable, as was indicated by <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0009" class="document">Richard Oswald in his letter of 4 Nov.</a>, above, and <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0012" class="document">Henry Strachey in his of 5 Nov.</a>, below. In their response to <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0021" class="document">Oswald of 7 Nov.</a>, below, the American Commissioners indicated that, insofar as the loyalists were concerned, they were unwilling to go further. For the Shelburne ministrys renewed effort to do something meaningful for the loyalists, see Arts. 5 and 6 of the draft treaty of 25 Nov. that Strachey brought from London. For the commissioners refusal to go significantly beyond the terms in this paragraph, see the draft article on the loyalists of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0051" class="document">[<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">ca. 26 Nov.</span>]</a> and Arts. 5 and 6 of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0058" class="document">the preliminary treaty signed on 30 Nov.</a>, both below.</p>

   <p>Taken verbatim from the beginning of Art. 4 of the 8 Oct. draft (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States&lt;/i&gt;, ed. Francis Wharton, Washington, 1889; 6 vols. ]">Wharton, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev.</span></span>, 5:807), this sentence, with the addition of the words to the Subjects of Great Britain and Citizens of the United States, was retained as Art. 8 of both the 25 Nov. draft and the 30 Nov. preliminary treaty. In the 8 Oct. draft, however, Art. 4 was made much longer by the addition of text providing for virtually unlimited Anglo-American free trade. When the Shelburne cabinet considered the 8 Oct. draft, some objected that such a provision was too liberal a concession to the United States and that in any case such a provision would be more appropriate in a commercial treaty concluded following the peace. Although <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> was not a party to the drafting of the article, its inclusion was in line with his view as expressed in numerous letters written after the signing of the preliminary treaty, that the best time to regularize Anglo-American trade was during the peace negotiations.</p>

        
   <p>The possibility of some form of Anglo-American free trade did not die with the cabinets decision. In March 1783 the substance of the drafts provision was included <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0023">[23<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-14/ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0023.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>in the abortive American Intercourse Bill, for which see <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0220" class="document">Edmund Jenings letter of 14 March 1783</a>, and note 1, below. More intriguing was its resurrection during the 1783 negotiations between David Hartley and the American Commissioners over the definitive treaty. On 21 May, Hartley offered to insert the provision, virtually unchanged from the 8 Oct. draft, in the definitive treaty. The commissioners agreed, with some modifications, on the following day (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Diary and Autobiography of John Adams&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

British opposition to further concessions, however, precluded its inclusion in the definitive treaty of 3 Sept. 1783, with the result that eleven years passed before a formal Anglo-American commercial agreement was concluded, and then it was under the far more restrictive provisions of Jays Treaty.</p>

   <p>For the original form of this provision, see the canceled text at note 6. Not included in the 8 Oct. draft, this separate article reflected the preference of the commissioners in general and John Jay in particular for British control of West Florida due to their irritation at Spains effort to limit the western boundaries of the United States and its failure to recognize the new nation (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Richard B.

It was retained in both the <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0048" class="document">25 Nov. draft</a> and the <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0058" class="document">30 Nov. preliminary treaty,</a> both below, but Congress did not ratify it, fearing that it would antagonize France and Spain; and Britains conclusion of preliminary peace treaties with France and Spain rendered the provision moot.</p>
