   <p>(It is unclear whether the addition made in this 18th article, as far as people who find themselves within the country, was taken from several old treaties, in the words if anything be taken from them, which would denote the taking of prizes at sea. If yes, it appears to have no effect. It is hereby proposed to keep the first section and clarify the second section, making it more elaborate as is found in the 41st article of aforementioned treaty of 1713, which reads as follows:)</p>


   <p>(1) their High Mightinesses, the States General of the United Netherlands and the United States of North America, there shall always be granted to the subjects on each side the term of nine months after the date of the rupture or the proclamation of war, to the end that they may retire with their effects and transport them where they please, which it shall be lawful for them to do; as well as to sell or transport their effects and goods in all freedom and without any hindrance, and without being able to proceed, during the said term of nine months, to any arrest of their effects, much less of their persons; on the contrary, there shall be given them, for their vessels and effects which they would carry away, passports and safe conducts, for the nearest ports of their respective countries, and for the time necessary for the voyage. And no prize made at sea shall be judged lawful, at least if the declaration of war was not or could not be known in the last port which the vessel taken has quitted. But for whatever may have been taken from the subjects and inhabitants of either party, and for the offenses which may have been given them in the interval of the said terms, a complete satisfaction shall be given them.</p>

   <p>With minor variations, the drafts preamble is identical to that in the Lee-Neufville Treaty. The preamble in the treaty plan, however, is also similar and probably was based on the form in the Lee-Neufville Treaty.

In fact, this and the following two paragraphs, the first of which was largely retained in the final treaty (No. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-13-02-0162-0011-0002" class="document">VIII</a>, below), dealing with the plenipotentiaries authorized to sign the treaty, are <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s work, for neither the Lee-Neufville Treaty nor Congress treaty plan have a comparable section. <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> may have used the corresponding sections in the Franco-American treaties of 1778 as a model, although their text is not identical to that in the draft.</p>

The second brings the draft into accord with the official French text of Art. 1 in the 1778 Franco-American Treaty of Amity and Commerce, which reads at this point et de lieux, which should be translated as and places.

   <p>The most contentious issue during the negotiations, or at least the one that provoked the most discussion, involved Dutch objections to Arts. 22 and 23 and their deletion or replacement with a new article. For a detailed explanation from the Dutch perspective of the issues involved, see Adriaan van Zeeberghs <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-13-02-0126-0002-0002" class="document">25 July</a> commentary on the two articles (above). The deletion of the proposal to remove the two articles entirely and the proposed replacement stem from Amsterdams 9 Aug. recommendations, and the substitute article is an accurate rendering of Amsterdams proposal. But see also <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s comments in his responses (No. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-13-02-0162-0004" class="document">III</a>, below), another suggested replacement that was not used (No. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-13-02-0162-0007" class="document">IV</a>, below), and Art. 22 in the final treaty (No. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-13-02-0162-0011-0002" class="document">VIII</a>, below).</p>

<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="ADMS-06-13-02-pb-0330">[330]</span>

   <p>The Dutch objections to the two articles and their initial request that they be removed altogether have substance. This is because neither <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s draft nor the changes suggested by the Dutch contained anything that would have put the Dutch-American Treaty in any obvious conflict with the 1778 Franco-American treaties of amity and commerce or alliance. And if a conflict did develop, the law of nations required that the earlier treaty take precedence over the later one. Article 22 is identical to Art. 21 of Congress Treaty Plan of 1780 except that where Congress referred to a treaty, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> identified the two treaties specifically (vol. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-10-02-0260#ADMS-06-10-02-pb-0457" class="pageNo">10:457</a>). But Art. 23 was wholly <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s work, for it does not appear in the treaty plan, and in drafting it, he went beyond the terms of Congress treaty plan and his instructions. Neither mentioned Spain or its right to accede to the treaty of alliance under the terms of Art. 10 of that treaty or, more specifically, to both treaties according to the Acte Spar et Secret that had also been signed on 6 Feb. 1778 (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed. Hunter Miller, Washington, D.C., 19311948; 8 vols. ]">Miller, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Treaties</span></span>, 2:39, 4547). In fact, Art. 23 was likely the product of <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s 16 Aug. 1781 <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-11-02-0338" class="document">commission</a> and <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-11-02-0339" class="document">instructions</a>, which he had not disclosed to the Dutch, to conclude a tripartite alliance between the United States, France, and the Netherlands or a quadruple alliance should Spain wish to join under the terms of the Franco-American Treaty (vol. 11:453456). Indeed, unless the Dutch were aware of the secret provision, Art. 23 must have seemed a very odd article to include in a treaty with the Netherlands because the Franco-American commercial treaty made no mention of any Spanish right of accession.</p>

The changes that <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> accepted to the article enumerating contraband represent a significant departure from his instructions from Congress for negotiating a Dutch-American treaty and also from the Lee-Neufville Treaty and the 1778 Franco-American Treaty of Amity and Commerce (vol. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-10-02-0258" class="document">10:448</a>; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

Instead of a long catalog of items that were not to be considered contraband, the Dutch proposed that any merchandise not specifically designated as contraband be considered free. This was in line with Russias 19 May 1780 ordinance concerning commerce and navigation that formed the basis for the Armed Neutrality of which the Netherlands was a member. It should also be noted that the proposal was less detailed, and thus less restrictive, than the provisions of the 26 Jan. 1781 Dutch ordinance concerning commerce and navigation (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Armed Neutralities of 1780 and 1800: A Collection of Official Documents Preceded by the Views of Representative Publicists&lt;/i&gt;, ed.
