      <p>THE end of the institution, maintenance and administration of government, is to secure the existence of the body-politic; to protect it; and to furnish the individuals who compose it, with the power of enjoying, in safety and tranquility, their natural rights, and the blessings of life: And whenever these great objects are not obtained, the people have a right to alter the government, and to take measures necessary for their safety, happiness and prosperity.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA08d168n2" id="PJA08d168n2-ptr">2</a></p>
      <p>T<span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">he</span> body politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals: It is a social compact, by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good. It is the duty of the people, therefore, in framing a Constitution of Government, to provide for an equitable mode of making laws, as well as for an impartial interpretation; and a faithful execution of them, that every man may, at all times, find his security in them.</p>

       <p>The rejected Constitution of 1778 had referred to the State of Massachusetts Bay. Virginia called itself a Commonwealth in its 1776 constitution, and <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> promptly endorsed the term. He urged it upon Jonathan Dickinson Sergeant for New Jersey in July 1776 and told Francis Dana in August of that year that he hoped Massachusetts would adopt it (vol. <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-08-02-pb-0262">[262<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-08/ADMS-06-08-02-pb-0262.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>4:<a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-04-02-0173" class="document">397</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-04-02-0213" class="document">466</a>). Commonwealth had also been favored over state, although not exclusively, in Pennsylvanias constitution of 1776, and was used interchangeably with state in the constitutions of Maryland (1776) and Vermont (1777). It would later be employed in Kentucky.</p>
       <p>A commonwealth indicated a society in which ultimate political power was vested in the people, a meaning not automatically implied in the word state. For <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> the term declared a connection between Revolutionary America and Englands seventeenth-century Commonwealthmen, especially James Harrington. An unnamed delegate to the Massachusetts convention sought to honor Harrington even more directly when, on 9 Nov., he moved that Massachusetts rename itself the Commonwealth of Oceana, after Harringtons great theoretical tract of that name, published in 1656. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-08-02-0161-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA08d168n37#PJA08d168n37" class="document">note 37</a>.</p>

       <p>The convention decided to confine chapter designations to the Frame of Government, and to call the Declaration of Rights Part the First, and the Frame Part the Second. In the annotation of the Declaration of Rights, references to articles in the constitutions of other states are to the declarations or bills of rights, which were often numbered separately from the portions of those documents dealing with the form or frame of government.</p>

       <p>The words and season were added after manner, a change that perhaps made Sundays less exclusively the major day for worship. The use of the term subject here and in Arts. III, XI, XII, and XIV is unique to the Massachusetts declaration. Other bills of rights use man, person, or freeman everywhere. It may be that subject was an inadvertent retention of old usage. Before the Revolution all Americans were subjects of the crown, that is, owed allegiance to the king of Great Britain. The term lingered on and came to mean a person subject to the laws as distinct from a citizen, who enjoyed political rights. But this distinction seems not to have been made by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>, for in Art.

III: The Article respecting Religion. . . was the only Article which I omitted to draw.

In a more revealing oral statement, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> elaborated: I found I could not sketch, consistent with my own sentiments of perfect religious freedom, with any hope of its being adopted by the Convention, so I left it to be battled out in the whole body (as stated to Josiah Quincy and recorded in the latters diary entry for 31 May 1820, in Edmund Quincy, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Life of Josiah Quincy</span>, Boston, 1867, p. 379). If <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> really thought that Some of the Clergy, or older and graver Persons could draft a more popular article, however, he was mistaken. Art. III of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Report</span> caused over a week of contentious debate, and was completely rewritten. The final version was one of the least liked parts of the finished document, and Samuel Eliot Morison demonstrated that the article did not secure the required two-thirds vote for ratification in 1780, although it was declared, with the rest of the Constitution, to be ratified (Morison, The Struggle over the Adoption of the Constitution of Massachusetts, 1780, <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Massachusetts Historical Society, &lt;i&gt;Collections&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Proceedings.&lt;/i&gt; ]">MHS, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Procs.</span></span>, 50 (19161917): <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-08-02-pb-0263">[263<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-08/ADMS-06-08-02-pb-0263.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>353411).

       <p>The convention deleted the word male, although in the Frame of Government voting rights were restricted to males. During the convention more than one attempt was made to exclude male from voting qualifications, but the move attracted little support (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the Convention for Framing a Constitution of Government for the State of Massachusetts Bay from ...

Possibly the deletion of the term in Art. IX had no more significance than that specific voting qualifications were thought best confined to the Frame of Government, as suggested by the addition to this article of the phrase as they shall establish by their frame of government after having sufficient qualifications. Art. IX is generally patterned after Pennsylvanias Art. VII, which owed a few phrases to Virginias Sect. 6. That elections ought to be free is from declaration No. 8 of Englands Bill of Rights of 1689.</p>

       <p>The convention dropped the word standing but otherwise left Art. XVIII (now XVII) intact. The principles that standing armies require consent and that Protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions are in Englands Bill of Rights, Nos. 6 and 7. <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>, who followed Pennsylvanias Art.

       <p>The rest of Art. II was deleted. Some convention members expressed fears that the House would grow too large, but most were willing to leave that worry to the future. In the vigorous debates over representation that took place in the convention, efforts were made to permit every town, regardless of size, to have one representative; or, if not that, to associate with some other town to elect a representative, as <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> proposed in this article, adapting the idea from Art. VI of the Constitution of 1778. The only compromise the majority would make was to permit incorporated towns with fewer than 150 ratable polls which then enjoyed the right to choose a representative to continue to exercise that right (William Cushings notes on the debates, [Oct.? 1779], Commissions, Cushing Papers, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Massachusetts Historical Society ]">MHi</span>; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the Convention for Framing a Constitution of Government for the State of Massachusetts Bay from ...

       <p>The convention removed Art. IV, rewrote the two-part oath so that it would cover the governor, lieutenant governor, Council members, and legislators, and transferred the whole oath to a separate chapter that covered a variety of subjects, Chapter VI. The first part of the oath was kept substantially intact despite the conventions elimination of christian from the qualifications for Council members and legislators. The second part of the oath, now meant as well for any person appointed or commissioned, was greatly lengthened. One had to declare that Massachusetts was rightfully a free, sovereign and independent State, that one abjured Great Britain and all other foreign powers, civil and ecclesiastical, and that no one could discharge the taker from the oaths obligations.

       <p>The denial of any pardon power before conviction was more extensively stated here than in any other early state constitution and was a departure from English practice. William Blackstone held that a royal pardon could be pleaded at arraignment, before judgment, or to prevent carrying out a judgment (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Commentaries</span>, 4 vols., Phila., 17711772, 4:258, 392, 394395). Only New Jersey and New York limited the timing of a pardon. New Jersey permitted pardons after condemnation, a term of uncertain meaning, since it could mean either a jurys verdict of guilty or a judges sentence. New York gave the governor power to pardon those convicted of crimes, except murder or treason. Probably <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s intention was to prevent those charged with crimes from being pardoned before the facts of their crimes were exposed to public view.

       <p>The convention replaced this article with a much longer one that denied the governor the power to appoint militia officers, in favor of the old tradition under which the officers were elected by the militiamen. These in turn were to elect field officers, who were to elect brigadiers. Major generals were to be chosen by the two legislative houses, each with a veto on the other. The governor was limited to commissioning officers elected and determining their rank in order of seniority. Commanding officers were left free to name their adjutants and aides.

       <p>Art. VI became Art. VII under the new Chapter VI. The proper limitation to put upon the legislative suspension of the privilege of habeas corpus was one of the more extensively debated issues in the convention. The final wording of Art. VII substituted for <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s concluding phrase: for a limited time not exceeding twelve months. A number of convention members sought greater curbs on this legislative power. They would have restricted suspension to not more than forty days and applied it only in wartime to those charged with being in the interest of the enemy. These proposals were voted down 21 to 14 in February, when relatively few delegates were in attendance. A tie vote on the twelve-month limitation was broken by convention president James Bowdoin, who supported it. A proposal to restrict suspension to time of war, rebellion, or invasion, declared or apprehended by the Legislature brought another tie vote, with Bowdoin upholding the simple twelve-month limitation (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the Convention for Framing a Constitution of Government for the State of Massachusetts Bay from ...

       <p>This section of the constitution was drafted mainly by a Harvard College committee. Convention president James Bowdoin had alerted Harvards president that the drafting committee had been instructed to prepare an article confirming the schools privileges. A committee of the Harvard Corporation prepared Arts. I and II, which were approved by the full Corporation and by the Overseers, and then submitted to the conventions drafting committee for approval. Art.

Of central importance was his keen interest in the natural history collections that he had seen on his travels to and from the Continental Congress and in France, and his admiration for the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia and the learned societies of France and England. These feelings prompted <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>, at a dinner held at Harvard on 24 Aug. 1779 to honor the new French minister to the United States, the Chevalier de La Luzerne, to propose to the Rev. Samuel Cooper the founding of a learned society in Boston that might emulate those of Philadelphia and Europe.

That document, in Sect. 44, not only called for the establishment of schools in each county but added all useful learning shall be duly encouraged and promoted in one or more universities. Coincidentally, the General Court on 28 May 1779 had appointed a five-man committee, composed of Robert Treat Paine, John Pickering, Col. Loammi Baldwin, Theophilus Parsons, and Samuel Phillips Jr., to prepare a resolve for the encouragement of learning in this State (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts&lt;/i&gt; [[1715 ]], Boston, reprinted by the Massachusetts Historical Society, 1919.

Although no report appears to have been made, all of these legislators except Baldwin were later members of the convention, and Paine, Parsons, and Phillips were members of the committee of thirty assigned to draft the constitution. These possible influences in no way detract from <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s enlightened conception of governments positive role in promoting the intellectual, cultural, and technological advancement and well-being of its people, a conception that his son, as president, took for his own.</p>

       <p>The convention relabeled this last part of the Constitution Chapter VI, and completely revised and greatly expanded it. The new chapters Art. I, which contained the oaths of officeholding, drew upon and expanded parts of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Reports</span> Chapter III, Sect. I (on the governor), and Sect. 3 (the Council). Art. II applied the prohibition against plural officeholding made in Chapter IV of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Report</span> (the judiciary) far more broadly and in much greater detail. Art. III came from Chapter III, Sect. 2 (lieutenant governor); and Arts. IVVIII from Chapter V (delegates to congress, etc.). The specific articles or parts of articles transferred are indicated in the notes to those chapters and sections. The <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Reports</span> Chapter VII. and last then became Art. IX of the new chapter, and the convention added Arts. X and XI. Art.
