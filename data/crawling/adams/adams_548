      <p>The frailty of human Nature, the Wants of Individuals, and the numerous Dangers which surround them, through the Course of Life, have in all Ages, and in every Country impelled them to form Societies, and establish Governments.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d245n1" id="PJA03d245n1-ptr">1</a></p>
      <p>As the Happiness of the People <del title="deleted text">&lt;alone&gt;</del>, is the sole End of Government, So the Consent of the People is the only Foundation of it, in Reason, Morality, and the natural Fitness of things: and therefore every Act of Government, every Exercise of Sovereignty, against, or without, the Consent of the People, is Injustice, Usurpation, and Tyranny.</p>
      <p>It is a Maxim, that in every Government, there must exist Somewhere, a Supreme, Sovereign, absolute, and uncontroulable Power:<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d245n2" id="PJA03d245n2-ptr">2</a> But this power resides always in the Body of the People, and it never was, or can be delegated, to one Man, or a few, the great Creator having never given to Men a right to vest others with Authority over them, unlimited either in Duration or Degree.</p>
      <p>When Kings, Ministers, Governors, or Legislators therefore, instead of exercising the Powers intrusted <del title="deleted text">&lt;to their Care&gt;</del><a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d245n3" id="PJA03d245n3-ptr">3</a> with them according to the Principles, Forms and Proportions stated by the Constitution, and established by the original Compact, prostitute <del title="deleted text">&lt;it&gt;</del> those Powers to the Purposes of Oppression; to Subvert, instead of Supporting a free Constitution; to destroy, instead of preserving the lives, <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0384">[384<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-03/ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0384.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>Liberties and Properties of the People: they are no longer to be deemed Magistrates vested with a Sacred Character; but become public Enemies, and ought to be resisted. <del title="deleted text">&lt;by open War&gt;</del><a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d245n4" id="PJA03d245n4-ptr">4</a></p>
      <p>The Administration of Great Britain, despising equally the Justice, the Humanity and Magnanimity of their Ancestors, and the Rights, Liberties and Courage of Americans have, for a Course of <del title="deleted text">&lt;Twelve&gt;</del> years,<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d245n5" id="PJA03d245n5-ptr">5</a> laboured to establish a Sovereignty in America, not founded in the Consent of the People, but in the mere Will of Persons a thousand Leagues from Us, whom we know not, and have endeavoured to establish this Sovereignty over us, against our Consent, in all Cases whatsoever.</p>
      <p>The Colonies during this period, have recurrd to every <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[peaceable Resource]</span> in a free Constitution, by Petitions and Remonstrances, to <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[obtain justice;]</span> which has been not only denied to them, but they have been <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[treated with unex]</span>ampled Indignity and Contempt and at length open War <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[of the most]</span> atrocious, cruel and Sanguinary Kind has been commenced <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[against them.]</span> To this, an open manly and successfull Resistance has hith<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[erto been made.]</span> Thirteen Colonies are now firmly united in the Conduct of this most just and necessary War, under the wise Councils of their Congress.</p>
      <p>It is the Will of Providence, for wise, righteous, and gracious Ends, that this Colony Should have been singled out, by the Enemies of America, as the first object both of their Envy and their Revenge; and after having been made the Subject of Several merciless and vindictive Statutes, one of which was intended to subvert our Constitution by Charter, is made the Seat of War.</p>
      <p>No effectual Resistance to the System of Tyranny prepared for us, could be made without either instant Recourse to Arms, or a temporary Suspension of the ordinary Powers of Government, and Tribunals of Justice: to the last of which Evils, in hopes of a Speedy Reconciliation with Great Britain, upon equitable Terms the Congress advised us to submit: and Mankind has seen a Phenomenon without Example<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d245n6" id="PJA03d245n6-ptr">6</a> in the political World, a large and populous Colony subsisting in <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[great]</span> Decency and order, for more than a Year <del title="deleted text">&lt;without Government&gt;</del><a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d245n7" id="PJA03d245n7-ptr">7</a> under such a suspension of Government.</p>
      <p>But as our Enemies have proceeded to such barbarous Extremities commencing Hostilities upon the good People of this Colony, and with unprecedented <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Malice]</span> exerting their Power to spread the Calamities of Fire, Sword and Famine through the Land, and no reasonable Prospect remains of a speedy Reconciliation with Great Britain, the Congress have resolved That no Obedience being due to the Act of <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0385">[385<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-03/ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0385.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>Parliament for altering the Charter of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, nor to a Governor or Lieutenant Governor, who will not observe the Directions of, but endeavour to subvert that Charter; the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of that Colony are to be considered as Absent, and their offices vacant; and as there is no Council there, and Inconveniences arising from the Suspension of the Powers of Government are intollerable, especially at a Time when Gage hath actually levied War and is carrying on Hostilities against his Majesties peaceable and loyal Subjects of that Colony; that in order to conform as near as may be to the Spirit and substance of the Charter, it be recommended to the Provincial Convention to write Letters: to the Inhabitants of the several Places which are intituled to Representation in Assembly requesting them to chuse such Representatives, and that the Assembly, when chosen, do elect Councillors; and that such Assembly and Council exercise the Powers of Government, untill a Governor of his Majestys Appointment will consent to govern the Colony, according to its Charter.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d245n8" id="PJA03d245n8-ptr">8</a></p>
      <p>In Pursuance of which Advice, the good People of this <del title="deleted text">&lt;Province&gt;</del><a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d245n9" id="PJA03d245n9-ptr">9</a> Colony have chosen a full and free Representation of themselves, who, being convened in Assembly have elected a Council, who, <del title="deleted text">&lt;have assumed&gt;</del> as the executive Branch of Government have constituted necessary officers <del title="deleted text">&lt;civil and Military&gt;</del><a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d245n10" id="PJA03d245n10-ptr">10</a> through the Colony. The present Generation, therefore, may be congratulated on the Acquisition of a Form of Government, more immediately in all its Branches under the Influence and Controul of the People, and therefore more free and happy than was <del title="deleted text">&lt;ever&gt;</del><a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d245n11" id="PJA03d245n11-ptr">11</a> enjoyed by their Ancestors. But as a Government so popular can be Supported only by universal Knowledge and Virtue, in the Body of the People, it is the Duty of all Ranks, to promote the Means of Education, for the rising Generation as well as true Religion, Purity of Manners, and Integrity of Life among all orders and Degrees.</p>
      <p>As an Army has become necessary for our Defence, and in all free States the civil must provide for and controul the military Power, the Major Part of the Council have appointed Magistrates and Courts of Justice in every County, <del title="deleted text">&lt;and this Court, giving others&gt;</del> whose Happiness is so connected with that of the People that it is difficult to suppose they can abuse their Trust. The Business of it is to see those Laws inforced which are necessary for the Preservation of Peace, Virtue and <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[good Order.]</span> And the great and general Court expects and requires that all necessary Support and Assistance be given, and all proper Obedience yielded to them, and will deem every Person, who <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0386">[386<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-03/ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0386.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>shall fail of his Duty in this Respect towards them <del title="deleted text">&lt;an Enemy to the Country&gt;</del> a disturber of the peace of this Colony and deserving of <del title="deleted text">&lt;strict and impartial&gt;</del> exemplary Punishment.</p>
      <p>That Piety and Virtue, which alone can Secure the Freedom of any People may be encouraged and Vice and Immorality suppressd, the great and general Court have thought fit to issue this Proclamation, commending and enjoining it upon the good People of this Colony, that they lead sober, religious and peaceable Lives, avoiding all Blasphemies, Contempt of the holy Scriptures and of the Lords Day and all other Crimes and Misdemeanors, all Debauchery, Prophaneness, Corruption Venality all riotous and tumultuous Proceedings and all Immoralities whatever: and that they decently and reverently attend the public Worship of God at all Times acknowledging with <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Gratitude his merciful Interposition in their Behalf, devoutly confiding in Him, as the God of Armies, by whose Favour and Protection alone they may hope for Success, in their present Conflict.]</span></p>

   <p>Initiated by the House on 18 Dec. 1775, this proclamation was intended to be read at the opening of the several County Sessions, for the Purpose of inculcating a general Obedience of the People to the several Magistrates appointed under the present Government of this Colony. For the purpose of preparing a draft as part of a joint committee, James Sullivan, Samuel Phillips Jr., and Maj. Benjamin Ely were named by the House, William Sever and John Winthrop by the Council. Probably because of his position as Chief Justice, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> was chosen on 28 Dec. to take the place of Sever (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts&lt;/i&gt; [[1715-]], Boston, reprinted by the Massachusetts Historical Society, 1919-.

A. 1a, Reel No. 1, Unit 1, p. 405).</p>

       
   <p>The reason for proposing such a proclamation may have been the meeting of two Berkshire co. conventions in Stockbridge on 14 and 15 Dec., which showed that the members of that countys Committee of Correspondence were badly divided over whether to accept judicial officers appointed by the Council. A majority insisted that such officials should be nominated by the people for the Councils consideration, and they declared that they would not recommend that the people support the existing form of government. A counter-convention of the minority drafted resolutions condemning the stand of the majority (Robert J. Taylor, ed., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Massachusetts, Colony to Commonwealth,</span> Chapel Hill, 1961, p. 14, 1617).</p>

       
   <p>In seeking support for the appointees of the Council through a proclamation, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> picked his words with great care and stated his argument in the broadest terms. His first eight paragraphs read more like a preamble to a declaration of independence than a plea for acceptance of appointed magistrates. He even notes that Massachusetts took the milder course of a temporary suspension of government rather than instant Recourse to Arms; in short, that as the Declaration of Independence would later argue, the people chose to suffer as long as evils could be borne rather than abolish the forms of government to which they were accustomed.</p>

       
   <p>The tone of this introduction is quite out of keeping with congressional advice to Massachusetts that it operate as usual, with the office of governor vacant, until a royally appointed governor was willing to abide by the charter. That charter with its provision for royal disallowance did not vest sovereignty in the people. The wholly new government of its own creation that the congress had denied to Massachusetts, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> was here claiming in uncompromising tones despite his quotation of congressional advice. Over two months before, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> had sketched out for Richard Henry Lee some of the specifics he thought essential in any independent government (<abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> to Lee, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-03-02-0163" class="document">15 Nov. 1775</a>, above); he was now helping to ready the minds of the people for that essential step. Yet <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> carefully pointed out that, however free the forms of government might be, freedom depended upon piety, virtue, and knowledgea theme that he was to sound again and again in his <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0388">[388<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-03/ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0388.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>writings. It therefore behooved the people to worship God, eschew immorality, and obey the law as interpreted by Council appointees, who had been named through the system advised by the congress.</p>

   <p>With the royal governor rejected and not likely to be reinstated, the less technical term was preferable, especially to one who did not want the royal governor re-established.
