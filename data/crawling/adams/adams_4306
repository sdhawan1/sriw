Matthew Ridleys diary recorded Stracheys return on the 23d and indicated that Oswald and his colleague, Alleyne Fitzherbert, were very doubtful about Peace and of Ld. Shelburne keeping his Ground. Their apprehensions, which were well founded and shared by their American counterparts, largely concerned Arts. 3, 5, and 6 dealing with the fisheries and the loyalists (see notes 4, 5, and 7).

   <p><abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> believed that, as revised in London, this article was an effort to reconcile American access to the Newfoundland fisheries with any corresponding stipulation to be made in an Anglo-French peace treaty, writing in his Diary that he could not help observing that the Ideas respecting the Fishery appeared to me to come piping hot from Versailles. The practical effect of the change in language would have been to prohibit the Americans from fishing closer than three leagues, or nine miles, from the coast. During a long and detailed explanation of the minutiae of the cod and haddock fisheries and American participation by tradition and treaty, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> noted that the proposed change would have placed American fishermen at a severe disadvantage without securing any benefit for English fishermen. <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> explained that in the springtime cod and haddock came very close to shore, even into the harbors and streams. While American fishermen could get to the fishing grounds early enough to take advantage of this phenomenon, English fishermen could not. Therefore, if Americans were not permitted to operate unrestricted along the coast, no fish would be taken by anyone. On 25 Nov., during the opening stages of his defense of American fishing rights, which continued intermittently on 26, 28, and 29 Nov., <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> noted that we have a saying at Boston that when the Blossoms fall the Haddock begin to crawl, that is, to move out into deep water (same, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-01-03-02-0001-0004-0018%20ADMS-print-01-03-02-0001-0004-0019#ADMS-01-03-02-pb-0072" class="pageNo">3:7281</a>).

   <p>Neither this nor the following article, which together require restitution and amnesty for the loyalists, appear in the treaty signed on 30 November. Nevertheless, they illustrate the gulf dividing the British and American negotiators. What to do about the loyalists was the most contentious issue of the negotiations. As Benjamin Vaughan observed in a 27 Nov. letter to Benjamin Franklin, if you wanted to break off your treaty, I am perfectly sensible that you could not do it on grounds in which America would more join with you, than this of the refugees. On the other hand, if <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">England</span> wanted to break, she could not wish for better ground on <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">her</span> side (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Papers of Benjamin Franklin&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

Cohn, and others, New Haven, 1959. ]">Franklin, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Papers</span></span>, 38:368369). The American Commissioners problem was that Arts. 5 and 6 were less conditional and went further than the provisions in the <span class="pageNo warning">draft treaty of [<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">4 Nov.</span>]</span>, above. Indeed, their inclusion as they appear here indicates the pressure on the Shelburne ministry to do something tangible for the loyalists. This is particularly so in view of the commissioners <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0021" class="document">7 Nov. letter to Richard Oswald</a>, above, in which they declared that, despite Oswalds warning that the ministry in London would consider the <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0009%20ADMS-print-06-14-02-0010#ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0017" class="pageNo">[<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">4 Nov.</span>] drafts</a> provisions regarding the loyalists inadequate, anything beyond what was granted to the loyalists there was <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0089">[89<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-14/ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0089.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>unacceptable to them and impossible for Congress to implement.</p>

                
   <p>Despite the importance of the loyalist issue and its potential to render a peace settlement impossible, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s Diary has relatively little to say about the negotiations over the loyalists. On 26 Nov. he noted that there had been endless Discussions about the Tories and on the 27th that Oswald and the commissioners were endeavouring to come together, concerning the Fisheries and Tories. Only on the 29th does he comment extensively regarding the final British capitulation to the inevitable and the acceptance of the articles appearing in the treaty of 30 Nov., below. <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s reticence probably stems from his more active role and interest in the negotiations over the fisheries; it probably also reflects his deference to Benjamin Franklin, who was very staunch against the Tories, more decided a great deal on this Point than Mr. Jay or my self. Indeed, in his Diary entry for 29 Nov., <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> quotes extensively from the paper that Franklin presented during that days negotiating session, a copy of which is in the <span class="ref-terms">Adams Papers</span> (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Diary and Autobiography of John Adams&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

Franklin threatened that should the British insist on compensation for the loyalist losses in America, the commissioners would require that American citizens be compensated for the destruction and losses caused by British wartime operations.
