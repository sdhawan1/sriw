<p>Treaty of Amity and Commerce, between their High Mightinesses, the States General of the united Netherlands, and the United States of America, to wit New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,<a class="ptr" href="#PJA13d208n2" id="PJA13d208n2-ptr">2</a> and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New-York New Jersey, Pensilvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.</p>
<p>Their High Mightinesses, the States General of the United Netherlands, and the united States of America, to wit New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey Pensilvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, desiring to ascertain, in a permanent and equitable manner, the Rules to be observed, relative to the Commerce, and Correspondence which they intend to establish, between their respective States Countries and Inhabitants, have judged, that the said End cannot be better obtained than by establishing the most perfect Equality and Reciprocity, for the Basis of their Agreement, and by avoiding all those burthensome Preferences, which are usually, the Sources of Debate, Embarrassment and Discontent; by leaving also each Party, at Liberty to make respecting Commerce and Navigation Such ulteriour Regulations, as it shall find most convenient to itself: and by founding the Advantages of Commerce, Solely, upon reciprocal Utility, and the just Rules, of free Intercourse: reserving, withall, to each Party, the Liberty of admitting at its Pleasure, other Nations to a Participation of the same Advantages.</p>

<p>On these Principles, their said High Mightinesses, the States General of the United Netherlands, have named, <del title="deleted text">&lt;Messieurs&gt;</del> for their Plenipotentiaries, from the midst of their Assembly, Messieurs thier Deputies for the foreign Affairs <del title="deleted text">&lt;from the midst of the Assembly of their High Mightinesses,&gt;</del><a class="ptr" href="#PJA13d208n3" id="PJA13d208n3-ptr">3</a> And the said United States of America, on their Part, have furnished with Full Powers, Mr John Adams late Commissioner of the United States of America at the Court of Versailles, heretofore Delegate in Congress from the State of Massachusetts Bay, and Chief Justice of the said State, who have agreed and concluded, as follows, to wit</p>

<div class="ab docsub">Article 6.</div>
<p>The Subjects of the contracting Parties, may, on one Side and on the other, in the respective Countries and States, dispose of their Effects, by Testament, Donation, or otherwise; and their Heirs, Subjects of one of the Parties and residing in the Country of the other, or elsewhere, shall receive Such Successions, even Ab Intestato, whether in Person, or by their Attorney, or Substitute, even although they shall not have obtained Letters of Naturalisation, without having the Effect of such Commission contested under Pretext of any Rights or Praerogatives of any Province, City or private Person: and if the Heirs, to whom such Successions may have fallen, shall be Minors, the Tutors or Curators, established by the Judge Domiciliary of the said Minors, may govern, direct, administer, Sell, and alienate the Effects fallen to the said Minors by Inheritance, and in general, in relation to the said Successions and Effects, Use all the Rights, and fullfill all the Functions, which belong by the Disposition of the Laws to Guardians, Tutors and Curators: provided, nevertheless, that this Disposition cannot take Place, but in Cases where the Testator shall not have named Guardians Tutors or Curators, by Testament, Codicil, or other legal Instrument.</p>

<div class="ab docsub">Article 7.</div>

Much less shall it be permitted to the Subjects of either Party to take, or extort by Force any Thing, from the Subjects of the other Party, without the Consent of the owner: which, however, is not to be understood of Seisures, Detentions and Arrests which Shall be made by the Command and Authority of Justice, and by the ordinary Methods, on Account of Debts or Crimes, in respect whereof, the Proceedings must be, by Way of Law, according to the Forms of Justice.</p>
<div class="ab docsub">Article 9.</div>
<p>It is further agreed and concluded, that it shall be wholly free for all Merchants, Commanders of Ships and other Subjects <del title="deleted text">&lt;of their High Mightinesses&gt;</del><a class="ptr" href="#PJA13d208n9" id="PJA13d208n9-ptr">9</a> and Inhabitants, of the contracting Parties, in every Place Subjected to the Jurisdiction of the two Powers respectively, to manage themselves their own Business: and moreover, as to the Use of Interpreters or Brokers as also in Relation to the Loading or Unloading of their Vessells, and every Thing which has Relation thereto, they shall be, on one side and on the other, considered and treated upon the Footing of <del title="deleted text">&lt;with&gt;</del> natural Subjects, or, at least, upon an Equality with the most favoured Nation.</p>
<div class="ab docsub">Article 10.</div>
<p>The Merchant Ships of either of the Parties, coming from the Port of an Ennemy or from their own or a neutral Port, may navigate freely towards any Port of an Ennemy of the other Ally: They shall be nevertheless held, whenever it shall be required, to exhibit, as well upon the high Seas, as in the Ports, their Sea Letters and other Documents described in the twenty fourth<a class="ptr" href="#PJA13d208n10" id="PJA13d208n10-ptr">10</a> Article, stating expressly, that their Effects are not of the Number of those, which are prohibited as Contrabande; and not having any Contraband goods for an Ennemys Port, they may freely and without Hindrance pursue their Voyage, towards the Port of an Ennemy. Nevertheless, It shall not be required to examine the Papers of Vessells convoyed by Vessells of War, but Credence shall be given to the Word of the officer, who shall conduct the Convoy.</p>
<div class="ab docsub">Article 11.</div>
<p>If by exhibiting, the Sea Letters and other Documents, described more particularly in the Twenty fourth Article of this Treaty, the other Party shall discover there are any of those Sorts of Goods which are declared prohibited and Contrabande, and that they are consigned for a Port, under the Obedience of his Ennemy, it shall not be lawfull to break up the Hatches of such Ships nor to open any Chest, Coffer, Packs, Casks, or other Vessells found therein, or to remove the Smallest Parcell of her Goods, whether the said Vessell belongs to the Subjects of their High Mightinesses, the States General of the united Netherlands, or to the Subjects or Inhabitants of the said United States of America, unless the Lading be brought on Shore, in Presence of the officers of the Court of Admiralty, and an Inventory thereof made, but there shall be no allowance to sell, exchange or alienate the same, untill, after that due and lawfull Proscess, shall have been had, against such prohibited Goods of Contraband, and the Court of Admiralty, by a Sentence pronounced, shall have confiscated the same, Saving always, as well the Ship itself, as any other Goods found therein, which are to be esteemed free and may not be detained on Pretence of their being infected, by the prohibited Goods, much less shall they be confiscated as lawfull Prize. But on the contrary, when by the Visitation, at Land, it shall be found, that there are no Contraband Goods in the Vessell, and it shall not appear by the Papers, that he who has taken and carried in the Vessell, has been able to discover any there, he ought to be condemned in all the Charges, Dammages and Interests of them, which he shall have caused, both to the owners of Vessells, and to the owners and Freighters of Cargoes, with which they shall be loaded, by his Temerity in taking and carrying them in. Declaring most expressly the free Vessells, shall assure the Liberty of the Effects with which they shall be loaded, and that this Liberty shall extend itself equally to the Persons who shall be found in a free Vessell, who may not be taken out of her unless they are Military Men, actually in the Service of an Ennemy.</p>
<div class="ab docsub">Article 12.</div>
<p>On the contrary, it is agreed, that whatever shall be found to be laden, by the Subjects and Inhabitants, of either Party, on any Ship belonging to the Enemies of the other, or to their Subjects, although it be not <del title="deleted text">&lt;be&gt;</del> comprehended under the Sort of prohibited Goods, the whole may be confiscated, in the same manner, as if it belonged to the Ennemy, except, nevertheless, such Effects and Merchandizes as were put on board such Vessel, before the Declaration of War, or in the Space of Six months after it, which Effects shall not be, in any manner Subject to Confiscation, but shall be faithfully, and without delay, restored in nature, to the owners who shall claim them, or cause them to be claimed, before the Confiscation and Sale, as also, their Proceeds, if the Claim could not be made, but in the Space of <del title="deleted text">&lt;Six&gt;</del><a class="ptr" href="#PJA13d208n12" id="PJA13d208n12-ptr">12</a> Eight months, after the Sale, which ought to be publick: provided, nevertheless, that if the said Merchandizes are Contraband, it shall by no means be lawfull, to transport them afterwards to any Port belonging to Ennemies.</p>
<div class="ab docsub">Article 13.</div>
<p>And that more effectual Care may be taken, for the Security of Subjects and People of either Party, that they do not Suffer Molestation, from the Vessells of War or Privateers of the other Party, it shall be forbidden to all Commanders of Vessells of War, and other armed Vessells of the said States General of the United Netherlands, and the said United States of America, as well as to all their Officers, Subjects and People to give any Offence, or do any Damage to those of the other Party; and if they act to the contrary, they shall be, upon the first Complaint, which shall be made of it, being found guilty, after a just Examination, punished by their proper Judges, and, moreover, obliged to make satisfaction for all Damages and Interests thereof, by Reparation under Pain and Obligation of Persons and Goods.</p>
<div class="ab docsub">Article 14.</div>
<p>For further determining of what has been said, all Captains of Privateers, or Fitters out of Vessells armed for War, under Commission, and on Account of private Persons, shall be held, before their Departure, to give Sufficient Caution, before competent Judges, either to be entirely responsable, for the Malversations which they may commit in their Cruises or Voyages, as well as for the Contraventions of their Captains and Officers against the present Treaty, and against the Ordonnances and Edicts which shall be published, in Consequence of and Conformity to it, under Pain of Forfeiture and Nullity of the said Commissions.</p>

<div class="ab docsub">Article 15.</div>
<p>All Vessells and Merchandizes, of whatsoever Nature, which shall be rescued out of the Hands of any Pirates or Robbers <del title="deleted text">&lt;on the High Seas shall be brought&gt;</del><a class="ptr" href="#PJA13d208n13" id="PJA13d208n13-ptr">13</a> navigating the high Seas without requisite Commissions shall be brought into some Port of one of the two States, and deposited in the Hands of the Officers of that Port, in order to be restored entire to the true Proprietor, as soon as due and Sufficient Proofs shall be made concerning the Property thereof.</p>
<div class="ab docsub">Article 16.</div>
<p>If any Ships or Vessells, belonging to either of the Parties, their Subjects or People shall within the Coasts or Dominions of the other, stick upon the Sands, or be wrecked or suffer any other Damage, all friendly Assistance and Relief shall be given to the Persons shipwrecked, or such as shall be in danger thereof; and the Vessells, Effects and Merchandizes, or the Part of them which shall have been saved, or the Proceeds of them, if, being perishable they shall have been Sold, being claimed within a Year and a day, by the Masters or owners, or their Agents or Attorneys, shall be restored; paying only the reasonable Charges, and that which must be paid, in the same Case, for the Salvage, by the proper Subjects of the Country: There shall also be delivered them, Safe Conducts or Passports, for their free and Safe Passage from thence, and to return, each one, to his own Country.</p>
<div class="ab docsub">Article 17.</div>

And in Case, any one judges proper, to express, in the said Documents, the Persons to whom the Effects on board belong, he may do it freely, without however being bound to do it; and the omission of such Expression cannot and ought not to cause a Confiscation.</p>

<div class="ab docsub">Article 26.</div>

   <p>This date is derived from the States Generals resolution of 17 Sept. (No. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-13-02-0162-0013-0002" class="document">X</a>, below), which indicates that the final version of the treaty was given to <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> on 6 September. Except for variations in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, there are virtually no differences between the English text printed here and the treaty signed on 8 October. <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="ADMS-06-13-02-pb-0380">[380]</span>This is not the case with the Dutch text. While the endorsement indicates that it was the last version of the treaty agreed to by the negotiators, and its text, except for variations in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, largely conforms to the treaty signed on 8 Oct., there are differences. Some (see notes 2 and 3) apparently reflect last minute negotiations, but most changes were made to make the Dutch text conform to the treatys English text. The most likely reason for the differences between the two documents may be that since <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> was the American negotiator he knew precisely what he had negotiated and kept a record of the progressive changes to his draft so that when he copied out the final version of the treaty he was able to produce an accurate text. The clerk who copied out the Dutch version of the treaty was most likely not one of the Dutch negotiators and either was given or used incomplete or earlier versions of the agreed-upon articles. In any event, the final Dutch text is included in the notes and is taken from the signed treaty as printed in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

It should also be noted that when a note applies to both the English and the Dutch texts the note number is repeated in both versions, but when it applies to only one of the texts, the number appears only there.</p>

</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#PJA13d208n2-ptr" id="PJA13d208n2">2</a>

   <p>On both the Dutch and the English copies <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> interlined the reference to Providence Plantations. This made the list of state names in the title conform to the list in the preamble and corrected a mistake that <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> had made in his draft.</p>

   <p>Originally both the Dutch and the English texts of this paragraph followed the draft and included the revisions suggested by the Dutch and agreed to by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>. The intent apparently was to include, after Heeren in the Dutch text and Messieurs in the English text, the names of the individual Dutch negotiators. Then, after negotiations were completed, it was decided simply to indicate that the negotiators were the deputies of the States General responsible for foreign affairs and to omit their names. <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> then, after canceling the two passages indicated in the paragraph, interlined the new text, with the exception of the retained Deputies, but the corresponding changes were not made in the Dutch text in the <span class="ref-terms">Adams Papers</span>. In the treaty signed on 8 Oct. the alteration was made, and there the Dutch text reads Op deeze grondbeginzelen, hebben voorgemelde haar Hoog Mogende de Staten Generaal der Vereenigde Nederlanden, tot hunne Plenipotentiarissen, uit het midden hunner Vergadering benoemd, de Heeren derselver Gedeputeerden tot de buitenlandsche Saaken (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

In the treaty of 8 Oct. this and the following paragraphs were combined.</p>

   <p>From this point to the end of the article the Dutch text retained the language of Art. 2 of the draft, which included changes suggested by the Dutch and agreed to by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>. In the treaty signed on 8 Oct., it was revised to read of van eenige vreemde Havenvan de Wereld na eenige van deeze Havens, welke de gemelde Natien reeds genieten of zullen genieten and thereby bring it into agreement with the English text (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

   <p><abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> inadvertantly wrote Islands twice and then presumably underlined the first to indicate that it should be deleted.</p>

</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#PJA13d208n6-ptr" id="PJA13d208n6">6</a>

   <p>In the Dutch text the previous six words were retained from Art. 9 of the draft and included a change proposed by the Dutch and accepted by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>. In the treaty signed on 8 Oct. the passage was replaced by eenige Militaire Expeditie, publicq of privaat to bring it into conformity with the English text (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="default.xqy?expandNote=all&amp;keys=ADMS-print-06-13-02-0162-0011-0001#PJA13d208n8-ptr" id="PJA13d208n8">8</a>

   <p>The passage from the beginning of the paragraph to this point followed the text of Art. 9 of the draft, but in the 8 Oct. treaty it was deleted and replaced with veel minder zal het gepermitteert zyn aan to reflect the change made in the English text. In addition, the paragraph was closed up to gelkende, which was followed by a colon (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#PJA13d208n9-ptr" id="PJA13d208n9">9</a>

   <p>This is an inadvertence. The passage appears in Art. 10 of the draft and, in fact, is an insertion suggested by the Dutch and accepted by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>. There it was followed by a reference to the United States of America. Both references had been removed during the negotiations when it was decided to refer to the contracting parties to the treaty.</p>

</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#PJA13d208n10-ptr" id="PJA13d208n10">10</a>

   <p>In both the Dutch and English texts this and the following article should have referred to Art. 25. The error was corrected in the 8 Oct. treaty (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

   <p>The preceding six words, which followed the text of Art. 11 of the draft as revised by the Dutch and accepted by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>, were deleted and replaced by Goederen voor een <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="ADMS-06-13-02-pb-0381">[381]</span>Vyandelyke Haven gelaaden hebbende, na de Haven van een Vyand to reflect the change made in the English text (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#PJA13d208n12-ptr" id="PJA13d208n12">12</a>

   <p>An inadvertence probably owing to the reference to six months earlier in the article. Eight months was the term given in Art. 13 of the draft as altered by the Dutch and approved by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>, and it is eight months in the Dutch text.</p>

</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#PJA13d208n13-ptr" id="PJA13d208n13">13</a>

   <p>An inadvertence. <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> copied the original language of Art. 15 of the draft rather than the change proposed by the Dutch, accepted by him, and incorporated in the Dutch text.</p>

</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="default.xqy?expandNote=all&amp;keys=ADMS-print-06-13-02-0162-0011-0001#PJA13d208n14-ptr" id="PJA13d208n14">14</a>

   <p>From the previous comma, the Dutch text retained the language of Art. 18 of the draft as altered by the Dutch and accepted by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>. In the treaty signed on 8 Oct., the passage was changed to bring it into accord with the English text and there reads ten minsten indien de Oorlogs-Declaratie niet bekent was geweest (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#PJA13d208n15-ptr" id="PJA13d208n15">15</a>

   <p>At this point the English and Dutch texts agree, but in the Dutch text of the treaty signed on 8 Oct., en was changed to of. That should have made the English text read subjects or inhabitants, but the subjects and inhabitants was retained in the English version (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

   <p>The Dutch text retained the previous three words from Art. 19 of the draft. In the treaty signed on 8 Oct. they were deleted and replaced with Haar Hoog Mogende to bring the English and Dutch texts into agreement (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#PJA13d208n17-ptr" id="PJA13d208n17">17</a>

   <p>An inadvertence. <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> began copying the original language of Art. 20 of the draft, before it had been revised according to the Dutch request agreed to by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>.</p>

</div>

   <p>The preceding eleven words followed the text of Art. 20 of the draft as revised by the Dutch and accepted by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>. In the treaty signed on 8 Oct. they were replaced with minsten indien er geen wettig vermoeden is dat zy aan een Vyand to make it conform to the English text (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#PJA13d208n19-ptr" id="PJA13d208n19">19</a>

   <p>In the margin and keyed to this point in the Dutch text <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> wrote 14. Moet weezen 19. That is, 14 should be 19. The discrepancy between the article numbers referred to here and later in the article (1917 and 2422) is owing to Congress deletion of Arts. 11 and 12 from the ratified treaty of commerce (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#PJA13d208n20-ptr" id="PJA13d208n20">20</a>

   <p>An inadvertence. Although this article was the most controversial in the treaty and underwent numerous changes, the words of commerce or, in Dutch, van commercie appeared at this point in Art. 22 of the draft and in a revised article proposed prior to 22 Aug. (No. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-13-02-0162-0007" class="document">IV</a>, above). It was apparently removed as redundant because of the reference to the treaty of commerce later in the article.</p>

</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#PJA13d208n21-ptr" id="PJA13d208n21">21</a>

   <p>Blank in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript ]">MS</abbr>. In the treaty signed on 8 Oct., it reads Artifices (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed. Hunter Miller, Washington, D.C., 19311948; 8 vols. ]">same</span>, 2:79). The omission of a word here may be owing to a translation problem because the alteration to the text of Art. 25 of the draft that was proposed by the Dutch and accepted by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> contained the same language as in the Dutch text.</p>

   <p>The previous three words followed the text of Art. 26 of the draft, but in the treaty signed on 8 Oct. they were deleted to make the passage conform to the English text (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

   <p>Blank in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript ]">MS</abbr>. It is unclear why <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> wrote which and then left a blank rather than outward bound, the words appearing in Art. 26 of the draft, which were proposed by the Dutch, accepted by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>, and included in the treaty signed on 8 Oct. (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

   <p>The previous five words followed the text of Art. 29 of the draft as revised by the Dutch and accepted by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>.

   <p>The Dutch text followed that of Art. 29 of the draft as revised by the Dutch and approved by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>, but in the treaty signed on 8 Oct. the word niet (not) was inserted to make the passage conform to the English text (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

   <p>In both the Dutch and English texts of the treaty signed on 8 Oct. this passage was deleted. In the Dutch text it was replaced by In den Hage den Agtsten October, Een duysent Seeven hondert twee en tagtig and is followed by the seals and names of the Dutch plenipotentiaries: George van Randwyck, Bartholomeus van den Santheuvel, Pieter van Bleiswyck, Willem Carel Hendrik van Lynden van Blitterswyck, Derk Jan van Heeckeren van Brandsenburg, Joan van Kuffeler, Frederick Gysbert van Dedem tot den Gelder, and Herman Tjassens.
