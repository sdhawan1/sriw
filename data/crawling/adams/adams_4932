          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Whereas Instructions bearing date the 29<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">th.</span> day of October 1783 were sent to the Ministers Plenipotentiary of the United States of America at the Court of Versailles empowered to Negotiate A Peace or to any one or more of them for concerting Draughts or Propositions for Treaties of Amity and Commerce with the Commercial Powers of Europe<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-16-02-0105-fn-0002" id="ADMS-06-16-02-0105-fn-0002-ptr">2</a></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Resolved That it will be advantageous to these United States to conclude such Treaties with Russia, the Court of Vienna, Prussia, Denmark, Saxony, Hamburg, Great Britain, Spain, Portugal, Genoa, Tuscany, Rome, Naples, Venice, Sardinia and the Ottoman Porte.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Resolved that in the formation of these Treaties the following points be carefully stipulated.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">First That each Party shall have a right to carry their own Produce, Manufactures and Merchandize in their own bottoms to the Ports of the other, and thence to take the Produce and Merchandize of the other, paying in both Cases such duties only as are paid by the most favoured Nation, freely where it is freely granted to such Nation, or paying the Compensation, where such Nation does the same</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Second. That with the Nations holding Territorial Possessions in America a direct and similar Intercourse be admitted between the United States and such Possessions; or if this cannot be obtained, then a direct and similar intercourse between the United States and certain free Ports within such Possessions; that if this neither can be obtained, permission be stipulated to bring from such Possessions in their own bottoms the Produce and Merchandize thereof to these States directly and for these States to carry in their own bottoms their Produce and Merchandize to such Possessions directly</p>
          <span class="pb center" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-16-02-pb-0194">[194<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-16/ADMS-06-16-02-pb-0194.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Third. That these United States be considered in all such treaties, and in every Case arising under them, as one Nation upon the Principles of the Fderal Constitution.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-16-02-0105-fn-0003" id="ADMS-06-16-02-0105-fn-0003-ptr">3</a></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Fourth. That it be proposed, though not indispensibly required, that if War should hereafter arise between the two Contracting Parties, the Merchants of either Country then residing in the other shall be allowed to remain nine Months to collect their Debts and settle their Affairs, and may depart freely, carrying off all their effects without molestation or hindrance; And all Fishermen, all Cultivators of the Earth and all Artizans or Manufacturers unarmed and inhabiting unfortified towns, Villages or Places, who labour for the common subsistence and benefit of Mankind, and peaceably following their respective employments, shall be allowed to continue the same, And shall not be molested by the Armed force of the Enemy, in whose power by the Events of War they may happen to fall; but if any thing is necessary to be taken from them for the use of such Armed force, the same shall be paid for at a reasonable Price; and all Merchants and Traders exchanging the Products of different Places, and thereby rendering the necessaries conveniences and comforts of human life more easy to obtain and more General, shall be allowed to pass free and unmolested, and neither of the contracting powers shall grant or issue any Commission to any private Armed Vessels empowering them to take or destroy such trading Ships or interrupt such Commerce.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-16-02-0105-fn-0004" id="ADMS-06-16-02-0105-fn-0004-ptr">4</a></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Fifth. And in case either of the Contracting Parties shall happen to be engaged in War with any other Nation, it be farther agreed in order to prevent all the difficulties and misunderstandings that usually arise respecting the Merchandize heretofore called Contraband, such as Arms Ammunition and Military Stores of all kinds, that no such Articles carrying by the ships or Subjects of one of the Parties to the Enemies of the other shall on any account be deemed contraband, so as to induce confiscation and a loss of Property to individuals, Nevertheless it shall be lawful to stop such Ships &amp; to detain them for such length of time as the Captors may think necessary to prevent the inconvenience or damage that might ensue from their proceeding on their Voyage, paying however a reasonable Compensation for the loss such arrest shall occasion to the Propietors; and it shall be further allowed to use in the service of the Captors the whole or any part of the Military Stores so detained, paying the owners the full Value of the same, to be asscertained by the current Price at the place of its destination: But if the other
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-16-02-pb-0195">[195<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-16/ADMS-06-16-02-pb-0195.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>
contracting party will not consent to discontinue the confiscation of contraband goods, then that it be Stipulated that if the Master of the Vessell stopped will deliver out the goods charged to be contraband, he shall be admitted to do it, and the Vessell shall not in that case be carried into any port but shall be allowed to proceed on her voyage.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-16-02-0105-fn-0005" id="ADMS-06-16-02-0105-fn-0005-ptr">5</a></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Sixth. That in the same case where either of the contracting parties shall happen to be engaged in War with any other Power, all goods not Contraband belonging to the Subjects of that other Power and shipped in the bottoms of the Party hereto, who is not engaged in the War, shall be entirely free; and that to ascertain what shall constitute the blockade of any place or port, it shall be understood to be in such Predicament, when the assailing power shall have taken such a station as to expose to imminent danger any Ship or Ships that would attempt to sail in or out of the said Port; and that no Vessell of the Party, who is not engaged in the said War shall be stopped without a material and well grounded cause; and in such cases justice shall be done and an Indemnification given without loss of time to the Persons aggrieved and thus stopped without sufficient cause</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Seventh.</span> That no rights be stipulated for aliens to hold real property within these States, this being utterly inadmissible by their several laws and Policy; but where on the death of any person holding real estate within the territories of one of the contracting parties, such real estate would by their laws descend on a subject or citizen of the other, were he not disqualified by alienage, there he shall be allowed a reasonable time to dispose of the same and with draw the proceeds without molestation.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-16-02-0105-fn-0006" id="ADMS-06-16-02-0105-fn-0006-ptr">6</a></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Eighth. That such treaties be made for a term not exceeding ten years from the exchange of Ratification</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Ninth. That these Instructions be considered as supplementary to those of October 29. 1783 and not as revoking, except where they contradict them. That where in Treaty with a particular Nation they can procure particular Advantages, to the Specification of which we have been unable to descend, our object in those Instructions having been to form out-Lines only and general Principles with many Nations, it is our Expectation they will procure them, though not pointed out in these Instructions; and where they may be able to form Treaties on Principles, which in their Judgment will be more beneficial to the United States than those herein directed to be made their Basis, they are permitted to adopt such Principles. That as to the Duration of the Treaties, though we have proposed to

restrain them to the Term of 10 years, yet they are at liberty to extend the same as far as fifteen years with any Nation, which may pertinaciously insist thereon; and that it will be agreeable to us to have supplementary Treaties with France, the United Netherlands and Sweden, which may bring the Treaties we have entered into with them as nearly as may be to the Principles of those now directed; but that this be not pressed, if the proposal should be found disagreable.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Resolved, That Treaties of Amity and Commerce be entered into with Morocco and the Regencies of Algiers, Tunis and Tripoly to continue for the same Term of 10 years or for a Term as much longer as can be procured.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">That our Ministers to be commissioned for treating with foreign Nations make known to the Emperor of Morocco the great Satisfaction which Congress feel from the amicable Disposition he has shewn towards these States and his Readiness to enter into Alliance with them; that the Occupations of the War and Distance of our Situation have prevented our meeting his Friendship so early as we wished: But that Powers are now delegated to them for entering into Treaty with him, in the Execution of which they are ready to proceed. And that as to the Expences of his Minister they do therein what is for the Honour and Interest of the United States.</p>

The nuncio indicated that previously the Roman Catholic Church in America had been directed from London, but that in view of the independence of the United States it was proposed to appoint either a bishop with the powers of apostolic vicar or simply an apostolic prefect. Congress was requested to consent to such an appointment by the church. Franklin enclosed the note with his 13 Sept. letter to the president of Congress

   <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">In 1779 Forster Frres, a Bordeaux mercantile firm, obtained a passport from the French government to send a cargo of Bordeaux wine and brandy to Ireland in the Irish ship <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Three Friends.</span> Soon after it sailed it encountered the American frigate <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Alliance,</span> Capt. Pierre Landais, then part of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Bonhomme Richard</span> expedition under the command of John Paul Jones. The <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Alliance</span> took the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Three Friends</span> as a prize and sent it into Lorient, where the vessel and its cargo were alternately plundered and neglected. Although the Forsters obtained a decree under French royal authority not only ordering the return of the prize but also awarding damages and interest, the proceeds from the sale of the ship and its contents fell far short of the firms losses by some <img class="char" src="images/char-lt-trans.png" alt="[livre tournois]"/>169,0000. The Forsters wrote to Vergennes on 28 June 1783, enclosing a petition to Louis XVI in which they requested the kings intervention in obtaining compensation for their loss. Vergennes wrote to Franklin on 29 July, enclosing the Forsters letter and petition and requesting that Congress provide the restitution demanded. Franklin enclosed those documents with his 13 Sept. letter to the president of Congress (<span class="ref-terms" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;expan&gt;Papers of the Continental Congress.

   <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">At issue was whether the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Bonhomme Richard</span> expedition had been a French enterprise or one undertaken under the aegis of the United States. Since all of the vessels in the expedition, with the exception of the frigate <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Alliance,</span> were supplied and outfitted by France, Congress, as these instructions indicate, took the position that it was a French expedition, and, therefore, the prize money and any damages stemming from the actions of those participating in it were the responsibility of France. Indeed the distribution of prize money from the 1779 expedition by Jacques Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont, the French agent for its outfitting, was an issue that Congress had taken up in its fourth instruction of 29 Oct. 1783. It was not resolved until 1787, and then by Jones as Congress agent (vol. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-15-02-0163#ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0332" class="pageNo">15:332</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-15-02-0163%20ADMS-print-06-15-02-0164#ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0334" class="pageNo">334</a>).

   <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Vergennes wrote to Franklin on 5 Aug. 1783, enclosing a memorial from Franois Louis Bayard, a French merchant and shipowner, which Vergennes thought had some merit.

The third, which Congress paraphrased from its English translation of Bayards memorial, concerned the continental currencys depreciation. Bayard argued that as a Frenchman he should be reimbursed at the currencys value when Joseph de Valnais, French consul at Boston, made his deposit in continental dollars in consequence of litigation over his irregular sale of one of Bayards vessels.
