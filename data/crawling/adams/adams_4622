The brains were for providing that persons taken up as such, should have a trial by jury to determine whether they came under the description in the act of 1778; the tongues determined that the matter should be left to the determination of two justices, &amp; in case these judged them guilty, the Governor was to transport them. The voters were a hundred one way, &amp; thirty the other. The latter are likely to publish a spirited sensible protest, if they prosecute what was proposed the last thursday.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0035-fn-0003" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0035-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> M<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">r</span> Sullivan who enjoys his seat unconstitutionally is the dux gregis:<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0035-fn-0004" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0035-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> &amp; I shall not be surprised, after what I have heard, should he manage the ignoramuss, of whom there is <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">not</span> a precious few, &amp; lead them into a violation of the articles of peace, by pleading that no more confiscations means <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">not</span> that no more property shall be confiscated upon the acts already made; but that no more <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">confiscating-acts</span> shall be made.

            <p>We have not yet brought the Harvard College treasurer chosen in 1773 to settle his accounts. He is now hard pressed, but some think he will still contrive to postpone the business. On May the 6<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">th</span> when we had our semi-annual meeting, it was voted unanimously that upon the day to which this meeting shall be adjourned this board will come to a final resolution respecting the measures necessary to effect a settlement of the late treasurers accounts in case they shall not be then settled, &amp; that the secretary be &amp; is hereby directed to furnish him with a copy of this vote.

He met us at the adjournment, pleaded his having been ill &amp; gave us more promises, that he hoped to be well enough, in seven or eight days to finish it, &amp; if so should certainly do it. I considered his presence as designed to prevent freedom of speech; was jealous before I went that he would manoeuvre in that way; &amp; was resolved to speak, told him how long we had been trifled with, that he had been giving us nothing but promises &amp;c &amp;c, &amp; then declared I should make a motion whether seconded or not, &amp; accordingly moved that the Corporation should be advised to sue himno second After that made another motionno second. (The corporation thought I had given him such a lecture, ie one &amp; another of them, that if he would not settle after that they should despair). At length we adjourned for a fortnight. The fortnight was out last tuesday: he had been ill, &amp; we adjourned for another fortnight. I gave hints about publishing the whole history of the affair if it was needful: this may possibly make him afraid of delaying much longer, lest a publication should discover him to the world.

            <p>The Roxbury Instructions were chiefly manufactured by Selden the introduction, the last period of the paragraph about refugees, &amp; the closing paragraph by others. After much debate I lowered the tone designed to have been used, by the violent men, about the refugees, to its present form.

            <p>We begin to feel the scarcity of money. Having no exports, &amp; buying goods drains off our cash. Many adventurers will be greatly disappointed in their hopes of gain. Vessels from Sweden Denmark &amp;c will not carry away good reports when they return. We have not sufficient materials wherewith to freight them. It will take time to procure the same.</p>

Should they mean ill, they will most probably labour, that Congress may at length possess imperial power, that so they may have to purchase them at an easier price than a strong party in every state, a la mode de Sweden, which they possess, now the king has been made arbitrary, at a less cost than before.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0035-fn-0015" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0035-fn-0015-ptr">15</a></p>
            <p>The Southern gentry are going back to their aristocratic or monarchical principles. They never were genuine sons of Liberty, they were sons only occasionally &amp; by accident.

The matter was not settled when I left town about five.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0035-fn-0019" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0035-fn-0019-ptr">19</a> Can scarce think that Danielson will carry his point. Should he, it must alarm all kind of creditors, &amp; lead them to fear that sooner or later, there may be a general court, that will venture to spunge our all debts.</p>

   <p>In 1778 the General Court adopted An act to prevent the return to this state, of certain persons therein named, and others, who have left this state, or either of the United States, and joined the enemies thereof (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Acts and Resolves, Public and Private, of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay&lt;/i&gt;, Boston, 18691922; 21 vols. ]">Mass., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Province Laws</span></span>, 5:912918). It provided that if people proscribed in the act returned to Massachusetts they were to be apprehended by local authoritiesselectmen, committees of correspondence, etc.; taken before a justice of the peace, who would order them jailed; and then transported from the state by the provincial Board of War. But in 1783 the Board of War did not exist, and thus there was no entity empowered to transport a proscribed returnee. This led the Mass. house of representatives, on 25 June, to adopt a revised law to remedy the situation. The new act provided that in case any person now stands committed by any Magistrate, or hereafter shall be committed to any goal in this Commonwealth, by two Justices of the Peace, in pursuance of the act aforesaid, such Magistrate or Justices shall immediately certify the same commitment to the Governor of the Commonwealth, who shall immediately, or as soon as may be, at the expence of the Commonwealth, cause such person so committed, to be transported to some part or place within the dominions of the King of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Great Britain</span>. Gordons objection, as well as that of the 25 members of the house of representatives who entered their dissent, centered on the fact that under the original law and its revision the proscribed person was to be imprisoned and transported without any right to a jury trial (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Acts and Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts&lt;/i&gt; [[17801805]], Boston, 18901898; 13 vols. ]">Mass., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Acts and Laws</span></span>, 17821783, p. 499500; Mass. House, Journals, Records of the States, Microfilm, Mass., A.1b, Reel 11, Unit 1, p. 112118). While that might have been appropriate in 1778, the commonwealth in 1783 was subject to the Constitution of 1780, wherein Art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights provided that no subject shall be arrested, imprisoned, despoiled, or deprived of his property, immunities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or estate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land. And the legislature shall not make any law, that shall subject any person to a capital or infamous punishment, excepting for the government of the army and navy, without trial by jury.</p>

   <p>The article signed Selden in the Boston <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Independent Chronicle</span> of 26 June 1783 was a reply to one from Grotius that had appeared in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Boston Gazette</span> of 3 February. Gordons reference to the article here and his later mention of the role of Selden in the Roxbury instructions (see note 11) makes it likely that Gordon was the author. The Grotius article, possibly by James Sullivan, opposed the impost requested by Congress because the right to levy it had not been specifically granted to Congress under the Articles of Confederation, and Art. IV of the Declaration of Rights in the Mass. Constitution of 1780 specifically stated that The people of this commonwealth have the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves, as a free, sovereign, and independent state; and do, and forever hereafter shall, exercise and enjoy every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not, or may not hereafter, be by them expressly delegated to the United States of America in Congress assembled. Selden called upon Grotius, if he held the Mass. constitution in such reverence, to do honour to your <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">integrity</span> by applying these maxims to the case of James Sullivan, Esq., and he quoted the relevant passage of the constitution regarding residency requirements. A second article signed Selden, also addressed to Grotius, appeared in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Independent Chronicle</span> of 21 Aug. and again took Grotius to task over his devotion to the Mass. constitution.</p>

   <p>Almost from the moment of his appointment as Harvards treasurer, John Hancock was at odds with the Board of Overseers over the performance of his duties and custody of the colleges financial records. Gordons proposal in 1783 that the overseers sue the treasurer was not adopted, but it prompted Hancock to remove from Harvard two students whose educations he was financing and send them to Yale. The records were still being sought at Hancocks death in 1793, and Harvard did not regain custody of the final volume until 1936 (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Langdon Sibley, Clifford K.

   <p>The Roxbury instructions, intended to guide its representative at the next session of the General Court to begin in June, were adopted on 19 May and addressed to Thomas Clarke (Boston <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Independent Chronicle</span>, 29 May). Like the Selden articles (see note 6), the instructions emphasized the need to observe the provisions of the Mass. constitution, and, in particular, Clarke was to guard against the least breach of it in the House of Assembly by the introduct[ion o]r continuance of all unqualified [represe]ntatives. This is significant because it was Clarke who moved to consider James Sullivans qualifications as Bostons representative (<a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-15-02-0028" class="document">from James Warren, 24 June</a>, note 5, above). The paragraph on refugees ended by instructing Clarke to use your influence, that the absentees do not return, and the final paragraph concerned the militia. The instructions also declared that we heartily bless God, that the war has terminated so honorably and advantageously; and take this opportunity of certifying our gratitude to our American Negociators.</p>
