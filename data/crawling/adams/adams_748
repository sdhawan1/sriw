It is likewise agreed, that Such Ships being laden, are to be provided, not only with Passports as above mentioned, but also with Certificates containing the Several Particulars of the Cargo, the Place whence the Ship Sailed, and whither she is bound; that So it may be known whether any forbidden or Contraband Goods, be on board the Same; which Certificates Shall be made out by the Officers of the Place whence the Ship Set Sail, in the accustomed Form.

   <p>The docketing may be somewhat misleading. The committees report was read to the congress on 18 July and tabled, but two days later was ordered to be printed for the use of the members during debate over its final form. The substantial difference between the printed version (<a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-04-02-0116-0003" class="document">No. II</a>, below) and the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ draft ]">Dft</abbr> makes it unlikely that it was this <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ draft ]">Dft</abbr> that was read on 18 July. No evidence has been found that changes in phrasing were made between the reading of the report and the order for printing. Two additional considerations seem to support this supposition: when the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ draft ]">Dft</abbr> was discussed in committee, changes were made which subsequently appeared in the printed version but not on the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ draft ]">Dft</abbr>; it is unlikely that a report containing so many cancellations and additions would have been presented to the congress without being recopied. It may be that the report of the committee was not returned by the printer, a not unusual circumstance, leaving <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ draft ]">Dft</abbr> as the only original approximating the final report and as such placed among the papers of the congress.</p>

The first step in the editorial process was the comparison of the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ draft ]">Dft</abbr> with the committees printed report, on which Charles Thomson recorded all changes made during the debate. This comparison made possible the removal of the majority of the additions and deletions jotted down by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>. The next step was to determine the changes made by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> before he presented his <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ draft ]">Dft</abbr>. <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-04-02-pb-0277">[277<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-04/ADMS-06-04-02-pb-0277.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>These were relatively easy to identify when his strikeouts were made necessary by overzealous copying from his sources, as in Articles 16, 17, 19, and 29. All such changes have been annotated. The remaining alterations, and there are not many, could have been made by either <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> or the committee. The lack of any other copy of the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ draft ]">Dft</abbr> or committee report known to us makes determination impossible. When they involve several words or are significant, these changes have been annotated. In any case, all recorded changes that were not the result of congressional debate have been included in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ draft ]">Dft</abbr> as here printed, deletions appearing, as usual, in italics within angled brackets and additions within double parentheses.

   <p>In the margin opposite the opening lines appears this notation: Coll. of State Tracts 109. Coll of Sea Laws 541. These references are to <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">A Collection of State Tracts</span> and to Justice, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">A General Treatise of the Dominion of the Sea</span> (both fully cited in the <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-04-02-0116-0001" class="document">Editorial Note</a>, above). <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">State Tracts</span>, p. 109, contains the first four articles and part of the fifth of the Treaty of Reswick, concluded between Great Britain and France on 20 Sept. 1697. Art. I contains much of the phrasing used in the preamble to the treaty plan, and it is probable that <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> referred to it to obtain the proper form to use in referring to Louis XVI. Compare the phrase the most Serene and Mighty Prince Lewis the Fourteenth the most Christian King and that used in the treaty plan. On p. 541 of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Sea Laws</span> is Art. I of the Treaty of Peace and Union concluded between Oliver Cromwell and the United Provinces of the Low Countries in 1654, which was probably similarly used by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> as a guide for the preamble to the draft.</p>
