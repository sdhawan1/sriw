          <p>I should have done myself the Pleasure of writing to you before this Time; But since Joining Congress, we have been in an unsettled Posture. little other Business has been done than that of determining a Place, or Places, for the future Residence of Congress. The Discussion of these Questions brot into view many others, of great Importance. The Decissions of Congress, you are undoubtedly acquainted with, respecting their future Residences. But you may probably be uninformd, as to the Motives &amp; Reasons, that operated in the Minds of the Delegates of several of the States, to agree to Measures, that seem to be attended with no inconsiderable Inconveniency on several Accounts. They are such, as have made the Measure unpopular to all those, who are not capable of discerning the absolute Necessity of placing Congress in a Situation, that will have the greatest Tendency to make them a free &amp; independent Body&amp; it is more especially disagreeable to those who have long had a settled Plan of placing Congress in a Situation, where it would be morally impossible that they should not be fettered &amp; shackled with an Influence, that would absolutely controul all their Measures.</p>
          <p>The Simplicity of the first Class, will operate powerfully in Support of the second, who, possessd of no small Share of Cunning &amp; Address, will use all their Endeavors to keep out of Sight, the true Reasons of the Measure, &amp; at the same Time place it in such a Point of Light, as to create strong Prejudices against it in the Minds of the uninformed &amp; unthinking Part of the Society, who are too apt, for the Sake of a little present Relief, to reject Plans that would have a Tendency to secure to them very great future Advantages.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0002" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0002-ptr">2</a></p>
          <p>When Ignorance &amp; Cunning are combined, as is frequently the Case, against wise &amp; politic Measures, hard is the Task of the Man, who is honestly endeavoring to oppose the Systematical Intrigue of a few, by Reasons of public Utility &amp; Propriety. This may be the Situation of those Members of Congress, who have supported the Propositions for two permanent Places, at which the Residence of Congress shall be alternately equal. The Objections against it are easily adduced, &amp; of such a Nature as will at once make sensible Impressions upon the Popular Party: or rather those who do not look beyond the present Day, nor consider the Necessity of securing <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0399">[399<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-15/ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0399.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>to Posterity the Blessings which are at their Disposal. There are several Weighty Reasons to support the late Decissions of Congress. It was necessary to accommodate the several Parts of the Continent, some of which were greatly agitated, &amp; dissatisfied with the first Determination of Congress. It was necessary in Order to destroy Systems, which would finally have ended in absolute Aristocracythe Effects of which have been too apparent for several Years past It would not have been possible, that Congress should ever have been a free &amp; independent Body in the City of Pa. Plans for absolute Government, for deceiving the lower Classes of People, for introducing undue Influence, for any Kind of Government, in which Democracy has the least possible Share, originate, are cherished &amp; disseminated from thence.</p>
          <p>With Respect to accommodating the several States in the Union, it is a Matter of absolute Necessity. The seven eastern States may, by the Iron Hand of voting, carry the Seat of Congress much more Northward than it really ought to be, &amp; accommodate themselves very well But it is unnatural to suppose that the southern States would chearfully submit to such a Decission; they openly declare that they cannot, &amp; will not; &amp; as a fderal Town cannot be erected without their Concurrence; the final Event must have been, that Congress would have again fallen into the City of Pa, &amp; there remained, until the several States for Want of Confidence in them, should have voluntarily put an End to their Existence; which, without pretending to have the Gift of Prophesying, one might easily foresee would not be a very distant Period. As to the Matter of travelling one or two hundred Miles farther, it is of no WeightThe Climate has someBut if Congress can dispatch all their Business in the Fall &amp; Winter, which they certainly may do in future, our pointed Objection against a southern Climate will not exist at those Seasons of the year. I am therefore fully of the Opinion that public Harmony &amp; Concord are Objects of no small Consequence in the Union &amp; that private Inconvenience ought always to give Way to them.</p>
          <p>That Systems of Intrigue &amp; Influence have been laid, that they are too strongly rooted already, is but too well known to those who have had a Share in public Business for these several Years past. A Recital of the various Measures &amp; Manuvres, that tend to corroborate the Opinion, would be too tedious for a Letter I need only say, that the sensible Part of those who are deeply engaged in the intriguing Plans, are most violent against the Decission of <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0400">[400<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-15/ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0400.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>Congress, respecting two Places of Residence, that they have ever since, had strongly marked in their Countenances, an evident Air of Dejection. their unexpected disappointment seems to have irritated them much, &amp; we must be prepared to meet a Torrent of Abuse &amp; many scurrilous Observations. The Prostitutes to Influence are capable frequently of making the wrong seem to be Right But with a Jealous, well informed People, Truth will prevail; &amp; there is little Danger of their condemning honest, well meant Endeavors to serve them.</p>
          <p>The System of Influence began, when the United States were reduced to the most deplorable Situation, on Account of their Finances; when the virtuous Spirit of the People began to Subside, &amp; when among many an Indifference to the Cause began to be too manifest At this fatal Moment the eagle eyed Politican of our great Ally, discovered the absolute Importance of the Aid of his Master, &amp; the critical Situation of the United States.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0003" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> It was then he ventured to propose that Congress should subject their Peace Commissioners to the absolute controul of a foreign Court. It was then found to be necessary to establish Ministers of State, a Financier, a Secretary at War, &amp; a Secre[tary] for foreign Affairs. It was necessary to place Congress in a Situation before the Close of the War that the Members of that Body, excepting a chosen few, should know little or nothing of the Negociations abroad It was necessary to create an Office of foreign Affairs, &amp; that the Chevalier &amp; his Secretary should be the Persons behind the Scene to manage &amp; direct all the Measures t[here]of. In the Beginning of the year 1781 Congress found themselves extremely embarassdthey had no Money, nor any Creditthe southern States were some of them abandonned to, &amp; others of them overrun by the Enemy The Delegates from those States found it impractible for the eastern States to afford them much Assistance; &amp; some from Despair of other Means, &amp; others probably from less virtuous Motives, agreed to give up the united States to foreign Power, perswading themselves &amp; endeavoring to perswade others, that disinterested Benevolence alone, was the Principle from which that Court always acted. All Hommage was due &amp; it became Treason to speak, think or even look, as if one supposd it possible that she should do us an Injury, or act from interested Motives. The Weakness &amp; the Wickedness of the southern States placed the united States in a most humiliating Situation, opend the Door of Intrigue, which has been disclosing more &amp; more every Year since I have no Doubt their Object was to <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0401">[401<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-15/ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0401.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>s[erve] their own Country; &amp; for this Purpose, they became humble devo[ted] Worshippers of the golden Imageand every Person that did not flatter, &amp; dance attendance as much as they, was immediately set down as having a contracted, illiberal Mind.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0004" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> Attention and a smile elated the one Party, whilst a cold formal Reception &amp; often a pointed Neglect, markd evidently the point of Light in which the other was viewed.</p>
          <p>In this Situation was Congress, when the great Officers of State commenced The Financier &amp; Secretary for foreign Affairs were admirably well adapted to support, &amp; not only so, but to become the principal Engines of Intrigue The first mentioned Officer, is a Man of inflexible Perseverance He Judges well in almost all Money Matters; &amp; mercantile Transactions He well knows what is necessary to support public Credit But never thinks it necessary to secure the Confidence of the People, by making Measures palatable to them A Man destitute of every Kind of theoretic Knowledge; but from extensive mercantile Negociations, he is a good practical Merchant; more than this cannot be said with Justice. He Judges generally for himself; &amp; acts with great Decision He has many excellent Qualities for a Financier, which however do not comport so well with Republicanism, as Monarchy. Ambitious of becoming the first Man in the united States, he was not so delicate in the Choice of Means, &amp; Men for his Purpose, as is indispensably necessary in a free Government The good Ally of the United States could assist him in Money, &amp; he was heartily disposd to make her very grateful Returns The United States abound with Men absolutely devoted. With such a Financier and with such Materials, it is easy to conceive what an amazing Power he would soon acquire. He stood in need of foreign Support, &amp; <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">they</span> stood in need of him; thus far the political Machinery was in Unison; &amp; republicanism grated harsh Discords.</p>
          <p>The Secretary for foreign Affairs was a Man of more acquired Knowledge, &amp; less natural AbilityA Person as completely devoted to promote all the Views &amp; Wishes of our good Ally, as his Minister &amp; Secretary could possibly be. His Office was mestireous, &amp; secret to all those, who ought to have a perfect Knowledge of all it containd It was undoubtedly public to all those, to whom it ought to have been a profound Secret Two foreigners were private Secretaries in that Office; one of which it is probable was <del class="line-through" title="deleted in MS">a Disciple of the Sorbonne</del> educated a Jesuitthe other had been a french Priest.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0005" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> With this Arrangement, it is impossible to suppose that any Thing of <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0402">[402<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-15/ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0402.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>Importance, would not be communicated immediately to such as the Interest of the united States required, should not know it. More real Injury resulted from this Arrangement, than could possibly have done, if there had been no Office &amp; no pretended Secrets. It was a Snare to our faithful foreign Ministers, &amp; a secure Asylum, to such as were disposd to prostrate the Honor &amp; Dignity of the United States, before the polluted Shrine of Monarchy. In this Situation it was impossible to support an honest Man; All our foreign Ministers, excepting one, have felt very severely the Effects of this unaccountable System. It is strange that so many, who seem to be republicans, were so easily drawn into the Snare, &amp; that they either could not, or would not see, that it was giving up at once, all the Priviledges for the Preservation of which we had freely lavishd our Blood &amp; Treasure.</p>
          <p>It was fortunate for the United States, that the Secretary at War, was a true Republican, &amp; totally opposd to Intrigue &amp; aristocratical Measureshad Gen<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">l</span>. Schuyler, who nearly carried the Choice, been placd in that Office, It is a great Question in my Mind, whether it would have been practicable for Congress, to have disbanded their Army.<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0006" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0006-ptr">6</a> The Financier only wanted a Person in that Office who would go any Lengths with him: a Number of Officers as well as Citizens were ripe for the Measure It had undoubtedly been deliberately digestedAnd the Finance Office was probably the Center of Motion. I am well informed that an Attempt was made to draw in the late Secretary at WarBut he checkd it, with a Firmness, that will always do him Honor. such a Triumvirate, would have been too powerful for the United States; &amp; Heaven only knows what Kind of a Form our fderal Government would have assumd. The present, by that Party, is held in the utmost Detestation, &amp; they will persevere inflexibly in their Attempts for any Alteration, by Intrigue, &amp; by open Force, when Matters are matured, &amp; promise more Success, than at present.</p>
          <p>These Plans, in which our good Allies, were undoubtedly more than idle Spectators, originated in the Beginning of the Year 1781 &amp; operated fully before the End of the Year.</p>
          <p>Having given you a general View of the prevailing politics of Congress at that Time, I hope it will not be altogether useless to communicate to you, as far as my Memory serves me, The Reasons that were urged in Support of several important Decissions of Congress respecting our foreign Ministers.

I find the Committee reported to Congress several Amendments proposd by him, the most material of which was and you are ultimately to govern yourself by the Advice of the Minister of his most Christian Majesty. &amp;ca The Amendments were all said to be carried in the affirmative; the yeas &amp; nays on the above Clause, shew that there were but Eight States in Favor of it And it has always been a Question whether the Instructions were valid, as nine States never agreed to them &amp; the Confederation requires the Assent of nine States, on all Questions relating to Treaties. But it was not sufficient to let it rest here; A Treaty of Peace was a very important Matter to the united States; too much so, to be committed to any Individual. Two great Objects in that Treaty, would be, the Fishery &amp; western Territory: &amp; local Views might operate too powerfully in the Mind of a single Person: He would certainly urge that most, which would be most beneficial to the Part of the Continent from which he might happen to be taken. The Ultimata with Respect to the Limits of the united States agreed upon in 1778 or 1779 being repeated,<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0008" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0008-ptr">8</a> there was some Reason, why there should be more than one Peace Commissioner, Indeed there would have been a very good Reason for it, considering the general Terms of the last Instructions, had not that humiliating Clause been inserted, which made all our Peace Commissioners a mere Cypher.

That there were no more, I am sure as an Individual, having the Names of the Persons who were willing to submit their dearest Interests to Judges deeply concernd in the Decision. It was objected at the Time, that Eight States were not competent to pass such Instructions &amp; that the Articles of Confederation invested no Power in Congress by which they could make a foreign Court the Arbiter of Peace [&amp;] War for the united States. I have as yet no Reason to alter my Opinion, which is, that both were unconstitutional. To make War nine States are necessary: but the Confederation is not as explicit respecting the making of Peace It is held by some, that seven States only are necessary&amp; some who assisted in framing the Confederation, say, that this was the Idea of the Framers But an Idea so replete with Inconsistency, seems to me Inadmissable. The Purport of Instructions, which containd those degrading Restrictions you are fully acquainted with; but by what I have colle[cted] from M<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">r.</span> Tr,<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0009" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0009-ptr">9</a> you are not so fully acquainted with some Endeavors in Congress to procure a Repeal of those Objectiona[ble] Parts. After the C. de Vs was made acquainted with the unbounded Confidence, that Congress by those Instructions placed in the Ministers of his most Christian Majesty, he wrote to Congress, in the Name of his Master, a Letter expressing the Satisfaction that the Confidence gave, &amp; the Moderation that would be discovered in the Use of the Power; that all his Exertions would be to promote the Welfare of his Ally. But intimates, that he has been informed that the Measure was not unanimously agreed to in Congress. And that if the Want of unanimity is likely to produce any Division in Congress, that may tend to destroy the Union &amp; Harmony of that Body, he would willingly relinquish a Deposit, so delicate in its Nature, &amp; of such great Importance He suggests the fresh Obligations his Master is laid under, by this confidential Commission, to render every possible Service to the United States But if Congress should see fit to withdraw the Power, the Obligation will be lessened, &amp; the United States must in Consequence thereof, be particularly attentive to their own Interests The Meaning of which, needs no Comment. If I do not misremember the above is nearly the Purport of the Letter. Notwithstanding this, in the Space of fifteen Months, three several Attempts were made in Congress, to revise &amp; alter those Instructions, But to no Purpose. Those who severely reprobated them, were not clear, that it was expedient to withdraw them.

Vs I am not uneasy now, that the Power was not withdrawn I am happy that the Intention of the Instructions were gloriously eluded.</p>
          <p>I have Reason to beleive, that those Members who warmly supported the Measure at first, have been made to fear the Resentment of the united States. They have endeavored to explain to Congress the Reasons of the Measure. They offer no better, than the extremely exhausted Situation of the Country at that Time, &amp; the Despondency, evident from the small Exertions of all the States. Docto<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">r.</span> Witherspoon has been candid enough on the floor of Congress, to hint at a better Reason, which was, your obstinate Dispute with the C. de. V.s I have always supposd, that the object was to clip your Wings, &amp; make you more tame &amp; docile; &amp; that if they had at first adopted the Idea of having five Commissioners, they would not have made them mere Spectators.</p>
          <p>After the Provisional Treaty arrivd, some were heartily pleasd, &amp; others discovered a Degree of Mortification It was evident that our Comm<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">rs.</span> acted for themselvesthat they put a proper &amp; rational Construction upon their Instructions But it was said that they had grossly disobeyed them That the Court of Fe must unavoidably be extremely irritated; that instead of making the most confidential &amp; unreserved Communications to, &amp; instead of being governed in the least by the Advice of the Ministers of his most C M. They had made, &amp; signed a Treaty, without their Knowledge or Concurrence.not only so they had entered into a private Stipulation with the Minister of great Britain of little or no Consequence to the United States, as pointedly against the Court of Madrid, as it was in favor of G Bn. It was not only unwise to encourage G Bn to carry war into the Floridas, but it was an extraordinary, &amp; unnatural Disobedience of Instructions. Our Commissioners must be immediately censured, &amp; positively directed to communicate the secret Article; otherwise Congress would become Partners in their criminal Secrecy. These Observations did not operate so as to ensure the Party of Success, in a censuring Resolution It was tempered A Proposition was made expressing the great Satisfaction of Congress in the Conduct of their Comm<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">rs.</span> &amp; obliquely censuring them, for that Secret Article This was not palatable It was then said that his most C M had instructed his Minister here, to remonstrate to Congress in severe Terms, against <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0406">[406<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-15/ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0406.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>the Conduct of our Comm<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">rs.</span>; &amp; that Congress would act wisely, to anticipate the Business But this had no better Effect&amp; the Matter subsided<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0010" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0200-fn-0010-ptr">10</a> It was a Matter of Surprize and Astonishment to the Franklinites, that the God of Electricity consented to act with you secretly.

The principal Reason that was urged, for taking it from you, was that there were in Effect two Commissions for the same Purpose: It was insisted upon, that the Ministers for Peace were empowered by their Commission to make such Commercial Stipulations in a Treaty of Peace, as should be found necessarythat this virtually repealed the Commission to you To set the Matter in a clear Point of Light, that there might be no Interference in the Negociations, that the Business might be all done in Concert, seven States revoked your Commission These were some of the Observations made Use of at the Time But I supposd then, &amp; am more confirmed in my Opinion now, that it was a foreign Manuvre, not merely to mortify you, but the real Intention at that Time was, to have no Commercial Treaty with G Bn This Sentiment prevaild very much at that Time; And it is not destitute of warm Advocates now. It is the same with Respect to a commercial Treaty with the Court of S<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">t.</span> Petersburgh. It has been too apparent, that the Court of Verseilles are very anxious to confine our Trade as much, as possible, to themselves.

   <p>When Congress created the post of secretary at war on 7 Feb. 1781, members initially considered appointing former general Philip Schuyler, a close associate of Robert Morris, who had resigned his commission in 1779 after being acquitted by a court-martial. Schuyler, however, refused to be considered for the post unless his rank was restored, and Congress turned to other candidates. After members decided that Gen. Henry Knox and Gen. Nathanael Greene could not be spared from field duties, Gen. Benjamin Lincoln was appointed to the post (same, 2:234235).</p>

   <p>The separate article of the Anglo-American peace treaty negotiated by the American commissioners without Frances knowledge would have set the boundary of West Florida farther north if Great Britain recovered the territory from Spain than if it was retained by Spain.

Livingston responded to Jay on 30 Dec. discounting the intercepted letter, seeking information on its origin, and questioning Jays motivation for sending it. In a 22 July 1783 letter to Livingston, Franklin also commented on the Barb-Marbois letter, calling its British source a suspicious channel of transmission and expressing certainty that despite the letter the French wished the American commissioners to be unconstrained in their pursuit of peace (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

On 17 Sept., Congress reaffirmed Laurens appointment, resolving that the reasons for it remained and that his services in the execution of that trust cannot be dispensed with (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

On 19 Sept., James Madison offered a resolution to the effect that the portion of Congress resolutions of the 17th relating to Laurens should not be sent. Madison charged that if Laurens had signed or played any role in the petition then he had thereby wounded the honor and dignity of the United States in such a manner that he was no longer fit to be entrusted with the character of a public minister, much less to be solicited to continue his services as the negotiator of a peace. In the end, after considerable debate, Madisons motion failed of adoption. But as Osgood, who voted against the motion, indicates, doubts remained about the petition and Laurens loyalty (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Letters of Delegates to Congress, 17741789&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

   <p>Francis Dana wrote Livingston on 8 and 17 Aug. 1783 to inform him that he had terminated his attempts to be recognized by the Russian court and would soon leave St. Petersburg.

   <p>In a 15 Sept. 1781 letter to the president of Congress, written soon after his arrival in Russia, Dana reported that the Marquis de Vrac, French minister to Russia, had advised him that the Russian court was unlikely to receive him until after an Anglo-American peace treaty was signed and that he should consequently not seek to present his credentials. Dana initially rejected the advice and questioned Vracs motives in giving it: He possibly may have other reasons for his opinions, which he chooses to keep to himself; but surely such can not serve as rules by which to regulate my conduct while I remain ignorant of them, nor can I imagine it to be my duty or the expectation of Congress that I should blindly fall into the sentiments of any man, especially when I think this backwardness to give proper support to our cause at the courts of Europe may be accounted for on other principles (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

   <p>Danas letter reached Congress on 15 March 1782 and was apparently among dispatches from foreign ministers referred to a committee composed of James Madison, John Morin Scott, and Daniel Carroll. In a 23 April letter to Edmund Randolph, Madison made his view clear, calling Danas plan to present his credentials over the objections of Vrac a <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">rash</span> step. Livingston shared Madisons view and on 27 May asked Congress to review the draft of a letter to Dana dated 10 May in which he called Vracs advice sound and just and directed Dana to follow it. Consideration of the letter was postponed, however, in favor of the passage of a resolution instructing Dana not to present his credentials untill he shall have obtained satisfactory assurances that he will be duly recd. and recognized in his public Character. Livingstons letter was ordered returned to him without comment, but after receiving it, the secretary sent Dana a new letter, dated 29 May, enclosing the 10 May draft and the resolution (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Papers of James Madison: Congressional Series&lt;/i&gt;, ed.
