   <p>This contract represents one of five that were prepared, each for the sum of one million guilders. It reflects the decision by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> and the bankers not to issue a single contract for five million guilders, as originally planned, because the amount was thought to be too large for a loan with doubtful prospects for success. Instead, the initial offering was to be for three million guilders, with the other two million to be raised later if there was sufficient investor interest. Although the Dutch version of the contract was notarized on 11 June and the English translation was finished on 17 June, the contracts were not sent to Congress until 11 July and then as enclosures in a letter from Wilhem &amp; Jan Willink, Nicolaas &amp; Jacob van Staphorst, and De la Lande &amp; Fynje to Robert R. Livingston (<span class="ref-terms" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;expan&gt;Papers of the Continental Congress.

The delay was caused by the need to prepare 25 copies of the contract in both Dutch and English, five of which were sent to Livingston by five different conveyances. For the transmission of the contracts, see <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s second letter of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-13-02-0098" class="document">5 July</a> to Livingston and his letter of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-13-02-0108" class="document">10 July</a> to Wilhem &amp; Jan Willink, Nicolaas &amp; Jacob van Staphorst, and De la Lande &amp; Fynje, both below.</p>

   <p>Both of these phrases refer to the right of one of several borrowers to pay only its prorated share of the debt. In other words, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> was affirming that the states were collectively responsible for the whole debt rather than that individual states were responsible for only that part that might be apportioned to them.</p>
