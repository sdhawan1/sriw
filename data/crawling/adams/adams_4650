          <p>Under the 26<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">th</span> last April, I did myself the Honour of addressing you, being most sincere in my Congratulations on the happy Issue of the several Important Negotiations, which had been entrusted to your Care<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0063-fn-0001" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0063-fn-0001-ptr">1</a></p>
          <p>With ardent Pleasure the People of this Commonwealth contemplate your expected Return this Fall The highest Honor They can confer awaits you in the Spring<a class="ptr" href="#ADMS-06-15-02-0063-fn-0002" id="ADMS-06-15-02-0063-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> This Sentiment is not founded in the prejudice of Friendship, but on the general Gratitude of an obliged free Community</p>
          <p>Agreeable to my promise, I will attempt giving you a breif Account of the Politics prevailing in this Statetho it will be very imperfect, it must convince that, as yet, we are far from being settled in a System which alone can continue us in that respectable Situation, the Revolution has placed the United States. For the same disposition reigning in some of the other States in the Union, if persevered in, Congress will soon be, only the Shadow of Sovereignty and a Mark of Contempt</p>

The Inhabitants seem convulsed Many Towns instructed their Representatives on the Measure strictly forbidding them to make provision for any part of it</p>

   <p>The 5 percent impost, first proposed in 1781, was finally defeated in Dec. 1782. This was owing partly to Rhode Islands steadfast opposition but ultimately to Virginias decision to reconsider its initial approval and reject the tax (vol. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0085#ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0139" class="pageNo">14:139</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0085%20ADMS-print-06-14-02-0086#ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0140" class="pageNo">140</a>).</p>

   <p>The remainder of this letter concerns the Mass. house of representatives unproductive and divisive deliberations over Congress commutation of pay for Continental Army officers and the impost intended to implement it and service the national debt. The debates began on 5 June and continued until 11 July, the day of adjournment (same, p. 52, 59, 72, 91, 101, 108, 124, 137140, 144, 145, 148, 155, 157159, 165167, 170, 173). Daltons observations reflect his attendance at the sessions as speaker of the house and flesh out the otherwise spare journal accounts of the debates. Not mentioned by Dalton is the 11 July address to Congress from the Mass. General Court that he signed as speaker. The address was read by Congress on 31 July, referred to committee, and <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0131">[131<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-15/ADMS-06-15-02-pb-0131.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>then debated from 16 to 19 Sept., with the final response adopted on the 25th. The General Court attacked the commutation, as well as the pay given to civil officers, for essentially the same reason given by Dalton in the following paragraph, that is, the fear that by its largesse to the military and civil officers, Congress was establishing a civil list similar to that in Great Britain and was thereby exalting certain groups of Americans over their fellow citizens and thereby purchasing their allegiance.</p>

    
   <p>Congress had little problem with Massachusetts objections to the pay of civil officers and, with the war over, voted to reduce salaries and staff. But despite conciliatory proposals made in the course of the debates, there would be no compromise over the commutation. On this issue Congress, in its final resolution of 25 Sept., declared that it was fully within its powers under the Articles of Confederation to establish the compensation due the officers of the Continental Army and that to compromise on that issue would be to diminish its power and undermine the union. Indeed, Congress declared that no State in this Confederacy can claim (more equitably than an individual in a society) to derive advantages from a union, without conforming to the judgment of a constitutional majority of those who compose it; still, however, they conceive it will be found no less true, that if a State every way so important as Massachusetts, should withhold her solid support to constitutional measures of the Confederacy, the result must be a dissolution of the union; and then she must hold herself as alone responsible for the anarchy and domestic confusion that may succeed, and for exposing all these confederated states (who, at the commencement of the late war, leagued to defend her violated rights) an easy prey to the machinations of their enemies, and the sport of European politics (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789&lt;/i&gt;, ed.
