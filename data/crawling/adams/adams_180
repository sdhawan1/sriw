      <p>For the Discussion whereof it may not be amiss to premiss the following Facts.</p>
      <p><span title="marginal note in original" class="margin">Cabot. H. 7</span> 1st. The Continent of N.

      <p><span title="marginal note in original" class="margin">1606. J. 1st.</span> 2. In 1606. K. James the first, of England, granted all the Continent from 34 to 45 Deg. of Northerly Lat. which he divided into two Colonies, the Southern Virginia to certain Merchants of London, the Northern, N.

The Winter being hard and <span title="marginal note in original" class="margin">1608</span> severe, what survived returned to England in 1608 and so the design of settling the Country by them was at an End, and it seems none did much in reviving the design of settling for 9 or 10 years after. But</p>

The Proprietors allarmed at this Invasion of their Property, employed and impowered Samuel Waldo Esqr. to Petition the King that the said Dunbar might be removed, and that they might be quieted in their lawfull Possessions. Sir Bybye Lake a Proprietor in the Eastern Country, joined with Mr. Waldo in the Solicitation, and the Petition being referred to the Board of Trade, they called the Province Agent before them, and a State of the Case was ordered to be drawn up, setting forth the Provinces Claim, how little Expence the Province had been at in defending and improving this. The Conquest made in 1696 by the French, and the Reconquest in 1710, and the Lords of Trade, referred the State with the two following Queries subjoined to the Consideration of the Attorney and Solicitor General vizt. 1st. Whether the Inhabitants of the Massachusetts Bay if they ever had any Right to the Government, of the Tract of Land lying between St. Croix and Kennebec River, have not by their Neglect and even Refusal to defend and take Care of and improve the same, forfeited their said Right to the Government and what Right they had under the Charter and now have to the said Lands. 2. Whether the said Tracts being conquered by the French and afterwards Reconquered by General Nicholson in the late Queens Time, and yeilded up by France to G. Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht, that Part of the Charter relating thereto became vacated, and whether the Government of that Tract, and the Lands thereof are not absolutely revested in the Crown, and whether the Crown has not thereby, sufficient Power to appoint Governors and assign Lands to such Families as shall be desirous to settle there.</p>
