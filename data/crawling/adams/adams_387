      <p>ART. 1. The Commanders of all ships and vessels belonging to the THIRTEEN UNITED COLONIES, are strictly required to shew in themselves a good example of honor and virtue to their officers and men, and to be very vigilant in inspecting the behaviour of all such as are under them, and to discountenance and suppress all dissolute, immoral and disorderly practices; and also, such as are contrary to the rules of discipline and obedience, and to correct those who are guilty of the same, according to usage of the sea.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d089n2" id="PJA03d089n2-ptr">2</a></p>
      <p>ART. 2. The Commanders of the ships of the Thirteen United Colonies, are to take care that divine service be performed twice a day on board, and a sermon preached on Sundays, unless bad weather or other extraordinary accidents prevent it.</p>
      <p>ART. 3. If any shall be heard to swear, curse or blaspheme the name of God, the Captain is strictly enjoined to punish them for every offence, by causing them to wear a wooden collar or some other shameful badge of distinction, for so long a time as he shall judge proper: If he be a commissioned officer, he shall forfeit one shilling for each offence, and a warrant or inferior officer six pence: He who <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0148">[148<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-03/ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0148.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>is guilty of drunkenness (if a seaman) shall be put in irons until he is sober, but if an officer, he shall forfeit two days pay.</p>
      <p>ART. 4. No Commander shall inflict any punishment upon a seaman beyond twelve lashes upon his bare back with a cat of nine tails; if the fault shall deserve a greater punishment, he is to apply to the Commander in Chief of the navy in order to the trying of him by a court martial, and in the mean time he may put him under confinement.</p>
      <p>ART. 5. The Captain is never by his own authority to discharge a commission or warrant officer, nor to punish or strike him, but he may suspend or confine him; and when he comes in the way of a Commander in Chief, apply to him for holding a court-martial.</p>
      <p>ART. 6. The officer who commands by accident of the Captains absence (unless he be absent for a time by leave) shall not order any correction but confinement; and upon the Captains return on board, he shall then give an account of his reasons for so doing.</p>
      <p>ART. 7. The Captain is to cause the articles of war to be hung up in some public places of the ship, and read to the ships company once a month.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d089n3" id="PJA03d089n3-ptr">3</a></p>
      <p>ART. 8. Whenever a Captain shall enlist a seaman, he shall take care to enter on his books the time and terms of his entering in order to his being justly paid.</p>
      <p>ART. 9.

      <p>ART. 10. The men shall (at their request) be furnished with slops that are necessary, by the Captain or Purser, who shall keep an account of the same; and the Captain in his return in the last mentioned article directed to be made, shall mention the amount delivered to each man in order to its being stopped out of his pay.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d089n4" id="PJA03d089n4-ptr">4</a></p>
      <p>ART. 11. As to the term inferior officers the Captain is to take notice, that the same does not include any commission or any warrant officer, except the second master, surgeons mates, cook, armourer, gun-smith, master at arms, and the sail-maker.</p>
      <p>ART. 12. The Captain is to take care when any inferior officers or volunteer seamen are turned over into the ship under his command <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0149">[149<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-03/ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0149.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>from any other ship, not to take<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d089n5" id="PJA03d089n5-ptr">5</a> them on the ships books in a worse quality or lower degree of station, than they served in the ship they were removed from; and for his guidance, he is to demand from the commander of the ship from which they are turned over, a list under his hand of their names and qualities.</p>
      <p>ART. 13. Any officer, seaman or others entitled to wages or prize-money, may have the same paid to his assignee, provided the assignment be attested by the Captain or commander, the master or purser of the ship, or a chief magistrate of some county or corporation.</p>
      <p>ART. 14. The Captain is to discourage the seamen of his ship from selling any part of their wages or shares, and never to attest the letter of attorney of any seaman until he is fully satisfied; the same is not granted in consideration of money given for the purchase of his wages or shares.</p>
      <p>ART. 15. When any inferior officer or seaman dies, the Captain is forthwith to make out a ticket for the time of his service and send the same by the first safe conveyance to the Congress or agents by them for that purpose, appointed in order to the wages being forthwith paid to the executors or administrators of the deceased.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d089n6" id="PJA03d089n6-ptr">6</a></p>
      <p>ART. 16.

The cooper shall make buckets with covers and cradles if necessary for their use.</p>
      <p>ART. 17. All ships furnished with fishing tackle, being in such places where fish is to be had, the Captain is to employ some of the company in fishing, the fish to be distributed daily to such persons as are sick, or upon recovery, if the surgeons recommend it; and the surplus by turns amongst the messes of the officers and seamen without favour or partiality, and <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">gratis</span>, without any deduction of their allowance of provisions on that account.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d089n7" id="PJA03d089n7-ptr">7</a></p>
      <p>ART. 18. It is left to the discretion of the Commander of squadrons to shorten the allowance of provisions according to the exigence of the service, taking care that the men be punctually paid for the same. The like power is given to Captains of single ships in cases of absolute necessity.</p>
      <p>ART. 19. If there shall be a want of pork, the Captain is to order three pounds of beef to be issued to the men in lieu of a two pound piece of pork.</p>
      <p>ART. 20.

And there shall be supplied once a year, a proportion of canvas for pudding bags, after the rate of one ell for every sixteen men.</p>
      <p>ART. 21. If any ships of the Thirteen United Colonies shall happen to come into port in want of provisions, the warrant of a Commander in Chief shall be sufficient to the agent or other instrument of the victualling to supply the quantity wanted; and in urgent cases where delay may be hurtful, the warrant of the Captain of the ship shall be of equal effect.</p>
      <p>ART. 22. The Captain is frequently to order the proper officer to inspect into the condition of the provisions, and if the bread proves damp to have it aired upon the quarter deck or poop, and also to examine the flesh cask; and if any of the pickle be leaked out, to have new made and put in and the cask made tight and secure.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d089n8" id="PJA03d089n8-ptr">8</a></p>

      <p>ART. 24.

      <p>ART. 25.

      <p>ART. 26. When in sight of a ship or ships of the enemy, and at such other times as may appear to make it necessary to prepare for an engagement, the Captain shall order all things in his ship in a proper posture for fight, and shall, in his own person, and according to his duty, heart on and encourage the inferior officers and men to fight courageously, and not to behave themselves feintly or cry for quarters on pain of such punishment as the offence shall appear to deserve for his neglect.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d089n12" id="PJA03d089n12-ptr">12</a></p>

   <p>About his role in drawing up these rules, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> wrote: They were drawn up in the Marine Committee [<ins title="editorial addition or explanation" class="ed">that is, Naval Committee</ins>] and by my hand, but examined, discussed and corrected by the Committee (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Diary and Autobiography of John Adams&lt;/i&gt;, ed. L. H. Butterfield and others, Cambridge, 1961; 4 vols. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Diary and Autobiography</span></span>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-01-03-02-0016-0044#ADMS-01-03-02-pb-0350" class="pageNo">3:350</a>). Nothing in the Journals specifically indicates that either the original committee or the enlarged one was to draft rules for the regulation of a navy, although rules undoubtedly were necessary for ships being fitted out by the congress. Worthington C. Ford, in citing an endorsement by Charles Thomson in a letter from Washington of 5 Oct., seems to have found some authorization for the committees rule-making, but Ford misread the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript ]">MS</abbr>. The endorsement reads: That part of this letter which relates to the capture of a vessel in N. Hampshire referred to the committee appointed to bring in regulations for priv<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ateers]</span>. Ford read the final word of the endorsement as navy. Although Washingtons letter was read on 13 Oct., the part requesting the determination of Congress as to the Property and disposal of such Vessels and Cargoes as are designed for the Supply of the Enemy and may fall into our Hands received no action in subsequent days. In all likelihood, Thomson wrote his endorsement after a committee on disposal of prizes was established on 17 Nov., in response to a second letter from Washington urging that the congress give him guidance on prizes (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C. Ford and others, eds., &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/i&gt;, 17741789, Washington, 19041937; 34 vols. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">JCC</span></span>, 3: 293 and note 2, 357358; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources&lt;/i&gt;, 17451799, ed. John C. Fitzpatrick, Washington, 19311944; 39 vols. ]">Washington, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Writings</span>, ed. Fitzpatrick</span>, 4:11, 73).</p>

       
   <p>The separately printed version of the rules, of which only one copy is known to be extant, that at Yale University, differs in several respects from the version in the Journals. Only the rules regulating the day-to-day conduct of officers and men were separately printed. The rules on rations and wages and the terms of the covenant which officers and men signed upon entering into service would not have been appropriate for a handbook meant to inform them of fixed duties and rights and of penalties for infractions of the rules. Probably for this reason also, the paragraphs were numbered for ease of reference, and some stylistic changes were made (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-03-02-0076-0009&amp;expandNote=PJA03d089n14#PJA03d089n14" class="document">note 14</a>, below), although the order to have the resolutions of the congress printed does not specifically authorize such alterations. The handbook was even provided with an enticing subtitle: Established for Preserving their <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Rights</span> and Defending their <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Liberties</span>, and for Encouraging all those who Feel for their <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Country,</span> to enter into its Service in that way in which they can be most Useful.</p>

       
   <p>One difference between the handbook and the Journals, however, needs another sort of explanation. Thomsons rough draft shows a change of wording in Art. 24 that was included in the transcribed or corrected Journals, but does not appear in the handbook. Obviously the change occurred after the articles went to the printer (<span class="ref-terms" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;expan&gt;Papers of the Continental Congress.

Art. 11, however, does not list a school-master or a corporal, which are mentioned in the British regulation. The former was meant to teach navigation, arithmetic, and writing to young volunteers on British war vessels. The corporal was an assistant to the master-at-arms (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Regulations</span>, p. 136137). In the British regulation comparable to Art. 14 no mention is made of shares. Indeed, the section on prizes makes no mention of anyone sharing in prize money (same, p. 8991).</p>

   <p>Except for the designation of the court which was to have jurisdiction, Art. 24 is a close paraphrase of Art. II, Sect. 7 under 22 Geo. II, ch. 33, passed in 1749 (Danby Pickering, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">The Statutes at Large</span>, Cambridge, Eng., 1765, 19: 327 [cited hereafter <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Statutes</span>]). Although the handbook mentions the congress as the power appointing a court for maritime affairs, the rough Journal has Congress stricken out and the phrase the legislatures in the respective colonies substituted (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-03-02-0076-0009&amp;expandNote=PJA03d089n2#PJA03d089n2" class="document">note 2</a>, above). Obviously the congress was not yet ready for a central court with this jurisdiction. In the fall of 1775 <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> would have seen the original language as an important step toward unification.</p>

   <p>Arts. 28 and 29 on seditious speech and mutinous action were adapted from Art. II, Sect. 19 (same, p. 329330), in which mutiny is mentioned before seditious speech in a single paragraphjust as in the Journal version (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C. Ford and others, eds., &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/i&gt;, 17741789, Washington, 19041937; 34 vols. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">JCC</span></span>, 3:381382). The presumption is that this order was followed in the committee report and changed only when the paragraphs were numbered for printing. Separation into two articles gave greater emphasis to two kinds of conduct. The Americans, however, lumped together speech and attempting to make any mutinous assemblies, behavior which could incur a penalty of less than death. The British punished by death the making of a mutinous assembly, reserving a possible lesser punishment for words alone and failing to make a distinction between assembly and joining in a mutiny.</p>

   <p>Adapted from Art. XIX (same, p. 336), but the British made additional stipulations, particularly when the offense (except mutiny) took place within the narrow seas, that is, the English Channel and Irish Sea. Then approval of the death penalty had to come from the lord high admiral.</p>

   <p>The pardon power for the British was the prerogative of the king. The British rules limit confinement to a maximum of two years and forbid the use of naval court martials for trying soldiers on transports (Arts. III and V, same, p. 332). But generally, the British code is harsher in that it makes the death penalty available for twenty-four offenses; the Americans specify death only for murder. The American rules make no mention of buggery (Art. II, Sect. 29, same, p. 331) nor of a number of other crimes listed in the British rulesspying, aiding the enemy, striking for arrears of wages, failing to protect convoys, wasting ammunition, sabotage of stores or equipment, negligent steering of ships, and several more.</p>

   <p>Under Of the Provisions, Art. I in <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Regulations</span> (p. 61) sets forth a table of rations which probably inspired the American table, but the latter provides for beef or pork on every day except Wednesday; the British on only four days. Where the British provided for beer (wine and spirituous liquors being substitutes), the Americans stipulated rum. The allowances for cheese are equal, but the British allowed 6 oz. of butter per week to the Americans allowance of only 2.</p>

   <p>For officers, rates of pay are difficult to compare, since the British had six different rates for each rank. Thus a British captain, depending upon his rate, could earn from 6s to 1 per day. At 6s per Spanish dollar, the American captain could earn slightly over 6s per day; but an American lieutenant would earn slightly less than 6s per day compared to a maximum of 5s for a British lieutenant. The British able seaman earned 24s per month compared to the American wage of 40s, later raised to 48s (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.

All comparisons must take into account that the British paid in sterling, the Americans in lawful money, which overvalued silver by over one-fourth (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Regulations,</span> p. 146149).</p>

The latter promised to do their duty and abide by the rules, and in return were assured of pay according to schedule and a fair share of prizes, those disabled having first claim on prize money. It is not clear whether the covenant was part of the Naval Committees report. In any case, the covenant is omitted here, for it has no apparent relation to the British regulations.</p>
