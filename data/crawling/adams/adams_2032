     <p>I shall not look through the Notes in my Almanac to see whether I have written to you 22 <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">or</span> 24 times; I shall go upon the easier Task of acknowledging all those I have had from you vizt. Decr. 6 1778 recd. Feb 16th. 79 answered the 17th.  Sepr. 26th. 1778 recd. March 4th. 79 answd. Apr 28th.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA08d072n1" id="PJA08d072n1-ptr">1</a></p>
     <p>Three months ago Mr. G communicated to us that Spain was mediating, and that we ought to take speedy, decisive Measures for Peace.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA08d072n2" id="PJA08d072n2-ptr">2</a> London Gazettes told us the first part; and it appears strange that neither Doctr. F. Mr. L. nor you have <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">hinted</span> this matter to us <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">lately</span> if you did not <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">avow</span> it authoritatively. We have some wise men here who are sure <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">they</span> could fish out all the Court Secrets. In the various Attempts to pull down A L to make way for some one to go from hence who knows all the present Circumstances of America and therefore could negotiate properly, your want of Ability to give us Information such as we wish or fancy can be had is said to spring from the Suspicions of the french Court respecting One of you; and Some thing like an Attempt to dictate to us a Choice has been seen here. An Extract of a Letter from the Count de Vs has been quoted Je crains Mr. A L et ses entoures;<a class="ptr" href="#PJA08d072n3" id="PJA08d072n3-ptr">3</a> and we are tempted to think that <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-08-02-pb-0087">[87<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-08/ADMS-06-08-02-pb-0087.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>therefore the Communication before mentioned came through Mr. GBut this is different from what was once the Conduct; for Mr. Deane tells us that he was <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">directed</span> to tell Doctr. F what he did not <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">chuse</span> to tell Mr. Lee, or, as he wishes to have it believed, which he was <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">forbidden</span> to tell him. I am persuaded Doctr. F would not <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">readily</span> disgust the french Court in such a Point. If there is any Seriousness in the Business, I suppose the Court stood upon the Punctilio of not having the Compliment of a Minister Plenipotentiary returned at that Time.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA08d072n4" id="PJA08d072n4-ptr">4</a></p>
     <p>Mr. Lees Enemies have produced nothing but Innuendoes to procure his Removal, while they dare not deny his Integrity and Abilities in our Service. Mr. Deane says the Lees are not fit for Transactions with a gallant Nation. But doubtless those Men who want his place would be very gallant indeed on certain Points in Negotiation. The eastern States are charged with wanting what they have no Right to and what is of no Interest to the southern States. Plenty are these local Sentiments lately; and R. H. L. with H. Lns are squinted at as two monsters on the other side of Susquehanna who pursue points in which the southern States have <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">no</span> Interest.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA08d072n5" id="PJA08d072n5-ptr">5</a> Would France or England reason thus on the Fishery? I expect however that we shall coalesce in a few days upon what may be Ultimata ready for some future day of Pacification, when Britain shall be restored to her Senses. She is quite wild and foolish yet in my Opinion.</p>

Burnett, ed., &lt;i&gt;Letters of Members of the Continental Congress,&lt;/i&gt; Washington, 19211936; 8 vols. ]">Burnett, ed., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Letters of Members</span></span>, 4:6971). Grard analyzed the political situation in Great Britain and noted Britains unsuccessful efforts to secure allies in her struggle with America. In the French view it was an appropriate time for the United States to moderate its terms for peace; British recognition of independence would alone be sufficiently debilitating. Grard discussed the position of Spain, most notably its opposition to the territorial claims of the United States and to free navigation of the Mississippi River, and disclosed its desire to regain possession of the Floridas and its willingness to pay the United States a subsidy to mount an expedition against the Floridas on condition that the conquered territory be returned to Spain.</p>
      <p>Ostensibly a proposal to promote a quicker and easier peace, Grards message was in fact an attempt to limit American objectives in order to bring them more into line with the aims of France, particularly that of bringing Spain into the war. On 9 Feb., Grard did not disclose those portions of his instructions in which Vergennes indicated his opposition to any effort by the United States to conquer Canada or obtain a share of the Newfoundland fishery. The French position on such acquisitions became clear only with Grards letter of 22 May to the president of the congress in which he declared that France was committed only to the achievement of American independence and would not continue the war for objectives not specifically mentioned in the Franco-American treaties (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Francis Wharton, ed., &lt;i&gt;The Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States,&lt;/i&gt; Washington, 1889; 6 vols. ]">Wharton, ed., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev.</span></span>, 3:175178).</p>
      <p>On 23 Feb. a draft set of peace objectives was reported to the congress. For the next six months, largely because of sectional differences and the difficulty of reconciling French and American objectives, an often acrimonious debate raged, culminating on 14 Aug. in the adoption of instructions to a yet unnamed commissioner charged with negotiating treaties of peace and commerce with Britain (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.

      <p>On 30 April, William Paca rose to give the congress significant evidence on the unsuitability of Arthur Lee as a representative of the United States abroad. A long statement signed by Paca and William Henry Drayton was read by the secretary and placed in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Journal</span> over the objection of Samuel Adams. Paca and Drayton had approached Grard for information on Lees early reception in Madrid and the opinion of the French court about him. Grard furnished the letter from Vergennes, which contained the sentence quoted by Lovell here (26 Oct. 1778, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Despatches and Instructions of Conrad Alexandre Grard, 17781780: Correspondence of the First French Minister to the United States with the Comte de Vergennes,&lt;/i&gt; ed.

      <p>Richard Henry Lee and Henry Laurens supported the position that fishing rights were an essential part of the peace ultimata, to the disgust of many Southern delegates. In the spring of 1779 North Carolina delegates threatened that their state would withhold needed defensive help from South Carolina, on the grounds that Laurens, by his vote in making peace conditional on fishing rights, must believe that his state could carry on by itself a war for more than the countrys original objective  independence (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.

      <p>On 20 Jan. a committee consisting of one member from each state was appointed to consider the conduct of the late and present commissioners of these states in Europe, its creation prompted by a letter from Silas Deane. Elbridge Gerry represented Massachusetts (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C. Ford and others, eds., &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789,&lt;/i&gt; Washington, 19041937; 34 vols. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">JCC</span></span>, 13:93).</p>
      <p>The committees report, made on 24 March, was accompanied by statements of charges, together with their sources, that had been made against Deane, Arthur Lee, Franklin, Ralph Izard, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>, and William Lee. Although the report itself enumerated the names of the commissioners and their assignments, Arts. 3 and 4 of the report, which mentioned complaints against them and suspicions and animosities among them, referred only to the said Commissioners (same, 13:363368).</p>
      <p>The congress debated the report off and on over several weeks until 20 April, when the key issue became whose names should be specifically included in Art. 4 of the report. Gerry sought to have the phrase some of inserted before late and present Commissioners, but his motion lost. Then, without a vote count, the congress agreed to insert Franklins name as one of those among whom suspicions and animosities had arisen. Following the vote, the congress, signifying its decision by yeas and nays in each case, added the names of all the other Commissioners except <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>. New Hampshire, Connecticut, Maryland, and Virginia voted to include <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>, but New York, Pennsylvania, and North and South Carolina were firmly opposed, and Massachusetts vote (as well as Rhode Islands) was divided, Samuel Adams and Lovell voting to include his name; thus the attempt to include <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> in the final resolve failed. Adams and Lovell then tried, unsuccessfully, to postpone any vote on the clause as amended to include the names of the five Commissioners (same, 13:479487). Naturally, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> was astonished that his two friends voted to have his name included.</p>

      <p>The third and final charge against Franklin, that he is not the proper person to be trusted with the management of the affairs of America, that he is haughty and self sufficient, and not guided by principles of virtue or honor, was derived from Izards letter of 28 June 1778 to the president of the congress (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.
