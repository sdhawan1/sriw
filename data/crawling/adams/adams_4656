   <p>The draft treaty was the final effort by <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> and his colleagues to go beyond the preliminary articles signed on 30 Nov. 1782. The draft contains some of the elements of a commercial treaty (see notes 1216) but does not actually deal with the conditions under which trade would take place since the commissioners had no power to conclude a commercial agreement. The draft includes the articles from the preliminary treaty, some of them significantly altered. Others are derived from proposals advanced during the five months that the commissioners waited for the negotiation of the definitive treaty to begin, and some proceed from the actual negotiations with Hartley. The commissioners could have had little expectation of success, and by 21 Aug. 1783 their doubts had been confirmed. On that date Benjamin Franklin wrote to Henry Laurens that it is come finally to this, that the ministers propose our signing, as a definitive treaty, the preliminary articles, with no alterations or additions (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

In their <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-15-02-0067-0002" class="document">letter of 18 July to Livingston</a>, above, the commissioners indicated that they would propose including in Art. 4 language reflecting the substance of Congress resolution, and in fact they had done so in their <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-15-02-0065" class="document">17 July letter to Hartley</a>, and note 4, above.</p>

   <p>Despite being only recommendatory, Art. 5 of the preliminary treaty regarding the restoration of loyalist property was the most controversial article in the treaty and was retained unchanged in the definitive treaty. But in the draft article proposed here as a substitute, only the final sentence was retained from the preliminary treaty. To a significant degree the proposed article reflected the position advanced by Franklin during the negotiation of the preliminary treaty, specifically in a paper read to the negotiators on 29 Nov. 1782 (vol. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0048#ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0088" class="pageNo">14:8889</a>, note 7; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Papers of Benjamin Franklin&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

   <p>With two exceptions, indicated here and in note 9, this article is substantially the same as Art. 7 in the preliminary and definitive treaties. At this point in the preliminary treaty is the passage wherefore all Hostilities both by Sea and Land Shall then immediately cease; all Prisoners, on both Sides Shall be Set at Liberty (vol. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0058#ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0107" class="pageNo">14:107</a>). Presumably the first part of the passage was removed because hostilities had already ceased and were unlikely to be renewed, while the second portion dealing with prisoners likely was omitted because of the drafts new Art. 9.</p>

   <p>This sentence was added as a consequence of Congress resolution of 26 May 1783 and had been proposed to Hartley in <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-15-02-0065" class="document">the commissioners letter of 17 July</a>, and note 2, above.</p>

   <p>The inclusion of the right to navigate the St. Lawrence River in Art. 8 was a significant change from the preliminary treaty. If access to the St. Lawrence was raised previously in the course of the commissioners negotiations with Richard Oswald or Hartley, no record of that discussion has been found.</p>

Such a provision was also among those that the commissioners proposed for the definitive treaty in Dec. 1782, and it reflected the substance of Congress 30 May 1783 resolution concerning prisoners, which Livingston had enclosed with his letter of 31 May (vol. <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0068%20ADMS-print-06-14-02-0069#ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0119" class="pageNo">14:119120</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-14-02-0321%20ADMS-print-06-14-02-0322#ADMS-06-14-02-pb-0512" class="pageNo">512514</a>; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789&lt;/i&gt;, ed.
