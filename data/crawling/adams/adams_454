     <p>I received your Letter of the 12th. Instant by Mr. Tracy. But the One you mention to have sent me some Time before I never got.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d154n1" id="PJA03d154n1-ptr">1</a> I am much obligd by your Exertions to get my Pay augmented, which is now made fully equivalent to the Office. The Concern which you have shewn for the Advancement of my Honor and Interest in a thousand Instances, demands something more than bare Acknowlegements. If the Time should come when my Gratitude can be expressd by Actions rather than Words alone, I shall with Eagerness seize the Occasion to discharge my uncommon Obligations to your Kindness and Friendship.</p>
     <p>Hichbourn, after 3 Months Imprisonment, luckily escapd from his Confinement on board the Preston. He told me he should take the first Opportunity of writing you.</p>
     <p>I am sorry to acquaint you that some of our Masstts. Officers in the Army here have disgracd the Country by practising the meanest Arts of Peculation. Every Subtlety which Avarice could invent, or Rascality carry on, have been used to cheat the Publick by Men who procurd Commissions, not to fight for the Liberty of their Country, but to prey upon its Distresses. Col. David Brewer, Lt. Col. Brown<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d154n2" id="PJA03d154n2-ptr">2</a> and 5 Captains have been tryd for defrauding the Publick. The Colonel and 4 of the Captains have been cashierd.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d154n3" id="PJA03d154n3-ptr">3</a> The Army that will soon be inlisted I hope will be better officerd.

I have, by the Requirement of the General, made some Strictures on the continental Articles as they were published by Order of Congress, and which will be sent to Philadelphia. The Sooner a New Edition of the Articles of War is published the better.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d154n4" id="PJA03d154n4-ptr">4</a></p>
     <p>I must mention one Grievance we are subject to here. Persons who come from the Southward bring with them the Pensilvania Bills of an Emission long before the present Year, and pass them here at the Rate of 6/ to the Dollar. There are thousands here who dont know the Difference of the Currency and thus get trickd. A Person told me that in receiving 8 he lost 15/ Lawfull. This Fraud is the more aggravating, as we are told, that our Colony Bills, though emitted for the Publick Safety, are refusd in Payments at Philadelphia.</p>
     <p>I was in the Gallery yesterday at Watertown, during the Examination of Dr. Church at the Bar of the House, respecting the intercepted Letter of his which has occasiond so much Talk and Uneasiness. He made an artful and masterly Defence. He endeavoured to evade the Censure of the House by insisting, that as it would be before another Court that this Matter must have a final Issue, should the House proceed to expell him it would have a fatal Effect whenever a final Judgement should be given on his Conduct; and to give force to his Objection, adducd the Case of Wilkes, who, though accursd of blaspheming his God and Libelling his King, was not censurd by the House of Commons as a member, till he was declard an Out Law by the Court of Kings Bench, Lest it should have had an undue Influence on the Jury. He told the Court, that the Occasion of his writing the Letter on their Table was that some Time in July he received a Letter from his Brother Fleming advising him to secure his Safety with Government by immediately quitting the Cause of Rebellion, and informing him if he would come to Boston, he (Fleming) would procure him a Pardon. This Letter the Doctor said was wrote in Cyphers and one Day having occasion to light his Pipe he burnt it. He could not tell the Name of the Person who gave it to him, nor find out (though he had been indefatigable in the Inquiry) where she lived. In the Course of his Defence, he told the House, that he was once offerd a Guinea a Day for Life, if he would change Sides. He refusd it, and has been long Subject to Abuse, and outrage in some Instances. And could it be thought, at a Time when he had a Promise from his Country men of a Post that would gratify Avarice itself, he should turn Traitor, with no other view than securing Pardon? (for <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0260">[260<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-03/ADMS-06-03-02-pb-0260.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>he was promisd no more) Such a Conduct would be more than Folly, it would be Insanity.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d154n5" id="PJA03d154n5-ptr">5</a> The Dr. said he let the Letter lay by him 8 or 10 Days when a Thought struck him of making it advantageous to Our Cause, by a fallacious Answer which might gull Fleming and induce him to send the Doctor some important Intelligence. He made the most solemn Appeal to Heaven that this was his only View in writing the Letter. He then pointed out the Paragraphs which he thought to Minds unwarpd by Prejudice would evince this to have been his Design. He observd that there was not a single Paragraph in the Letter which containd Information that could have hurt Us. But that the exagerated Accounts of our Force, Strength and Unanimity, would tend to dishearten the Enemy and keep them quiet, at a Time when we were poorly able to have withstood a vigorous Attack. Those Sentences which lookd as if the Writer despizd or was inimical to the Cause which We are all embarkd in, were necessary to blind his Correspondent and produce the Effect he anticipated from it. He reminded the House that at the Time the Letter was wrote he enjoyd the fullest Confidence, was possessd of some Secrets and perfectly knew the State of our Politicks and intended Manoevres. Therefore his not communicating an Iota that could injure or betray Us was a convincing Reason, that his Views were friendly to the Cause of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">our</span> Country. The Reason he said why he did not intrust his Scheme to a Friend, was because he waited for the Success of it when he should have certainly Communicated the advices he receivd, with his Project for obtaining them. He observd that it was Indiscretion, it was Folly, but conjurd them not to let the Indiscretion of an Hour cancel the Services of his Life. He appeald to the Knowlege of all who knew him for his Principles and Conduct, and for his Uniformity and undeaviating Adherence in them. But it is impossible to write all he said. Let it suffice to acquaint You, That if the Force of Rhetorick and the Powers of Language, if the most Pathetick Arts of Persuasion, enforcd by All the Ingenuity, Sense of Spirit of the Doctor could have made him innocent, he would have appeard spotless as an Angel of Light. A few Days before the Doctor had petitioned the House for a Dismission. After He had gone thro with his Defence and withdrawn, when a Debate insued in the House. Majr. Hawley was for granting him a Dismission, and leaving Censure and Punishment to another Tribunal.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d154n6" id="PJA03d154n6-ptr">6</a> The House after Debate chose a Committee to consider the Doctors Case and report.</p>

But that he meant to provide for his own Safety, without Betraying the Interests of America. And that he is rather to be despizd for Timidity, than damnd for Villainy.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA03d154n7" id="PJA03d154n7-ptr">7</a></p>

   <p>Tudors comments on the Articles of War were enclosed in a letter from Washington to Joseph Reed on 30 Oct. He told Reed that, although Tudor might have made some observations worthy of notice, they should be considered with some degree of caution because a desire of lessening his own trouble may induce him to transfer many matters from a general court martial, where he is the principal actor, to the regimental courts where he has nothing to do (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources&lt;/i&gt;, 17451799, ed.

   <p>The session of the Massachusetts House described by Tudor was officially only a hearing on whether formally to expel Church or accept his letter of resignation of 23 Oct. It resulted in his expulsion on 2 Nov. but little else, for although the House returned Church to custody, it tacitly agreed to leave Censure and Punishment to another Tribunal. The congress, to which the case had been referred on 3 Oct. by the Council of War, was no more willing to take decisive action than the House, and on 7 Nov. resolved only to send Church to a secure gaol in Connecticut.
