     <p>When a great Minister, of an ancient <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[and powerful nation, which <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0351">[351<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-09/ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0351.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>has been renowned]</span> for its Wisdom and Virtue, as well as Power,<a class="ptr" href="#PJA09d245n2" id="PJA09d245n2-ptr">2</a> arises, in a popu<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[lar assembly, which]</span> is the most conspicuous Theater in the World, and declares, a<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[s it were in the]</span> face of the Universe, and with an Air of Reflection, of delibera<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[tion, and of so]</span>lemnity, that, Such and Such, are his own opinions of the Trut<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[h of Facts and]</span> the Probability of future Events, one cannot call in question, his go<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[od faith,]</span> although We may know his Information to be false, and Judgm<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ent errone]</span>ous.</p>
     <p>Lord George Germaine, in the debate in the house of Commons, on the Sixth <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[of this]</span> month, declard that he flattered himself, the completion of the chief <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Wish of]</span> his Heart, Peace with America, on what he thought, good and honourable <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Terms]</span> for Great Britain, was not far off. That he verily believed, and his Belief <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[was not]</span> merely Speculative, but founded, on recent Information, that the moment of con<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ciliation]</span> was near. His Lordship described the misery, which the Americans felt at this <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[time,]</span> and Stated, that the greatest majority of the People there, were ready, and desi<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[rous to]</span> return to their Allegiance, but that they were prevented by the Tyranny of th<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ose who]</span> had got the power of Government into their hands. He did not believe, the Co<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ngress]</span> would ever treat for peace: but from the Condition of Affairs, in America; fr<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[om the]</span> depreciation of their paper currency; from the poverty, and distress of the Coun<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[try]</span> from the great debt, it groaned under; from the dissatisfaction which all Rank<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[s of]</span> people expressed at the Alliance with France; from the little benefit America h<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ad de]</span>rived from that Alliance; from all these considerations, he did believe, that the <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[people]</span> of America, the Assemblies of America, would Soon come to terms.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA09d245n3" id="PJA09d245n3-ptr">3</a></p>
     <p>In the Phrase good and honourable Terms for great Britain, there may be some <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[am]</span>biguity: but there can be no reasonable doubt, that his Lordship meant, either to <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[return]</span> to their allegiance to Great Britain, or at least, to make a Peace with her separ<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ate]</span> from France.</p>
     <p>Whether the Americans ever will agree to Such Terms, or not, being a question con<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[cern]</span>ing a future Event, cannot be decided by Witnesses, nor in any other Way, than by p<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ro]</span>bable Arguments. There is one Argument, which his Lordship does not appear to h<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ave]</span> considered. It is of some Weight. It is this. That in order to return to their A<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[lle]</span>giance, to the King of England, or make a Peace with him; Separate from France<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[,]</span> they must involve themselves, in a certain War, with France and Spain, at least<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[,]</span> and, indeed, according to present appearances, with Russia, Sweeden, Denmark<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[, and H]</span>olland and Portugal; for every one of these appears to be as decided, against <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0352">[352<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-09/ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0352.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span><span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[the Claims, Pretensions and Usurpations of Great Britain, upon the Seas as France and Spain, are. There is not an American Merchant, Yeoman Tradesman, or Seaman, but what knows this or will know it very soon. Ameri]</span>cans must therefore be des<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[titute of that common share of Reason which God]</span> has given to Men, to exchange the Friendship <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[of all the nations of the Wor]</span>ld for their Enmity, merely for the Sake of returning to a Con<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[nection with Great Britain, which]</span> could not protect them, and which they have the best reasons <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[to dread as the g]</span>reatest Evil that could befal them, from the unheard of Tyrannies <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[and Cruelties]</span> they have already experienced from her. His Lordship is desired to co<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[nsider this,]</span> and to ask himself, if he was an American, whether he would wish to <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[run un]</span>der the broken, falling Fragments, of an Empire that is dashed to <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Pieces, li]</span>ke a China Vase,<a class="ptr" href="#PJA09d245n4" id="PJA09d245n4-ptr">4</a> and commence a fresh War,<a class="ptr" href="#PJA09d245n5" id="PJA09d245n5-ptr">5</a> against a Combination <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[of all the]</span> nations of the World, who now discover a degree of Esteem and regard <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[for Am]</span>erica?</p>
     <p><span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[If the A]</span>mericans are as miserable as his Lordship represents them, will they be likely <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[to incre]</span>ase that misery, and make it indefinite or perpetual,<a class="ptr" href="#PJA09d245n6" id="PJA09d245n6-ptr">6</a> by espousing the <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Cause of]</span> a ruined Empire, and going to War, with half a dozen, that are not <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ruined]</span>?</p>
     <p><span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[If We]</span> believe the Testimonies of Witnesses, who come from all parts of America, We sha<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ll be con]</span>vinced<a class="ptr" href="#PJA09d245n7" id="PJA09d245n7-ptr">7</a> that his Lordship deceives himself. Every Man from that country <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[who kn]</span>ows, the Principles and opinions of the People, declares, that they are, with an <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Unani]</span>mity that is unexampled in any other Revolution, firmly determined, to ma<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[intain t]</span>heir Sovereignty, and their Alliances, and that there is nobody in America <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[that]</span> whispers a Wish of returning to the Government of Great Britain, or of m<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[aking]</span> a Seperate Peace. But if his Lordship was a candid Enquirer after Truth, <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[and]</span> had a mind Sufficiently enlightened to discover the means that are in the <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Power]</span> of all men, of obtaining it, he might detect<del title="deleted text">&lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">ed</span>&gt;</del> his Error. There are certain <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Mar]</span>ks, by which the opinions, Inclinations, and Wishes of a People may, with <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[infa]</span>llible Certainty be discovered, without recurring to Witnesses, or to remote <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[arg]</span>uments.</p>
     <p><span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Th]</span>e Press; the Towns; the Juries; and the Assemblies, to mention, no more <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[are]</span> four Sources, from whence an unerring demonstration of the true Sen<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ti]</span>ments of the People of America, may be drawn.</p>
     <p><span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Th]</span>ere is not in any nation of the World, So unlimited a Freedom of the Press, as is now established in every State of America, both by Law and Practice. Every Man in Europe, who reads their Newspapers, must See it. There is nothing, that the People dislike, that they <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0353">[353<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-09/ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0353.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>dont attack. They attack Governors and Magistrates of every denomination, officers and Generals of the Army of every Rank, assemblies and Councils, Members of Congress and Congress itself, whenever they dislike their Conduct. But I appeal to every Newspaper, upon the Continent, whether one Paragraph, one Wish,<a class="ptr" href="#PJA09d245n8" id="PJA09d245n8-ptr">8</a> or one H<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[int of]</span> returning to the Government of Great Britain, or making a Seperate Peace, has ever ap<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[peared. The Towns, in America, are small districts of Territory, on an Average, perhaps Six miles Square by the ancient Laws of the Country, which are Still in force, any Seven Inhabitants]</span> of one of these Towns <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[have a right to demand of the Magistrates a public]</span> assembly, of all. There are necessarily, <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[several of these Townmeetings, ev]</span>ery yearand generally, a great number of them. In th<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ese assemblies every]</span> Man, high and low; every Yeoman, Tradesman, and even <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[day Labourer, as well]</span> as every Gentleman and public magistrate,<a class="ptr" href="#PJA09d245n9" id="PJA09d245n9-ptr">9</a> has a right to vo<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[te]</span> and <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[to speak his senti]</span>ments of public Affairs; to propose measures; to instruct their Repr<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[esentatives in the]</span> Legislature &amp;c. This right was constantly, and frequently, used, under <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[the former]</span> Government, and is now, much more frequently used, under the new. T<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[he World has]</span> Seen some hundreds of Sets of these Instructions to Representatives, under the <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[former Gov]</span>ernment, wherein they enjoined, an open Opposition to Judges, Governors, <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Acts of Parlia]</span>ment, King, Lords and Commons of Great Britain. What is there now, to <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[prevent]</span> them from opposing Congress? Nothing. Has a Single Vote of one of these T<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[owns been]</span> read, or one Speech heard, proposing, or uttering a Wish to return to the Go<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[vernment]</span> of Great Britain? Not one. Is not this then a demonstration of the Sen<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[timents]</span> of the People?</p>
     <p>Juries, in America, were formerly, another organ, by which the Sentiments <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[of the]</span> People were conveyed to the Public. Both grand Juries and petit Juries, have ex<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[pressed]</span> themselves, in Language, Sufficiently bold and free, against Acts of Parliament<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[, and]</span> the Conduct of Great Britain: but has any one ever uttered a Word against Co<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ngress,]</span> or the Assemblies, or the Judges under their new Governments, or a Wish to <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[return]</span> to the Obedience of England? Not one.</p>
     <p>But it is said, that the Paper money, embarrasses Congress. What then? Does <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[this]</span> tend to make them dissolve their Union? to violate their Alliances? Would <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[the]</span> Paper Money embarrass Congress, less, if they had a War to maintain aga<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[inst]</span> France and Spain, than it does now? Would not the Embarrassment be much <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[greater.]</span> Does <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0354">[354<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-09/ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0354.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>the Paper money, prevent the Increase and the Population of the States? <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[No.]</span> Does the War prevent it?

The Truth is that Agriculture and Manuf<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[actures,]</span> not of Luxuries but of Necessaries, have been so much increased, by this War, in America that it is much to be doubted whether they ever fed and cloathed themselves more easi<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[ly or]</span> more comfortably. But besides this, the immense depredations they have made up<span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[on the British Trade, have introduced vast quantities, of british Merchandizes of every Sortand in Spight of all the Exertions of the British fleet, their Trade is opening and extending with various Countries]</span> every year, and <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Britain herself is forced to aid it, and will be more and]</span> more, a recent Proof of which, is the <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Permission to import American Tob]</span>acco into the Kingdom, from any Part of the World in <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Neutral Bottoms.

   <p>This paragraph does not appear in the Letterbook. In the recipients copy it begins at the bottom of the fourth page and continues at the top of the fifth. Some portions of words were lost due to damage to the left and right margins of page four; the missing material has been restored here through consideration of the context of the word, except in the case of <span title="text unclear" class="unclear">[Sen]</span>ates, which is taken from the translation in <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Mercure</span>. Damage at the top of page five resulted in the loss of a considerable amount of material. The text of this paragraph as printed has been reconstructed by consulting the French translation in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Mercure</span>, but because it is a translation the reconstruction can be only conjectural and thus the French text provided in note 18 should be consulted. It should also be noted that in the reconstruction, allowance has been made for the space available in the manuscript to accommodate the reconstructed text. The reconstruction should also be compared with the text of corresponding paragraphs, the third and fourth from the end, that is provided with the calendar of <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s letter of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0234" class="document">2 June</a> to the president of Congress (No. 77, calendared, below).
