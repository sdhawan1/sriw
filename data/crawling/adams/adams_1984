     <p>By this Vessel we have the pleasure of hearing the Alliance arrived at Brest in Three Week passage. Not one syllable of News Transpires, we are impatient of hearing what is doing on your side of the Water, some grand secrets, are in the Cabinet Councils, that the Public wish to have handed out. I hope no dishonorable Peace will take place, we had rather linger out this distructive War, for Years, then leave our Enemies incircled about us, from Nova Scotia to the Froridas, with perhaps the Loss of the Fishery, while we are left only to Possess the skirts of the Shores. These are horrible Ideas, that I hope will be absorbed in Conquest and utter extirpation of our Enemies from the Continent of America and end in glorious Peace.</p>

      <p>The Penobscot Expedition, mounted by Massachusetts, was a disastrous failure. The British had set up a fort near what is now Castine, Maine, in order to provide a protective outpost. Como. Dudley Saltonstall of the Continental Navy commanded the fleet sent to Penobscot. His ineffectiveness and delays in wholly engaging the enemys ships were matched by Gen. Solomon Lovells lack of vigor.</p>
     </div>
     <p>Lovell, commander of the militia recruited from Massachusetts and New Hampshire, delayed following up a successful assault on the peninsula where the British fort stood. Lack of coordination of the two commands led to indecision and further delay, until the British were reinforced by Sir George Collier with ten ships and 1,000 troops. Fleeing up the Penobscot River, the Americans abandoned and burned their ships and sought their way home over land. They lost all their ships and nearly 500 men. A Massachusetts General Court investigation blamed Saltonstall for the failure.

Henry Clinton on the expedition, Tryon stated: I confess myself in the sentiments of those who apprehend no mischief to the public from the irritation of a few in the rebellion if a general terror and despondency can be awakened (K.
