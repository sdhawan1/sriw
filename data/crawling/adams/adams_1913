     <p>I am well informed that two Indorsements have been made on the Accounts<a class="ptr" href="#PJA07d304n1" id="PJA07d304n1-ptr">1</a> I have had the Honour to present to the Commissioners, one of which contains Accusations as injurious to my Reputation as they are false and malignant.

     <div class="quoteFT">
      <div class="floatingText">
        <p>N B The Order from B Franklin and John Adams Esqrs. to the public Banker for the Payment of all Mr. Williamss Demands is dated the 10th July,<a class="ptr" href="#PJA07d304n2" id="PJA07d304n2-ptr">2</a> yet he charges a Louis dor a Day from that Time to the 11th of August, besides the whole Charge being such as was never heard of before.</p>

     <p>The Charge here mentioned appears to me reasonable, and is by no Means unprecedented. I left Nantes by Order of the Commissioners to lay my Accounts before themI was a long Time in Paris for the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">sole</span> Purpose of having them settled, and I returned as soon as I thought myself justifiable in so doing. Five Louis Per Day is certainly not an Object for a Merchants Absence from his Business.</p>
     <p>The second Indorsement contains Accusations of a most criminal and atrocious Nature, and which if true would deservedly brand me <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-07-02-pb-0387">[387<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-07/ADMS-06-07-02-pb-0387.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>with the Name of Villain; but I trust in God my Character (hitherto unimpeached) will stand the piercing Eye of Justice, and this Appelation be elsewhere more effectualy applied.</p>

        <p>I have examined the within Accounts, the Articles of which may be distinguished into such as are without Orders or manifestly unjust, or plainly exorbitant, or altogether unsatisfactory for want of Names, or Dates, or Receipts, or any other Voucher whatsoever. Being also perfectly satisfied from his own Accounts that Mr. Williams has now and has long had in his Hands upwards of an hundred thousand Livres belonging to the Public, and which have not been employed to the Public Use, or by Order of those who were entrusted with the Public Money, I do refuse to concur in passing these Accounts or allowing the Balance demanded and do protest against such Use of the Public Money.</p>

     <p>This violent Attack on what is most dear and valuable to an honest Man was so privately made, that I am indebted to Accident only for the Knowlege of it. He who can deliberately massacre the Reputation of an other, must not only be lost to the exquisite Feelings of Humanity in himself, but must delight in glutting his Soul with the Carnage of Characters.</p>
     <p>The Accusation of my Transactions being without Authority, is an Affront to the Characters of Doctor Franklin and Mr. Dean for I have their express Orders to support me in thembut if I had not, would the sending Cloathing for thirty thousand american Troops be considered as a CrimeThat my Charges are exorbitant I deny, and I pledge myself to prove that the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">whole</span> Profit issueing to me from the Public Business for eighteen Months, and for shipping Supplies to the Amount of near three Millions two hundred thousand Livres (of which only about two hundred thousand Livres were taken) does not exceed an averaged Commission of one and a quarter Per Cent. Compare this, Gentlemen, with the common Charges on American Business in Nantes, and you will find that if five Per Cent was to be charged only on the Sale of three Cargoes of Tobacco (and this is the usual Charge) it would more than equal all the Reward of all my Services. In short the being usefull to my Country and the Establishment of my Reputation, have been Considerations with me superior to any Emolument, as is evinced by the moderate Commission I charged.</p>

     <p>Mr. Lees Assertion that I have upwards of an hundred thousand Livres Public Money in my Hands, I have Charity to think he does not believe to be a Fact; and surely the Protest is an Insult on you who have approved my Drafts for the Money which is here said to be used for private Purposes.</p>
     <p>My Character, Gentlemen has been too long wounded by Mr. Leemy Accounts too long unsettled, and as it is my Intention to depart soon to America, I humbly conjure you to fix on some Method whereby my Reputation can be vindicated from such unjust Slanders, or my Conduct publicly reprehended and condemned. To this Purpose as the major Part of the Public Debts under my management were contracted in and near Nantes, and as the Persons live in this Neighbourhood, I earnestly request you to order an Examination of my Accounts. There are here several Gentlemen of Character Residents of America who are well versed in commercial Transactionspermit me to mention their NamesMr. William Blake, Mr. Daniel Blake, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Fendall, Mr. Wharton, Mr. Ridley, Mr. Ross, Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Oglivie. Choose if you please, all these Gentlemen to scrutinize my Charges and Vouchers, or refer them to any three of them, and I will recall every Allowance for my Services, whether under the Name of Commission, or otherwise, and for these as well as for the whole of my Accounts, I will abide by their Decision.<a class="ptr" href="#PJA07d304n4" id="PJA07d304n4-ptr">4</a></p>

      <p>The accounts to which williams refers comprised two groups: the first settled through 30 May 1778; the second through 10 Sept. 1778. What is apparently a duplicate of the first group, for it does not contain Lees endorsement, is in the Lee Papers (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ University of Virginia Library ]">ViU</span>). The second group has not been found, but see Williams to the Commissioners, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-07-02-0048" class="document">22 Sept. 1778</a> (above). The fate of the specific set of accounts on which Lee entered his endorsements and returned to the Commissioners archive at Passy is unknown.</p>
      <p>As is indicated on the second endorsement copied by Williams in this letter, Lee apparently examined the accounts and made his entries in Oct. 1778. According to Lee, he returned the accounts to Passy, presumably to the Commissioners papers that were in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s custody (Lee to Franklin, 16 March, <span class="ref-terms" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;expan&gt;Papers of the Continental Congress.

In a letter to Arthur Lee on 27 March, Franklin explained both his request for the papers and the reason that the accounts had gone so long unnoticed: It was not till lately that, being pressed by M. Monthieu for a settlement of his accounts, and finding that they had a reference to Mr. Williams, I got those from Mr. Adams. They were put up in a paper case, which covered the note you had made upon them, and that case was fastened with wax. This prevented the notes being before seen either by myself or by Mr. Adams, among whose papers you had left those accounts (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Francis Wharton, ed., &lt;i&gt;The Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States,&lt;/i&gt; Washington, 1889; 6 vols. ]">Wharton, ed., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev.</span></span>, 3:101).</p>
      <p><abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> delivered the papers to William Temple Franklin, who probably undertook the examination, for it was he who informed Jonathan Williams, in a letter not found, of Arthur Lees endorsements (Williams to Temple Franklin, 28 Jan., <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ I. Minis Hays, comp., &lt;i&gt;Calendar of the Papers of Benjamin Franklin in the Library of the American Philosophical Society,&lt;/i&gt; Philadelphia, 1908; 5 vols. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Cal. Franklin Papers, A.P.S.</span></span>, 4:14). <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> was as displeased with the endorsements and Lees apparent effort to conceal them as were Benjamin Franklin and Jonathan Williams. In his letter to Lee of 27 March, Franklin wrote: Mr. Adams spoke in strong terms of your having no right to enter notes upon papers without our consent or knowledge, and talked of making a counter entry, in which he would have shown that your assertion of our having given an order for the payment of all Mr. Williams demands was not conformable to truth nor the express terms of the order (that of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-06-02-0212" class="document">10 July</a> to Ferdinand Grand, vol. 6:277278), but his attention being taken up with what related to his departure, was probably the cause of his omitting to make the entry (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Francis Wharton, ed., &lt;i&gt;The Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States,&lt;/i&gt; Washington, 1889; 6 vols. ]">Wharton, ed., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev.</span></span>, 3:101102).</p>
      <p>So far as Lee was concerned, the present letter may have been the last straw. (Williams sent him a copy on 8 March [<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ University of Virginia Library ]">ViU</span>: Lee Papers, with an attached note by Hezekiah Ford; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ I.

Franklin Papers, A.P.S.</span></span>, 4:283]). Although Lee had written the congress in the past, criticizing Williams dubious accounting practices, on 23 April he composed a 46-page Memorial (<span class="ref-terms" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;expan&gt;Papers of the Continental Congress.

Usually cited in the present work from the microfilms, but according to the original series and volume numbering devised in the State Department in the early 19th century; for example, PCC, No. 93, III, i.e. the third volume of series 93.&lt;/expan&gt; ]">PCC</span>, No. 83, II, f. 176222), which was later published as <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Observations on Certain Commercial Transactions in France</span> (Phila., 1780; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Charles Evans and others, comps., &lt;i&gt;American Bibliography: A Chronological Dictionary of All Books, Pamphlets and Periodical Publications Printed in the United States of America&lt;/i&gt; [[16391800]], Chicago and Worcester, 19031959; 14 vols. ]">Evans</span>, No. 16819). There Lee, using portions of his correspondence with Williams and Franklin, sought to support his charges of wrongdoing, including those in the two endorsements, and to refute Williams defense. In doing so, he bitterly attacked Benjamin Franklins acquiescence in his nephews activities.</p>

      <p>Williams gives only the last half of the endorsement. The first half, containing some details of Williams reparation of arms at Nantes, can be found in Lees Memorial (f. 197198).</p>

      <p>In a letter of 13 March (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Houghton Library, Harvard University ]">MH-H</span>: Lee Papers) Franklin stated that, as a consequence of the charges made in the endorsement of 6 Oct., he had decided to have the accounts carefully examined and asked Lee to inform him of any other charges against Williams. He also expressed regret that Lee had informed neither him nor <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr> of the endorsement at the time that it was made, so that the matter could have been resolved then. On 16 March, Franklin wrote to Williams to inform him of this decision and added J. D. Schweighauser to the list of disinterested referees proposed by Williams (Edward E. Hale and Edward E. Hale Jr., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Franklin in France, 2</span> vols., Boston, 18871888, 1:283284).</p>
      <p>Although the exact makeup of the panel cannot be determined with certainty (see Hezekiah Fords note on the copy of this letter of 31 Jan. sent to Lee by Williams, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ University of Virginia Library ]">ViU</span>: Lee Papers), it apparently met and, from Williams point of view, exonerated him (Williams to <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-08-02-0201" class="document">1 Feb. 1780</a>, below).</p>
