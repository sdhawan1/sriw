          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">We had the honour of receiving your Letter of Jan<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">ry:</span> 24. covering a translation into French of the Draught of a treaty proposed between His Majesty the King of Prussia &amp; the United States of America, together with answers to the several articles. We have considered them with attention, &amp; with all those dispositions to accomodate them to the wishes of His Majesty which a respect for his character, &amp; a desire of connecting the two nations in amity &amp; commerce would naturally produce. We will now take the liberty of troubling you with the result of our deliberations article by article.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Art. 2. We agree to add the restriction proposed to the end of this clause, to wit, submitting themselves nevertheless to the laws &amp; usages there established, and to which are submitted the citizens of the United States, and the citizens &amp; subjects of the most favoured nations.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Art. 3. Agreed to add a like clause, to wit submitting themselves nevertheless to the laws &amp; usages there established, and to which are submitted the subjects of His Majesty the King of Prussia &amp; the subjects &amp; citizens of the most favoured nations.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Art. 4. Three effects of this article are objected to.</p>
          <ul class="simple">
	    <li>1. the permission to export &amp; import all the merchandize of either country without exception.</li>
	    <li>2. the permission to <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">all persons</span> to be buyers &amp; sellers.</li>
	    <li>3. the not extending in express terms the right of transportation beyond the vessels of the two contracting parties.</li>
	  </ul>

          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">As to the first we agree to make to the clause the addition proposed, to wit, Nevertheless the King of Prussia &amp; the United States, and each of them, reserve to themselves the right to prohibit in their respective countries the importation &amp; exportation of all merchandize whatsoever, when reasons of State shall require it. In this case the subjects or citizens of either of the contracting parties shall not import nor export the merchandize prohibited by the other. But if one of the contracting parties permits any other nation to import or export the same merchandize, the subjects or citizens of the other shall immediately enjoy the same liberty.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">With respect to the second object, a permission to <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">all persons</span> to become buyers &amp; sellers in this intercourse, it does indeed interfere with the practice of some nations of Europe, wherein the right of buying &amp; selling particular articles of merchandize is frequently given to particular persons or discriptions of persons exclusively. The origin of this practice is to be found in a very remote &amp; unenlightened period, when religion, physics, &amp; every other branch of science was sophisticated &amp; abused. The progress of information &amp; of liberal sentiment has led to reformations in those and in this also seems to have matured principles which should produce a reformation equally wanted. Commerce performs the important office of procuring vent for superfluities, of supplying wants, &amp; of adjusting prices. on a reasonable scale. This it does best where it is freest. Casting an eye over the states of Europe we find them wealthy &amp; populous nearly in proportion to the freedom of their commerce. and we may conclude from thence that were it perfectly free, they would probably attain the highest points of wealth &amp; population of which their other circumstances would admit. A free competition between buyers &amp; sellers, is the most certain means of fixing the true worth of merchandize: on the other hand the restraint of this right to particular persons which constitutes a monopoly, has been found in experience the most powerful engine ever employed for the suffocation of commerce. It is interesting to both parties therefore to guard against this in their stipulations. The law of Konigsberg which prohibits a foreigner from selling his merchandize to any but native subjects, is a monopoly in a certain degree. It would rather seem desireable that foreigners should come into our ports &amp; there transact together all their business of exchange. It is not for us to judge whether under actual circumstances this law of Konigsberg is a proper object of reformation. His Prussian Majesty will decide this, who has already so much extended the limits of happiness for
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-16-02-pb-0416">[416<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-16/ADMS-06-16-02-pb-0416.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>
his subjects by the removal of other bars to which time &amp; habit had given their sanction. Should it be indispensable to save the force of this law, we would propose to retain the expressions in this article which give freedom to all buyers &amp; sellers but that at the end of the addition before agreed to a further one should be made in this form. Nor shall this article derogate from the force of the laws of the city of Konigsberg, which forbid traffic between foreigners within the limits of their jurisdiction. This will guard against monopoly so much of the feild of commerce as is not already occupied by it. We wish however that in this article the word persons should be substituted instead of the subjects or citizens of that other. &amp; again instead of the said subjects or citizens.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">The third objection to this article is that it does not extend the right of transportation beyond the vessels of the two countries. It was thought that the securing this right so far was making a valuable step towards the freedom of intercourse. A right would remain to each party of refusing that privilege to vessels foreign to both; a right which probly would never be exercised but in retaliation on any particular nation adopting that narrow principle. We abandon freely the reservation in its general form in pursuit of an object so valuable to mankind as the total emancipation of commerce &amp; the bringing together all nations for a free intercommunication of happiness. And agree after the words in their own to insert or any other. but we still propose it for consideration whether it will be expedient to either party to disarm itself entirely of the power of retaliating on any particular nation which may restrain the loading of vessels to articles of the growth or manufacture of the country to which they belong? Circumstances may be produced which would render the retaliation essential to the honour &amp; interests of the parties. We therefore propose after the words reserve to themselves the right in the amendment before agreed to, to insert these where any nation restrains the transportation of merchandize to the vessels of the country of which it is the growth or manufacture, to establish against such nation retaliating regulations; and also the right</p>

merchandize of the other, which all persons shall in like manner be free to sell them paying in both cases such duties, charges &amp; fees only as are or shall be paid by the most favored nation. <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Nevertheless the King of Prussia and the United States &amp; each of them reserve to themselves the right where any nation restrains the transportation of merchandize to the vessels of the country of which it is the growth or manufacture to establish against such nation retaliating regulations; and also the right to prohibit in their respective countries the importation and exportation of all merchandize whatsoever when reasons of state shall require it. In this case the subjects or citizens of either of the contracting parties shall not import nor export the merchandize prohibited by the other. But if one of the contracting parties permits any other nation to import or export the same merchandize the citizens or subjects of the other shall immediately enjoy the same liberty.

          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Art. 5. We agree that the fifth article shall stand in the form proposed, to wit, the merchants, commanders of vessels, or other subjects or citizens of either party shall not within the ports or jurisdiction of the other be forced to unload any sort of merchandize into any other vessels, nor to receive them into their own, nor to wait for their being loaded longer than they please.</p>

But they are perfectly willing to relieve such persons from all loss on this account by permitting them to sell the inheritance and withdraw the proceeds without any detraction. Again, tho with them it is a fundamental principle that every man has a natural right to quit the country in which either chance or choice has placed him, and to become a Member of any other where he thinks he can be happier, and the laws of some of them direct the particular form in which it is to be done, &amp; therefore these States can pass no law to prevent the emigration of their fellow-citizens, yet they will respect the principles of other governments where the practice is different. We consent therefore to add to the end of this clause, from the 8<span class="hi-super" style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 0.8; vertical-align: super;">th</span> of the project these words and exempt from all rights of detraction on the part of the government of the respective States.

          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Art. 13. The stipulation to pay a reasonable compensation for the loss such arrest shall occasion to the proprietors is not so determinate as to save the necessity of a future arrangement. It was thought questionable whether any mode which might now be thought of, might not, by a change of circumstances, before the case should arise, become inapplicable: and that arrangements would then be easily &amp; amicably taken for doing justice to the individuals interested. We are ready however to receive a proposition for defining the mode at this time. We agree also to the addition proposed to this clause, to wit, but in the case supposed of a vessel stopped for articles heretofore deemed contraband, if the master of the vessel stopped will deliver out the goods supposed to be of contraband nature he shall be admitted to do it, &amp; the vessel shall not in that case be carried into any port, nor further detained, but shall be allowed to proceed on her voyage.</p>

Were the clause now under cosideration to be so changed as to exclude the prizes made on the enemies of either from being sold in the ports of the other, and that kind of stipulation to take place generally, it would operate very injuriously against the United States in cases wherein it is not presumed his Majesty would wish it. For suppose them to be hereafter in war with any power in Europe, their enemy, tho excluded from the ports of every other State, will yet have their own ports at hand, into which they may carry &amp; sell the prizes they shall make on the United States, but the United States under a like general exclusion, having no ports of their own in Europe their prizes in those seas must be hazarded across the ocean to seek a market at home: an incumbrance which would cripple all their efforts on that element, &amp; give to their enemies great advantage over them.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Art. 21. Agreed to add as proposed but by the judicatures of the place into which the prize shall be conducted.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Art. 25 Agreed to add as proposed but if any such Consuls shall exercise commerce, they shall be submitted to the same laws &amp; usages to which the private individuals of their nation are submitted in the same place</p>

The annotation has been limited to those instances in which the language offered by the commissioners differs from that in the treaty of 10 Sept., or where the commissioners commented at length on the Prussian proposals. It should also be noted that the commissioners may have enclosed with this letter a list of proposed changes to Thulemeiers French translation of the treaty, and while the Prussian diplomat does not mention receiving it, several of the proposed changes appear in the final treaty (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Papers of Thomas Jefferson,&lt;/i&gt; ed.

   <p style="text-indent: 1.5em; text-align: left;">Here and in the second line below, the word persons was replaced in the final treaty with the phrase Subjects or Citizens.

It should be noted that Art. 8 of the draft is virtually identical to Art. 6 of the 1783 Swedish-American treaty, which does not mention any disqualification owing to alienage (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America,&lt;/i&gt; ed.
