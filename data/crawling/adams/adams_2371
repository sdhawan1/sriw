      <p>John Adams letter of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002" class="document">19 April 1780</a> to the president of Congress (No. I, below), constitutes his redaction of Thomas Pownalls pamphlet entitled <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">A Memorial, Most Humbly Addressed to the Sovereigns of Europe, on the Present</span><span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0158">[158<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-09/ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0158.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">State of Affairs, Between the Old and New World</span>, London, 1780. In July, Adams used his Letterbook copy to produce a manuscript (<a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0003" class="document">No. II</a>, below) that, considerably revised from that of the letter, served as the text for two published versions: <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penses sur la rvolution de lAmrique-Unie, extraites de louvrage anglois, intitul mmoire, address aux souverains de lEurope, sur ltat prsent des affaires de lancien and du nouveau-monde</span>, Amsterdam, 1780; and <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">A Translation of the Memorial to the Sovereigns of Europe upon the Present State of Affairs Between the Old and New World into Common Sense and Intelligible English</span>, London, 1781.</p>
      <p>The letter of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002" class="document">19 April</a> and the revised, published versions of it are crucial to understanding the development of John Adams views regarding an Anglo-American peace settlement, the Franco-American alliance, and the future position of the United States in European affairs. Almost without exception, his later writings on foreign policy and his actions as a diplomat reflect his reading of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>. Adams testified to the impact of Pownalls thinking in his letter to Edmund Jenings of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-10-02-0005" class="document">18 July</a> (below), and the truth of his assertion is evident in his published replies to speeches made in the House of Commons in early May by Gen. Henry Seymour Conway and Lord George Germain (to Edm Jacques Genet, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0201" class="document">17</a> and <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0224" class="document">28</a> May, both below); his Letters from a Distinguished American, published in 1782, but written in June and July 1780 (<a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0312-0001" class="document">[<ins title="editorial addition or explanation" class="ed">ante 1422 July</ins>]</a>, below); and his exchanges with the Comte de Vergennes in June and July over Congress monetary policy, the exercise of his commissions, and the adequacy of French assistance to the American cause (below).</p>
      <p>It is not an overstatement to say that the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> had more influence on John Adams views of foreign policy than any other single published work. This does not mean that Pownalls pamphlet was the source of Adams ideas concerning the relationship between the United States, Britain, France, and the European community in general. Those were the product of his evolution from a loyal subject of the British Empire to a revolutionary committed to independence and can be traced from his Dissertation on the Canon and the Feudal Law of 1765 (vol. 1:103128) through his Plan of Treaties of 1776 (vol. 4:260302) to his experience as a diplomat since 1778. Instead, the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> was the catalyst that brought together the diverse threads of Adams thinking to form a coherent and unified theory regarding the proper course for the foreign policy of the United States that, with few exceptions, he adhered to for the rest of his life.</p>
      <p>Thomas Pownall had extensive, practical experience in colonial administration. Between 1753 and 1760, he served successively as secretary to the governor of New York, lieutenant governor of New Jersey, secretary to the commander in chief of British forces in America, and governor of Massachusetts. As governor of Massachusetts from 1757 to 1760, the climactic years of the French and Indian War, Pownall proved to be an energetic and popular executive. He vigorously prosecuted the war and, in order to gain support for his efforts, courted the popular party. This alienated conservatives, such as Thomas Hutchinson, and ultimately their complaints as well <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0159">[159<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-09/ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0159.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>as the perception in London that Pownall was surrendering executive prerogatives to the assembly led to his recall (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Allen Johnson and Dumas Malone, eds., &lt;i&gt;Dictionary of American Biography&lt;/i&gt;, New York, 19281936; 20 vols. plus index and supplements. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">DAB</span></span>; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Leslie Stephen and Sidney Lee, eds., &lt;i&gt;The Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/i&gt;, New York and London, 18851900; 63 vols. plus supplements. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">DNB</span></span>). Members of Massachusetts popular party lamented Pownalls departure, and John Adams later described him as a friend to liberty and to our constitution, with an aversion to all plots against either (vol. 2:235). Thomas Pownall never again served in America as an administrator, but he drew on his experience there to produce the work for which he is most noted: <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">The Administration of the Colonies</span> (London, 1764, with five revised editions through 1777; Pownall presented Adams with a signed copy of the 1777 edition, <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Catalogue of the John Adams Library in the Public Library of the City of Boston&lt;/i&gt;, Boston, 1917. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Catalogue of <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s Library</span></span>).</p>
      <p>Pownalls <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Administration</span> offered a prescription for solving Britains problems in governing its American empire that was well reasoned and even farsighted. Its roots lay in the Albany Congress of 1754, at which Pownall had become convinced that some sort of colonial union was necessary. By the time he set to work on his <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Administration</span>, Pownall believed that the existing system of colonial administration, unable to deal adequately with the growing economic strength of the colonies, had failed and a crisis existed.</p>
      <p>In <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Administration</span>, Pownall was clear about where he stood. Although he expressed sympathy for the colonists and confidence in their ultimate loyalty to the Crown and empire, which later led him to oppose ministerial efforts at taxation and coercion and even to advocate American seats in the House of Commons, there was no question in Pownalls mind that it was the mother country around whom the colonies revolved and for whose benefit they existed. Great Britain needed a unified system of administration to render the colonies an economic asset rather than a constant drain on its resources. It was the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">precise duty</span> of government at this crisis to take leading measures towards the forming all those Atlantic and American possessions into one Empire of which Great Britain should be the commercial and political center (5th edn., 1774, p. 10).</p>
      <p>The <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial Addressed to the Sovereigns of Europe</span> proceeded directly from <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">The Administration of the Colonies</span>, with much of the text of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>s opening paragraphs taken from the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Administration</span> (No. I, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA09d125n2#PJA09d125n2" class="document">note 2</a>, below). Like the earlier work, the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> sought to resolve the crisis produced by the growing economic importance of North America, that is, the United States. But in his <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>, Pownall proposed that Britain recognize that the colonies were finally and irretrievably lost and had become a sovereign, independent state of great economic potential. Only by adopting the principles of free trade and forming a commercial relationship that would return Anglo-American trade to its normal channels could Britain avoid displacement as an economic power. Finally, since Pownall saw access to the American markets as a European problem, he called for the convening of a council of European nations that would provide for the orderly integration of the new nation into the existing economic and political order by lowering the barriers to free trade and liberalizing the law of nations.</p>
      <p>Pownall cited and quoted from the works of several authors to support <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0160">[160<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-09/ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0160.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>his arguments. His views on the nature and power of the state were based on his reading of Francis Bacons unfinished essay Of the True Greatness of the Kingdom of Britain (No. I, notes <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA09d125n6#PJA09d125n6" class="document">6</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA09d125n9#PJA09d125n9" class="document">9</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA09d125n11#PJA09d125n11" class="document">11</a>, and <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA09d125n21#PJA09d125n21" class="document">21</a>, below). Benjamin Franklin was the source for his statistics on the population and growth of the colonies (same, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA09d125n18#PJA09d125n18" class="document">note 18</a>), while his views on the future course of American foreign policy and the commercial and political relationship between the United States and Europe reflect those of Thomas Paine writing as Common Sense (same, notes <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA09d125n26#PJA09d125n26" class="document">26</a> and <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA09d125n28#PJA09d125n28" class="document">28</a>). On the issue of trade regulation he turned to Sir Matthew Decker (same, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA09d125n50#PJA09d125n50" class="document">note 50</a>); and Henry IVs grand design to unify Europe, as expressed in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memoirs</span> of Maximilien de Bthune, was the model for his plan to achieve a unified European response to the emergence of the United States as an economic power (same, notes <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA09d125n44#PJA09d125n44" class="document">44</a> and <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA09d125n52#PJA09d125n52" class="document">52</a>). But what most sets the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> apart from the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Administration</span>, as well as other works of the period, is the pervasive influence of Adam Smiths <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Wealth of Nations</span> (2 vols., London, 1776). Pownall had given Smiths work an unfavorable review in 1776, largely because at that time he was still a vigorous defender of the colonial monopoly (Thomas Pownall, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">A Letter from Governor Pownall to Adam Smith, LLD, F.R.S. . . .</span>, London, 1776, p. 78, 2627). By 1780 his views had clearly changed, for on page 113 of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> he cites Smith as the source for a quotation, and Smiths influence is evident throughout the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>, not only in those sections dealing with the workings of the economic system and free trade, but also in those touching on the relationship between the colonies and the mother country (No. I, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002&amp;expandNote=PJA09d125n39#PJA09d125n39" class="document">note 39</a>, below).</p>
      <p>John Adams agreed wholeheartedly with much of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>. He could have written those sections dealing with the rise of the United States as an economic and political power, the progress of American civilization, and the new nations determination to trade with all nations while forming political connections with none, and in fact inserted those sections into the letter of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002" class="document">19 April</a> (No. I, below) and the later published versions (<a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0003" class="document">No. II</a>, below) virtually without change. Moreover, when Pownall wrote of the oppressive hand of the church and the nobility on European economic and political development he echoed John Adams own words in the Dissertation on the Canon and the Feudal Law (vol. 1:103128). This likely led Adams to write to Edmund Jenings on <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0116" class="document">20 April</a> (below), requesting that he republish the Dissertation in England.</p>
      <p>But the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> also differed fundamentally from other British proposals for settling the war with America. For the first time a British writer in whom Adams had confidence argued that Great Britains economic self-interest demanded that it make peace and that it do so at once. Previous proposals had all been based on one or more of the following premises: the colonies would be exhausted by the war and sue for peace; the Anglo-American ties of language, religion, and culture would lead the Americans to renounce their French connection and return to the imperial fold; Britain would offer concessions acceptable to the Americans and the war would end. In each case it was assumed that the Americans would see that it was <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0161">[161<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-09/ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0161.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>in their self-interest to make peace because only disaster would result from continuing the war. Pownall, however, rejected those assumptions and argued that by declaring independence the United States had unilaterally repealed the navigation acts and opened its markets to Britains commercial rivals, led by France. If Britain did not act, it risked permanent exclusion from those markets and thus from access to resources of the New World.</p>
      <p>This was similar to Adams thinking when he drafted the Treaty Plan of 1776. He believed then, and continued to believe even after the treaty of alliance was signed, that there was no need to offer France a political alliance because access to American markets formalized in a commercial treaty was incentive enough for French military and financial assistance (Plan of Treaties, 12 June17 Sept. 1776, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-04-02-0116-0001" class="document">Editorial Note</a>, 4:260261). In the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> Adams found Pownall making a similar argument: that access to the American markets was incentive enough to force Britain to seek an immediate peace. The most compelling evidence of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>s influence on John Adams is the fact that this position, as developed and refined by Pownall, formed the core of Adams argument in his rebuttal of Joseph Galloways <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Cool Thoughts</span> in the Letters from a Distinguished American (<a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0312-0001" class="document">[<ins title="editorial addition or explanation" class="ed">ante 1422 July</ins>]</a>, below).</p>
      <p>On only one issue did Adams clearly disagree with Pownall. This was over Pownalls call for the establishment of a council of European powers to resolve the issues raised by the American Revolution. Pownall saw the integration of the New World, with its new found economic and political power, into the existing European system as a crisis that could be resolved only by the agreement of the nations meeting in council. John Adams believed, however, that any problem resulting from the rise of the United States as a political and economic power was Britains alone. The rest of Europe, led by France, was coming or already had come to terms with the new economic and political order. To resolve its problem, Britain needed only to recognize the United States as independent and sovereign, and form a commercial relationship with the new nation. This would bring it into step with the rest of Europe, end its isolation, and make it part of the new economic and political order of which Pownall wrote. Any council of sovereign states dealing even peripherally with political issues or setting conditions by which the United States would be integrated into the European system was unnecessary and even dangerous. This reflected Adams long held belief, ably expressed by Pownall in his <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>, that the United States should seek only commercial, not political, connections with Europe. The only sort of council acceptable to Adams was one that would remove trade barriers, such as the exclusion of foreign ships from the colonial trade in peacetime, or liberalize the law of nations by instituting such principles as free ships make free goods. John Adams, therefore, drastically revised the portion of Pownalls <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> that called for a European council.</p>
      <p>John Adams first learned of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> from Thomas Digges letter of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0084" class="document">6 April</a> (above, but see also Edmund Jenings letter of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0044" class="document">19 March</a>, and <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0044&amp;expandNote=PJA09d047n3#PJA09d047n3" class="document">note 3</a>, above), in which Digges identified Pownall as the author. Digges also <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0162">[162<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-09/ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0162.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>indicated that he was sending a copy of the pamphlet to Benjamin Franklin, with a request that it be passed on to Adams when Franklin was finished Digges to Franklin, (6 April, <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Letters of Thomas Attwood Digges&lt;/i&gt;, ed. Robert H. Elias and Eugene D. Finch, Columbia, S.C., 1982. ]">Digges, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Letters</span></span>, p. 185189). It seems likely, from Adams reply of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0104" class="document">15 April</a> (above), that both letters of 6 April had arrived and that soon thereafter Adams borrowed the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> from Franklin, read it, and set to work, condensing Pownalls 127-page text to about half its size in just four days. This despite the fact that between 15 and 19 April, Adams wrote ten letters, four of them to the president of Congress, including that of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0111" class="document">18 April</a> in which the influence of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> is clearly evident (No. 48, and <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0111&amp;expandNote=PJA09d119n1#PJA09d119n1" class="document">note 1</a>, above). There is no evidence that when Adams wrote his letter to the president, he had any plans to publish his text, although considering the time and effort he spent on it, such a thought may have been in the back of his mind.</p>
      <p>The task of revising Pownalls <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> was daunting, even if one considers only the time spent copying and recopying the text, not to mention the substantive textual changes that Adams made. The effort was necessary, however, because while Adams saw Pownalls arguments as important, he believed that the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>s turgid and idiosyncratic prose obscured them and diminished their impact. The letter to the president of Congress (<a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002" class="document">No. I</a>, below) fills thirteen closely written pages. The points at which Adams omitted significant blocks of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>s text or made substantive changes in Pownalls prose are indicated in the notes. John Adams Letterbook copy in John Thaxters hand (<span class="ref-terms">Adams Papers</span>) fills thirty-four pages and is identical to the recipients copy except for Thaxters copying errors and some insertions by Adams to correct them. No draft has been found and John Adams may have composed the letter to Congress directly from the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>.</p>
      <p>In early July, John Adams decided to publish his revision of Pownalls <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>. Using his Letterbook copy, he reworked and revised the manuscript (<a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0003" class="document">No. II</a>, below) to produce a shorter and more clearly focused version. This became the text that appeared as <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penses</span> and <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Translation of the Memorial</span>. Adams removed material that he, upon reconsideration, thought extraneous or, in the case of Pownalls proposal for a European council, to more sharply emphasize his argument at the expense of Pownalls. It is noteworthy that Pownalls references to the new World, which were retained in the letter, became America in the manuscript and instead of North America being a new <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">primary planet</span>, it was the Congress of the United States of North America, that filled that role.</p>
      <p>John Adams made two copies of the text that were ultimately published, but only that sent to Edmund Jenings has survived. A second copy sent by Adams to M. Addenet, a Parisian translator, has not been found, nor has the manuscript of Addenets French translation that Jean Luzac used for <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penses</span>. The surviving manuscript consists of five parts, each separately titled, that together fill nineteen pages. Edmund Jenings received the first four with Adams letter of 8 July (<span class="ref-terms">Adams Papers</span>), while the fifth likely was enclosed in Adams letter of the <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0313" class="document">14th</a> (below; but see Jenings replies of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0318" class="document">15</a><span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0163">[163<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-09/ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0163.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>and <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-10-02-0012" class="document">21</a> July, both below). The manuscript, which Jenings sent off to London in mid-September (from Jenings, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-10-02-0079" class="document">14 Sept.</a>, below), contains emendations made by Jenings as he prepared it for publication and which appear in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Translation</span> as published at London in 1781. These changes, which were editorial rather than substantive, do not appear in the text printed in this volume. Moreover, a comparison of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penses</span> with the manuscript indicates that the copy sent to Addenet was probably identical, with one possible exception indicated in the notes, to that sent to Jenings.</p>
      <p>The only significant difference between the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penses</span> and the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Translation</span>, other than that imposed by language, was Jean Luzacs twenty-page preface. John Adams sent Luzac the manuscript in French translation on 5 Sept. and asked for his opinion (to Luzac, <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-10-02-0066" class="document">5 Sept.</a>, below). Luzac replied that the work had great merit, but suggested that he act as editor and introduce the text with a preface designed to allay Dutch fears of an American threat to their commercial interests that might be aroused by the pamphlets focus on the economic potential of the United States (see Luzacs letter of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-10-02-0080-0002" class="document">14 Sept.</a> and <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Adams (17351826) ]">JA</abbr>s reply of the <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-10-02-0081" class="document">15th</a>, both below). <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penses</span> was published at Amsterdam in November 1780.</p>
      <p>Historians have virtually ignored John Adams Translation of Thomas Pownalls <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> and, indeed, have paid little attention to the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> itself. This has been due partly to a lack of information regarding both Adams letter to the president of Congress and its later printed versions as well as to a thorough misunderstanding over the degree to which Adams pamphlet differed from the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>. The letter has been available only in the Papers of the Continental Congress or in the Adams Papers, and few libraries hold the original pamphlets. Francis Wharton did not include the letter of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002" class="document">19 April</a> in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States</span>, and Charles Francis Adams printed neither the letter nor the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Translation</span> in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Works of John Adams</span>. Moreover, after their publication in 1780 and 1781 respectively, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penses</span> and the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Translation</span> were not republished in Europe and there were no American editions.</p>
      <p>John Adams, himself, did not inform Congress that the substance of his letter of <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002" class="document">19 April</a> had been published; nor is there any indication that he informed anyone of his effort to have Jenings publish the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Translation</span> in London or of the publication itself. Indeed, Adams authorship of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Translation</span> remains unrecognized, it being generally attributed to Edmund Jenings or even, in a contemporary review of the pamphlet in Londons <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Monthly Review</span> (64 [1781]:150), to Benjamin Franklin.</p>
      <p>John Adams freely acknowledged his authorship of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penses</span> and widely distributed copies of it in the Netherlands. But over time, Adams authorship of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penses</span> was forgotten (see <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Leslie Stephen and Sidney Lee, eds., &lt;i&gt;The Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/i&gt;, New York and London, 18851900; 63 vols. plus supplements. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">DNB</span></span>, 16:267). The lack of attention has been all the more unfortunate because there is no better source for John Adams views on the rise of the United States as an economic and political power, the future conduct of American foreign policy, or his thoughts regarding an Anglo-American peace than this work.</p>
      <p>Some explanation of the editorial treatment of the two documents pre-<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0164">[164<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=ADMS/Pages/ADMS-06-09/ADMS-06-09-02-pb-0164.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>sented below seems in order. The <a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0002" class="document">19 April</a> letter to the president of Congress (No. I, below) is more extensively annotated than John Adams Translation of Thomas Pownalls <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> (<a href="default.xqy?keys=ADMS-print-06-09-02-0115-0003" class="document">No. II</a>, below). The notes to the letter deal with Adams copying from the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span> and seek to shed light on his decisions to include, exclude, or alter particular sections. They also consider Pownalls sources, translate Latin and French passages, and indicate major blocks of material in the letter that Adams deleted when he copied out his Translation of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Memorial</span>. Because it is virtually identical to the published <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Translation</span>, the annotation of the manuscript has been limited to matters unique to that document.</p>
