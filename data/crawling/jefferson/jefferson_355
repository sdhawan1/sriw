<p>Whereas the various and vague claims to unpattented Lands under the former Government,<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-02-0054-fn-0001" id="TSJN-01-02-0054-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> covering the greater part of the Country on the Western Waters, may produce tedious and infinite Litigation and disputes, and in the mean time Purchasers would be discouraged from taking up Lands upon the Terms lately prescribed by Law, whereby the Fund to be raised in Aid of the Taxes for discharging the Public Debt would be in a great measure, frustrated; And it is just and necessary, as well for the peace of Individuals, as for the Public Weal, that some certain Rules should be Established for setling and determining the Rights to such Lands, and fixing the Principles upon which such Claimers shall be entitled to Patents;<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-02-0054-fn-0002" id="TSJN-01-02-0054-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> to the End that subsequent Purchasers and Adventurers may be enabled to Act<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-02-0054-fn-0003" id="TSJN-01-02-0054-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> with greater Certainty and Safety.
