Text of Act as adopted is in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W. Hening, &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; ]">Hening,</span> <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">x</span>, 937.</p>


   <p>This Bill was enacted as a separate law in 1779, which was substantially a restatement of the Act of Oct. 1778, but omitted its preamble. That preamble asserted that many counterfeiters of paper currency had escaped punishment and this alarming evil daily increases and is become so enormous that the most fatal consequences are justly to be apprehended. The Act of Oct. 1778 also, like Bill No. 65, sought to provide remedies for the situation whereby the unalienable privilege of trial by a jury of the vicinage, has, from the manner of summoning such juries, been abused (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W. Hening, &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; ]">Hening,</span> <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ix</span>, 541). On 23 May 1779 a Bill was ordered drawn up to guard against counterfeiting and a committee was appointed for that purpose; the next day TJ was added to the committee. The Bill was introduced on 26 May, amended by both House and Senate; House accepted Senates amendments 18 June (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, May 1779, 1827 edn., p. 18, 22, 23, 44, 46, 53, 55, 62). This Bill, as originally contemplated, was probably intended only for the limited purpose indicated and summarized in the notes below. The addition of TJ to the committee suggests that he enlarged this purpose by inserting the Committee of Revisors Bill No. 65 in the middle of the one being prepared, for this is the position that it occupies in the Act as adopted, being preceded by the part summarized in note 1 and followed by that summarized in note 2. In any case, Bill No. 65 was thus adopted without alteration.</p>


   <p>Bill No. 65 was presented by Madison 31 Oct. 1785, postponed 14 Dec. to next <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0510">[510<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0510.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> session, and brought up again 1 Nov. 1786; but, since the Act of 1779 was still in force, no further action was taken upon it (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1785, 1828 edn., p. 1215, 92; Oct. 1786, 1828 edn., p. 1617).</p>

   <p>Preceding this point the Act as adopted has a section making it a felony without benefit of clergy to steal any bill of credit, treasury note, loan office certificate of the United States or of any other state, warrant of the governor, auditors certificate; or to present such loan certificates at any United States loan office when such certificates were known to have been stolen (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W.

   <p>Following this point the Act as adopted has a section authorizing the auditors to grant certificates to all witnesses, veniremen, and sheriffs for their attendance on criminal cases (allowing two shillings per mile for travel and 4 per day for attendance); and repealing the Act of Oct. 1778 for more effectually guarding against counterfeiting of the bills of credit, treasury notes, and loan office certificates (same, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ix</span>, 5415).</p>
