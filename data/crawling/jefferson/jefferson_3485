        <p>Article 4th. It is agreed that creditors on either side shall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in sterling money, of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted.</p>
        <p>Article 5th.

And that persons of any other description shall have free liberty to go to any part or parts of any of the thirteen United States, and therein to remain twelve months unmolested in their endeavours to obtain the restitution of such of their estates, rights and properties, as may have been confiscated; and that Congress shall also earnestly recommend to the several states a reconsideration and revision of all acts or laws regarding the premises, so as to render the said laws or acts perfectly consistent, not only with justice and equity, but with that spirit of conciliation, which on the return of the blessings of peace should universally prevail. And that Congress shall also earnestly recommend to the several states, that the estates, rights and properties of such last mentioned persons shall be restored to them, they refunding to any persons who may be now in possession of the bona fide price (where any has been given) which such persons may have paid on purchasing any of the said lands, rights or properties since the confiscation. And it is agreed that all persons who have any interest in confiscated lands, either by debts, marriage settlements, or otherwise, shall meet with no lawful impediment in the prosecution of their just rights.</p>

        <p>Article 7th. There shall be a firm and perpetual peace between his Britannic majesty and the said states, and between the subjects of the one, and the citizens of the other, wherefore all hostilities both by sea and land, shall from henceforth cease; all prisoners on both sides shall be set at liberty, and his Britannic majesty shall with all convenient speed, and without causing any destruction, or carrying away any negroes or other property of the American inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, garrisons and fleets from the said United States, and from every post, place and harbour within the same; leaving in all fortifications the American artillery that may be therein, and shall also order and cause all archives, records, deeds and papers, belonging to any of the said states, or their citizens, which in the course of the war may have fallen into the hands of his officers, to be forthwith restored and delivered to the proper states and persons to whom they belong.</p>

          <p>On 13 Jan. 1784 the delegates from Connecticut and New Jersey presented their credentials. On the following day, nine states being present, Congress took up the report of the committee consisting of TJ, Gerry, Ellery, Read, and Hawkins that had been appointed 13 Dec. 1783 and to whom were referred the Joint letter of Ministers at Paris 10 Sept. 1783 and definitive treaty signed 3 Sept. To prepare a form of ratification (Committee Book, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>: <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>, No. 186). The committee had reported on 16 Dec.; hence TJs draft of the resolution and form of ratification were drawn up between 13 and 16 Dec. 1783 (same; the Journals do not record the appointment of the committee or the date of report).</p>
          <p>As indicated in note 1, Col. Josiah Harmar was immediately designated to carry the Treaty to Europe. Next day it was moved that a triplicate of the ratification be sent by Lt. Col. David S. Franks, who is authorized and directed to take passage in the first vessel which shall sail from any port eastward of Philadelphia, for France or any port in the channel, in which neither of the instruments of the ratification, already forwarded, may be sent, provided such vessel shall sail before the 3 day of February next; the resolution also provided that the Superintendant of finance furnish Lieutenant Colonel D. S. Franks, with money to defray his necessary expences in going and returning (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.

But this motion was lost, and another, moved by Gerry and seconded by TJ, to refer to a committee the question of considering the most expeditious mode of sending a triplicate was referred to the three delegates (Wadsworth, McComb, and Lee) who had voted against the motion to send Franks. They reported at once that it having been signified to the house that Major [<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>] David S. Franks is desirous of going to France on his own affairs, he be requested to take into his care the ratification of the D.T. and deliver it to our Ministers at <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0462">[462<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-06/TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0462.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> Paris and that he be supplied with one hundred guineas for his extraordinary expense in so doing. This report was written by Lee, and was adopted, though another, evidently introduced by Samuel Osgood to provide for Franks necessary expences, was evidently offered as a substitute, as still another by James Monroe providing for 200 guineas to enable Franks to bear his expences; Arthur Lee also apparently introduced a resolution requiring that certified copies of the ratification be sent by express to the governors of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island with the request that they forward the same by the first vessel sailing from any port in their respective states (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.

Franks and Harmar were delayed by the severity of the winter; Franks arrived in London on 7 April and the next day set off for Paris. The exchange of ratifications took place on 13 May 1784 (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Va.

That part of TJs draft resolution which was deleted became two as adopted on 14 Jan. 1784: that the ratification be transmitted with all possible despatch, under the care of a faithful person, to our ministers in France, who have negotiated the treaty, to be exchanged and that Colonel Josiah Harmar be appointed to carry the said ratification (same, p. 29; both resolutions, as revised, are in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>: <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>, No. 36, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ii</span>, and are stated in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.
