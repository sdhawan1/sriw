And therefore that all purchases and Deeds from any Indian or Indians or from any Indian Nation or Nations for any Lands within any part of the said Territory which have been or shall be made for the Use and Benefit of any private Person or persons whatsoever, And Royal Grants within the ceded Territory inconsistent with the Chartered Rights Laws and Customs of Virginia, shall be deemed and declared absolutely void and of no Effect in the same Manner as if the said Territory had still remained subject to and part of the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>
<p>That all the remaining Territory of Virginia included between the Atlantic Ocean and the South East Side of the River Ohio and the Maryland Pensylvania and North Carolina Boundaries shall be guaranteed to the Commonwealth of Virginia by the said United States.</p>

<p>It seems ironic that the transmittal of the General Assemblys resolution upon which the Happiness, Strength and safety of the United States depended should have been delayed a fortnight because the enemy had entered the capital of Virginia and had put the government to flight. Indeed, it appeared to be almost by chance that this crucial resolution was drafted and adopted before Arnolds dragoons arrived in Richmond. The resolution of Congress of 6 Sep., transmitted <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-03-02-0722" class="document">to TJ by Samuel Huntington in his letter of 10 Sep.</a> (q.v., with references and notes there), was presumably included in the letters and documents sent by TJ to Benjamin Harrison, speaker of the House of Delegates, early in November (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-04-02-0120" class="document">TJ to Harrison under date of 7 Nov. 1780</a>). Not much legislation engaged the attention of that body during November and December, some of it of great importance and some fairly trivial. The House had been delayed several days at the opening of the session because of lack of a quorum, and toward the end of December absences threatened to disrupt legislative business. On Saturday, 23 Dec., the sergeant-at-arms was ordered to take into custody no fewer than forty-five members and at the same time the House resolved that it would with all the severity of censure, publish the names of members who shall absent themselves in future, from their duty in the House at this critical juncture, without leave; that the calamities which will probably ensue upon leaving our affairs deranged, may be attributed to the authors of them. However, it was not until 1 Jan. that the House finally resolved itself into a committee of the whole to discuss the subject brought up in Congress resolution. The next day, in the midst of alarms about the approach of an enemy fleet in Virginia waters, the resolution printed above was hastily approved. The Senate concurred immediately and both houses adjourned forthwith (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1780, 1827 edn., p. 10, 67, 79, 80, 81). Since, from this brief outline, it appears that no special committee was directed to draft the resolution, some member must have had a draft ready to present in the closing hours of the session. TJ had been much concerned with the northwest in the preceding days (see his <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-04-02-0295" class="document">letter to George Rogers Clark of 25 Dec. 1780</a>). These facts, together with TJs work in Congress in 17831784 on the same subject, seem to reinforce the conjecture stated below that TJ may have had a hand in drafting the resolution.</p>
 <p>While the conditions stated in the resolution were, as the Virginia delegates affirmed, not precisely conformable to the recommendations of Congress on the subject (see their <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-04-02-0590" class="document">letter to TJ, 30 Jan. 1781</a>), Congress did not hesitate to put the Articles of Confederation into force early in 1781. Virginia had already ratified the Articles in 1777 and her delegates had subscribed their names to the engrossed parchment (see above, Vol. 1: 11112; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1777, 1827 edn., p. 801; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789&lt;/i&gt;, ed. W. C. Ford and others, Washington, 19041937 ]">JCC</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xix</span>, 223). Maryland on 2 Feb. 1781 authorized her delegates to sign. The Act of authorization was read in Congress 12 Feb. On 1 Mch., when John Hanson and Daniel Carroll signed for Maryland, this was regarded by Congress as the act by which  the Confederation of the United States of America was completed (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

Yet, three years later, there was doubt as to whether Congress would accept the terms on which Virginia had predicated her cession of lands northwest of the Ohio. On 13 Sep. 1783 Congress stipulated the terms on which Virginias conditional cession of 2 Jan. 1781 would be accepted; the General Assembly at its session of Oct. 1783 authorized the Virginia delegates in Congress to execute a deed of cession accordingly; TJ himself, as a member of Congress, drafted the deed of cession of 1 Mch. 1784. <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-07-02-0005" class="document">TJs letter of 3 Mch. 1784 to Benjamin Harrison</a> is a cogent analysis of the tactics required of the Virginia delegates even at that date to obtain acceptance by Congress (see <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W.

Whether or not this indicates that TJ had any influence in drafting the resolution, there are the following facts to be noted. First, in respect to the requirement that Virginia should be reimbursed for <a id="TSJN-01-04-0485-kw-0002" class="keywordref" title="jump to expences in reducing the British posts in text" href="#TSJN-01-04-0485-ks-0001">expences in reducing the British posts</a>, there is a document in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>: TJ Papers in TJs hand that may possibly relate to, or have been drawn up to be inserted in, some document concerning Virginias claim to western lands, possibly even the present resolution. It reads as follows: A judicious state of our right to the lands we claim, comprehending the progression of grants and settlements under the government of Virginia from at least the period or some time before the Lancaster treaty [1744] shewing the expence we have been at from time to time in treaties with the Indians and protecting the Frontier and the extent of our exercising jurisdiction in that country down to the time of the revolution when Independance was declared, will serve &amp;ca. Since this fragment is embraced by quotation marks, TJ may, of course, have copied it from some other document. Second, the requirement that the French and Canadian settlers of the Northwest should be confirmed in their possessions and title and protected in the Enjoyment of their Rights and Liberty closely parallels the final part of the instructions given by TJ to George Rogers Clark (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-04-02-0295" class="document">TJ to Clark, 25 Dec. 1780</a>).</p></div>

Hening notes this omission in one of the texts subsequently derived from <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ transcript ]">Tr</abbr> (1) and, in printing the text of the resolution described as Copy sent the Governor 15th January, makes the following comment: It is most obvious that, in transcribing the resolution, or in some copy of the subsequent proceedings founded on it, the words and upon their own state establishment, were inadvertently omitted by the clerk. For it cannot be presumed that the state of Virginia, who had by several solemn acts of the legislature, declared that the bounties in land given to the officers and soldiers of the Virginia line on continental establishment, should be extended to those on state establishment, would make provision for the one class, in ceded territory, and omit the other. Nor is it within the bounds of probability that, while Virginia was <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">giving</span> away such an extensive territory to the United States she should not so have <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">disposed of the gift</span>, as to do complete justice to her own citizens (x, 565). In his next volume, Hening modified this opinion. From a line by line printing of the pertinent passage in the original manuscript (presumably the engrossed copy), he proved that the omission was made in the first copy sent to the governor and not in some subsequent proceedings founded on it (same, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xi</span>, 5667). This, of course, is correct, but it is an explanation that invites comment. For the text that TJ transmitted to Congress set in motion an error that could not be reversed. When, a year and a half later, Congress adopted its resolve of 13 Sep. 1783 and embodied in it the text of the resolution of 2 Jan. 1781, that body was legally bound to employ the officially attested text that TJ had sent, not the correct text that, for some reason or other, was at that time in Congress records. Similarly, when Congress resolve of 13 Sep. 1783 was laid before the Virginia General Assembly, the Assembly in turn was legally obligated to recite, in its Act passed at the Oct. 1783 session, the inaccurate version that Congress had employed. But this was not the completion of the circle. When TJ, then a member of Congress, received Virginias Act of 1783 authorizing the delegates in Congress to execute a deed of cession, the two drafts of a form of deed that he drew up specified that the Virginia Act should be copied verbatimas, indeed, he was bound to do. Once TJ had transmitted the erroneous but officially attested copy <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-04-02-0481" class="document">to Huntington on 17 Jan. 1781</a>, the error could not be overtaken even if noticed. On Monday, 1 Mch. 1784, the Virginia delegates signed, sealed, and delivered the deed of cession in which was imbedded the defective text and Congress directed that the same be recorded and enrolled among the acts of the United States. Thus John Beckleys error was made perpetual. It still stands, protected in <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-04-02-pb-0391">[391<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-04/TSJN-01-04-02-pb-0391.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> its unassailable legal position and enshrined in one of the most important series of Acts that the Virginia General Assembly or the Continental Congress adopted at that period (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W.
