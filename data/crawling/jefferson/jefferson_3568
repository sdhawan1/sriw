          <p>That such temporary government shall only continue in force in any state until it shall have acquired 20.000. free inhabitants; when giving due proof thereof to Congress, they shall receive from them authority with appointments of time and place to call a Convention of representatives to establish a permanent constitution and government for themselves.</p>
          <p>Provided that both the temporary and permanent governments be established on these principles as their basis. 1.

Provided the consent of nine states to such admission may be obtained according to the eleventh of the articles of Confederation. Until such admission by their delegates into Congress, any of the said states, after the establishment of their temporary government, shall have authority to keep a sitting member in Congress, with a right of debating, but not of voting.</p>

            <p>This word altered to and in the broadside text to conform with the changes described in notes 5 and 7.</p></div>

            <p>At this point TJ added the following in the margin of the printed text: whatsoever may be its comprehension of latitude. That which may lie between the Ohio and completion of the 39th degree within the said meridians shall make part of the state adjoining on the north &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">of that latitude</span>&gt; &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">degree</span>&gt;.

In the right-hand margin of the printed text, imbedded in and therefore written prior to the alteration described in note 9, there is in TJs hand an alteration corresponding with that made by Howell in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr>; but in the left-hand margin of the printed text, also in TJs hand, is the following: on any territory which may have been so purchased and offered for sale. The latter, except for the deletion of the words which may have been, is the reading employed by TJ in the revised report; this alteration thus bears a relationship to that described in note 2, and, for the reason there given, probably was made in committee rather than in Congress.</p></div>
          <div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-06-0447-fn-0011-ptr" id="TSJN-01-06-0447-fn-0011">11</a>
            <p>In printed text this word is deleted in part to read the. This alteration, however, was not incorporated by TJ in the revised report.</p></div>

            <p>This phrase altered by interlineation in printed text to read: the original states.</p></div>

            <p>At this point TJ inserted a caret in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> and interlined the following: and confederated with. The interlined words, however, are faint and appear to have been erased; they are not in the printed text; see note 12, Document IV.</p></div>

            <p>The initial letter of the first word in this and the succeeding clause are capitalized in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> by Howell, who was also evidently responsible for inserting in the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> a large number of commas. These alterations may suggest that Howell had the duty of overseeing the printing of the report.</p></div>

            <p>The text of the broadside reads states, but the final letter is deleted by a mark, indicating that this was a typographical error; but it was not corrected when the type was corrected for the printing of the revised report.</p></div>

            <p>At this point in the broadside a caret is inserted and the following is written opposite in the margin: provided nine states agree to such admission &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">as is req</span>&gt; according to the reservation of the 11th of the Arts. of Confedn. And in order [to] &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">accommodate</span>&gt; adapt the said Articles of Confedn. to the state of Congress when its numbers shall be thus increased, it shall [be] proposed to the legislatures of the states originally parties [there]to to require the assent of [two thirds of the] U.S. in C. ass. in all those [cases] wherein by the Articles the assent of 9. states is now required, which being agreed to by them shall be binding on the new states. Until such admission &amp;c. This amendment, which was incorporated in the revised report, called for the deletion of the remainder of the sentence and all of the next sentence following the caret (after which the assent of two thirds  of the articles of Confederation) but there is no indication on the broadside of such deletion.</p></div>

            <p>The broadside has a caret inserted at this point and the following written opposite in the margin: and which shall be bounded on the south by the Ohio, whatsoever latitudes it may include, shall be called. This alteration shows that, even after the report had been printed and perhaps as an amendment offered in Congress, the southern boundary of Saratoga was changed to make it agree with what TJ represented in the Jefferson-Hartley map.</p></div>
          <div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-06-0447-fn-0022-ptr" id="TSJN-01-06-0447-fn-0022">22</a>
            <p>This word in the broadside is enclosed in rectangular lines; see note 25.</p></div>
          <div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-06-0447-fn-0023-ptr" id="TSJN-01-06-0447-fn-0023">23</a>
            <p>The preceding four words in the printed text are enclosed in rectangular lines; see note 25.</p></div>
          <div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-06-0447-fn-0024-ptr" id="TSJN-01-06-0447-fn-0024">24</a>
            <p>At this point in the printed text a caret is inserted and in the margin is written the single word territory.</p></div>
          <div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-06-0447-fn-0025-ptr" id="TSJN-01-06-0447-fn-0025">25</a>
            <p>The final clause of this paragraph in the broadside is enclosed in rectangular lines; this and the preceding four paragraphs (beginning That the territory Northward of the 45th degree, &amp;c.) also have a vertical line drawn through them to indicate that they were to be deleted, as was, of course, done by amendment in Congress. But these rectangular enclosures in the final paragraph, as well as the changes indicated in notes 21 and 24, reveal a significant fact about the progress of the report through Congress that evidently has not been noted in previous accounts. If the words so enclosed as noted here and in notes 22 and 23 are eliminated from the paragraph, it reads as follows: The territory which lies under the 39th. and 38th. degrees to which shall be added so much of the point of land within the fork of the Ohio and Missisipi as lies under the 37th degree, within and adjacent to which are the confluences of the rivers Wabash, Shawanee, Tanissee, Ohio, Illinois, Missisipi and Missouri, shall be called Polypotamia. In other words, during the debates in Congress the name of the proposed state of Pelisipia was eliminated from the group of ten proposed to be named in the Ordinance by TJ. The obvious inference is that, at least for a time, Congress considered retaining nine of the names but later deleted all of them.</p></div>
