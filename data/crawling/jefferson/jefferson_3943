<p>On my arrival here I found that Mr. Short had passed through on his way to N. York and was there at the date of my last. I regret much that I missed the pleasure of seeing him. The inclosed was put into my hands by Mrs. House, who received it after he left Philada. My two last, neither of which were in cypher, were written as will be all future ones in the same situation, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">in</span><a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0365-fn-0001" id="TSJN-01-07-0365-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">expectation of their being read by the postmasters</span>. I am well assured that this is the fate of all letters at least to <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">and from public persons</span> not only in <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">France but all the other Countries of Europe</span>. Having now the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">use of my cypher I can write without restraint</span>. In my last I gave you a sketch of what past at <a href="#TSJN-01-07-0365-kw-0004" title="[explained in note]" id="TSJN-01-07-0365-ks-0001" class="keyword">Fort Schuyler</a> during my stay there, mentioning in particular that the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Marquis had made a speech to the Indians with the sanction of the Commissioners, Wolcot, Lee, Butler</span>. The question will probably occur how <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">a foreigner and a private one, could appear on the theatre of a public treaty</span> between <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0445">[445<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0445.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">United States and the Indian nations and how the Commissioners could lend a sanction to it</span>. <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Instead of offering an opinion of the measure</span> I will state the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">manner in which it was brought about</span>. It seems that most of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Indian tribes</span> particularly <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">those of the Iroquois retain a strong predilection for the French and most of the latter an enthusiastic idea of the marquis</span>. This idea has resulted from <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">his being a Frenchman, the</span> figure <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">he has made during the war</span> and the arrival of several important <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">events which he foretold to</span> them soon after <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">he came to this country</span>. Before <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">he went to Fort Schuyler</span> it had been suggested, either in <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">compliment or sincerity</span> that his <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">presence and influence might be of material service to the treaty. At Albany the same thing had been said to him by general Wolcot</span>. On <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">his arrival at Fort S. Mr. Kirkland</span> recommended an exertion of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">his influence as of essential consequence to the treaty</span>, painting in the strongest colours the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">attachment of the</span> Indians <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">to his person</span>, which seemed indeed to be <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">verified by their caresses</span> and the artifices employed by the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">British partizans to frustrate the objects of the treaty</span>, among which was a pretext that the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">alliance between the United States and France was insincere and transitory</span> and consequently the respect of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">the Indians for the later ought to be no motive for their respecting the former</span>. Upon these <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">circumstances the M. grounded a written message to the Commissioners before they got up</span> intimating <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">his disposition to render the United States any service his small</span> influence <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">over the Indians</span> might <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">put in his power and desiring to know</span> what <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">the Commissioners would chuse him to say</span>. The <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">answer in Mr. Lees hand</span> consisted of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">polite acknowledgments</span> and information that the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Commissioners would be happy in affording him an opportunity of saying what ever he might wish forbearing to advise or suggest what it would be best for him to say. The M. perceived the caution but imputed it to Lee alone. As his stay</span> however <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">was to be very short it was necessary for him to take provisional measures</span> before <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">the arrival of the commissioners</span> and particularly for <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">calling in the Oneida Cheifs who were at their town</span>. It fell <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">to my lot to be consulted in his dilemma</span>. My <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">advice was that he should invite the chiefs in such a way as would give him an opportunity of addressing them publicly</span>, if on a <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">personal interview with the Commissioners</span> it should be judged expedient; or <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">of satisfying their expectations with a friendly entertainment in return for the civilities his visit to their town</span> had met with. This <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">advice was approved</span>; but the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Indians</span> brought with <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">them such ideas of his importance as</span> no <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">private reception</span> would <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">probably have been equal to</span>. When <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">the Commissioners arrived the <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0446">[446<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0446.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> M. consulted them in person</span>. They were <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">reserved, he was embarrassed</span>. Finally <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">they changed their plan</span> and <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">concurred</span> explicitly <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">in his making a Speech in form</span>. He accordingly <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">prepared one, communicated it to the Commissioners</span> and <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">publicly pronounced it, the Commissioners premising</span> such an one as was thought proper <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">to introduce his</span>. The <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">answer of the sachems</span>, as well as the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">circumstances of the audience</span> denoted the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">highest reverence for the orator</span>. The cheif of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">the Oneidas said</span> that the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">words which he had spoken to them early in the war</span> had <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">prevented them from being misled to the wrong side of it</span>. During this <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">scene</span> and even during <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">the whole stay of the M. he was the only conspicuous figure</span>. The <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Commissioners were eclipsed</span>. All of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">them probably felt it. Lee complained to me of the</span> immoderate <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">stress laid on the</span> influence <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">of the M.</span>, and evidently <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">promoted his departure</span>. The <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">M. was not insensible of it, but consoled himself with the service</span> which <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">he thought the Indian speech</span> would witness that <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">he had rendered to the United States</span>. I am persuaded that the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">transaction</span> is also <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">pleasing to him in another view as</span> it will <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">form <a href="#TSJN-01-07-0365-kw-0002" title="[explained in note]" id="TSJN-01-07-0365-ks-0902" class="keyword">a bright column in the gazettes of Europe</a></span>, and that <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">he will be impatient for its appearance there</span> without seeing <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">any mode in</span> which <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">it can happen of course</span>.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0365-fn-0002" id="TSJN-01-07-0365-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> As it is <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">blended with the proceedings of the Commissioners</span>, it will probably <a href="#TSJN-01-07-0365-kw-0001" title="[explained in note]" id="TSJN-01-07-0365-ks-0901" class="keyword">not be <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">published in America very soon, if at all</span></a><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0365-fn-0003" id="TSJN-01-07-0365-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> The</span> time I have lately <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">passed with the M. has given me a</span> pretty thorough <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">insight into his character</span>. With great <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">natural frankness of temper he unites much address</span>; with very <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">considerable talents, a</span> strong <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">thirst of praise and popularity</span>.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0365-fn-0004" id="TSJN-01-07-0365-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> In <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">his politics he</span> says <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">his three hobby-horses</span> are the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">alliance between France and the United States</span>, the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Union of the latter</span> and the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">manumission</span> of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">slaves</span>. The two former are the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">dearer to him as they are connected</span> with <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">his personal glory</span>. The last <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">does him real honor</span>, as it is a <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">proof of his humanity</span>. In a word, I take <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">him to be as amiable a man</span> as <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">his vanity will admit</span>,<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0365-fn-0005" id="TSJN-01-07-0365-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> and as <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">sincere an American as any Frenchman can be</span>; one <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">whose past services gratitude obliges us to acknowledge and whose future friendship</span> prudence <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">requires us to cultivate</span>.</p>
<p>The Committee of the States have never reassembled. The case of Longchamps has been left both by the Legislature and Executive of this State to its Judiciary course. He is sentenced to a fine of 100 Crowns, to 2 years imprisonment, and Security for good behaviour for 7 years. On teusday morning I set off for Richmond, where I ought to be tomorrow, but some delays have put it out of my power. The ramble I have taken has rather inflamed than extinguished my curiosity to see the Northern and N.W. Country. <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0447">[447<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0447.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> If circumstances be favorable I may probably resume it next Summer. Present my compliments to Miss Patsy, for whom as well as yourself Mrs. House charges me with hers. She has lately received a letter from poor Mrs. Trist, every syllable of which is the language of affliction itself. She had arrived safe at the habitation of her deceased husband, but will not be able to leave that Country till the Spring at the nearest. The only happiness she says she is capable of there is to receive proofs that her friends have not forgotten her. I do not learn what is likely to be the amount of the effects left by Mr. T. Former accounts varied from 6 to 10,000 dollars. I am Dear Sir Yrs. very affectly.,</p>

<p>The best account of Lafayettes dramatic appearance before the Indian conference is to be found in Gottschalk, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Lafayette</span>, 178389, p. 96108.

As indicated in <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-07-02-0340" class="document">Madisons letter to TJ of 11 Oct. 1784</a>, Marbois had been so busy transcribing the proceedings of the treaty that Madison was unable to see the originals in order to make copies for TJ. Somehow, probably from Marbois or even from Lafayette himself (though possibly from the Rev. Dr. Samuel Kirkland, missionary to the Oneidas and secretary of the conference), St. John de Crvecur obtained copies of Lafayettes speech and the Indians replies and published them in <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penna.  Packet</span>, 17 and 19 Nov. 1784, whence they were copied by other newspapers (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penna.

Courant</span>, 30 Nov. 1784; <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Mass. Centinel</span>, 29 Nov. and 1 Dec. 1784). Lafayette, embarrassed or pretending to be embarrassed by the publication of this account before an official report had been made by the commissioners, apologized to Congress (Gottschalk, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Lafayette</span>, 178389, p. 107, 1289). He wrote a protest to Crvecur who published a note to the effect that the speeches had been printed without Lafayettes knowledge (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penna. Packet</span>, 11 Dec. 1784; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/i&gt;, 17741789, ed.

<p>Lafayettes concern was needless and, as Gottschalk suggests, may have been feigned. His speech was actually made before the serious negotiations of the treaty got under way, though it was, of course, made after the commissioners arrived and with their somewhat reluctant permissionthe more reluctant because under the circumstances of Lafayettes early arrival and the Indians attitude it could not have been denied. The treaty as reported to Congress and as published officially in 1785 contained neither the commissioners nor Lafayettes speeches, and consisted only of the terms agreed upon with the Six Nations (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/i&gt;, 17741789, ed.

The commissioners felt an understandable resentment at being eclipsed by the glamorous figure of the marquis who, despite his having been adopted by the Iroquois in 1778 with the name <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Kayewla</span>, was only a private figure at the treaty. But there is no reason to suppose that their failure to include speeches in their report of the treaty was based on such grounds. The great period of the classic Indian treaty, with savage protocol determining the manner and to some extent the substance of reports of treaty conferences, was over by 1784. The Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768 had been the climax. In the half century that preceded it, when the Six Nations occupied a strategic position between the English colonies and New France, Indian treaties assumed a form and texture different in many respects from what preceded or followed (Julian P. Boyd and Carl Van Doren,  <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Indian Treaties Printed by Benjamin Franklin</span>, <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0448">[448<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0448.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> Philadelphia, 1938). From the time of the Revolution on, reports or minutes of treaties came to read more and more like contracts and less and less like forest literature. Marbois, who seems to have been unimpressed by Indian eloquence, was nevertheless acting on a colonial precedent of long standing when he submitted to Vergennes a full transcript of all of the proceedings at the conference, including speeches filled with native imagery; the commissioners, in reporting to Congress, were acting in accord with the newer trend when they deliberately excluded the colorful and dramatic features of Indian treaties in favor of prosaic matters agreed upon. Though no text of any of the speeches appears to be preserved in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>, the copy sent by Marbois to Vergennes is in Arch. Aff. Etr., Paris, Corr. Pol., E-U, vol. <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xxviii</span>, 3226 (<abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ transcript ]">Tr</abbr> in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>). A translation of Lafayettes speech, signed by him and attested as a Free Translation, is printed in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography&lt;/i&gt;, 1877- ]">PMHB</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xiv</span> (1890), 31920, and also N. B. Craig, ed., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Olden Time</span>, &amp;c. (Pittsburgh, 184648), <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ii</span>, 4289; see also 51222. This version agrees in substance though not in phraseology with that published in <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penna. Jour</span>. and other newspapers, but in his letter to Congress Lafayette described the latter as inaccurate.</p>
<p>The newspaper publication of Lafayettes speech must be reinterpreted in the light of new matter presented in the text of the present letter as described in notes 25 below. Gottschalk, who employed the text that had been tampered with and revised by Madison some four decades after the letter was written, nevertheless clearly understood that everything Lafayette did seemed to turn into a golden opportunity, although sometimes only as a result of careful burnishing on his part (Gottschalk, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Lafayette</span>, 178389, p. 107). He also conjectured that Crvecur had obtained his copy of the speech perhaps from Marbois, conceivably from Lafayette himself and that Lafayettes embarrassment at the newspaper publication may have been pretended (same, p. 107, 1289). This conjecture is given additional plausibility by the observation made by Madison in 1784 and suppressed by him laterthat Lafayette would be impatient for the appearance of the speech in the gazettes of Europe without seeing any mode in which it can happen of course (see note 2). It is not unlikely nor uncharacteristic that Lafayette, in these circumstances, should have set in course through Crvecur the mode by which his performance at the treaty should become known to a wider public.</p>
<p>This becomes all the more credible when it is pointed out that newspapers had in fact already published the substance of the treaty itself before Lafayettes speech appeared in print. A New York paper of 16 Nov. 1784 informed its readers upon undoubted authorityperhaps that of the commissioners themselvesthat the Commissioners of the United States have concluded a treaty, at Fort Stanwix, with the six Indian nations, and have given peace to the Seneca, Mohawk, Onondaga, and Cayuga tribes, and received them into the protection of the United States, in consequence of their having delivered into the hands of the Commissioners six hostages (who are sachems and warriors) to remain in the power of the United States until the people, which have been captured by those late hostile tribes shall be delivered upWe are also to inform the public that, by an article of the treaty, a boundary line is established between the United States and the possessions of the six Indian nations, by which a very considerable territory is yielded up to the United States, to compensate them, in some measure, for the injuries which they have received from the said late hostile tribes, during the late war (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penna. Jour</span>., 20 Nov. 1784). The chief difference between this account and the commissioners report to Congress was that the former did not point out that the Indians had given up lands between Lake Erie and the Ohio in return for confirmation to them of their lands in New York; both were alike in omitting all speeches and formalities and in being confined to matters agreed upon by the two parties to the treaty. On the two succeeding issues of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penna. Jour</span>. following this quasi-official release of the results of the treaty, there appeared the more colorful Relation of what passed at the opening of the Treaty between the United States and the Indian Nations at Fort Schuyler, Oct. 3 (the caption given to Lafayettes speech and replies to it). Because of Lafayettes possible connection with the appearance of this Relation and because Crvecurs version of the proceedings appears not to have been published since 1784, the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penna. Jour</span>. account in its issues of 24 and 27 Nov. 1784 is here given in full:</p>

<p>WHILST I am thus drawing near unto my children, I thank the Great Manitow who has brought me to this spot of peace, where I find you all smoaking the calumet of friendship; if you remember the voice of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Kayewlaah</span>, remember also the belts and good counsels which he so often sent you. I am come to thank my faithful children, the chiefs of nations, the warriors, the bearers of my words; and if the memory of a good Parent was not more inclined to forget <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">evil</span> than <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">good</span>, I might now punish those who (whilst they were opening their ears, kept their hearts shut up) with a blind hand lifting up the hatchet very high struck their Father.</p>
<p>The cause of the Americans was a just one, did I then say to you, it is that of humanity, it is therefore peculiarly yours; remain neutral at least, and let the brave Americans take care of their independence and liberty: Your Father over the great lake will take them by the hand, the white birds will soon cover their shores, the great <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Onontbio</span> like the sun will clear away the clouds which hang over your heads, and the schemes of your enemies will vanish like smoke.</p>
<p>Listen not to <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Kayewlaah</span>, did other people tell you, listen not to what he says: An army from the North will enter triumphantly into Boston, another will seize on Virginia, and the great warrior <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Washington</span>, at the head of your fathers and brothers, be obliged to abandon their country. This, and a great deal more was said by people, who though they had their eyes opened, yet kept yours shut. Peace is made, you are acquainted with its conditions, and in pity to some of you I shall not repeat them.My predictions are accomplished; listen then to the fresh advices of your Father <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Kayewlaah</span>, and let my voice resound throughout the nation.</p>
<p>What have you ever gained, or rather what have you not lost by meddling with the quarrels of the whites?Be wiser than they, keep peace among yourselves, and make use of the favourable dispositions which the Council of the great Congress seem to manifest. The Americans are brothers to the French, your ancient fathers.This union will be as permanent as it is advantageous and useful;henceforth the great <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Onontbio</span> will always hold them by the hand, and they wish to with the Americans your brethren, and with such of your fathers as have crossed the great lake. In selling your lands take care you do not fool them away for brandy; dispose of them to the Council of the Congress for valuable considerations. If you have listened well to my words, I have said enoughrepeat them one to another. I shall hear from you from the other side of the great lake; and until I come again to smoke with you and lye on your matts, I wish you health, fortunate huntings, peace and plenty, and the fulfilling of such of your dreams as foretel good luck.</p>
<p><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">The Chief of the Mohawks rose, and holding up a Belt of Wampum, said,</span></p>
<p>LET the last of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Kayewlaah</span> (a great chief from <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Onontbio</span>) our father be obeyed; to receive my words father, we have heard thy voice; and we are glad thee hast revisited thy children, in order to give them good and wholesome advices. Thee hast said that we had listened to the wicked, and shut our ears against thy voice; that is true father; we the Mohawks have quitted the good path, we have been surrounded with a black cloud, but we are returned, and desire thee should find in us good and dutiful children.</p>
<p>Truely father it pleaseth us to hear thy manly voice amongst us, which without wounding us, does us a great deal of good: It seemeth as though <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Manitow</span> had led thee hither on purpose to smoke with thy newly found children.</p>
<p><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Kayewlaah</span> our father, as to our situation, thee hast said right, but we hope that the great <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Kitchy Manitow</span> will henceforth lead our feet in the good path, and that our past follies may be forgot, to the end we may enjoy peace and be unanimous in all our doings. Our father, we feel that all thy words are the words of truth, and experience hath shewed us that all thy <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">foretellings</span> are come to pass.

<p>Our Father, we remember thy words seven years ago, all, all are come to pass; yes, all thee has said is true, and that is the reason we are now come to smoke together the pipe of peace and friendship. Thee observeth that the <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0450">[450<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0450.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> alliance between the French and the Americans is an indissoluable chain; we believe it, our father.Thee hast advised us not to trifle our land away for strong drinks, we sadly want this salutary advice, for that is the source of all our follies and calamities, and we wish that in this Great Council nothing bad may ensue. Our Father, thy words of this day shall be heard among the Six Nations, and they will serve to strengthen and brighten the chain which is going to unite us together.Our Father, we shall say no more to day, because it is not fitting for us to multiply our words; we enjoy the present moment, and we will assist at the Great Council of the United states, and we felicitate the Members thereof on their safe arrival here.Thee hast said that thee departest tomorrow, may be, we shall add something more then.</p>
<p><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">On the next day there was another Meeting, when the Orators of the Friendly Nations thus addressed the Marquis:</span></p>
<p>Kayewlaah our Father.</p>
<p>LET all the Nations here present open their ears, as well as the great warriors of our father <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Onontbio</span>. Thy speech of yesterday, hold forth felicitations, reproofs, and counselswe receive them all in good part, because we well remember thy words seven years agothey preserved us in the right path.Behold this belt, received from our father Montcalm, some twenty years ago, by our fathershe told us we should always hold it fast. <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Keyewlaah</span> our father, all thy words are come to pass, therefore we receive with pleasure those of yesterday.</p>
<p>The Marquis delivering back the great belt, said, I am glad to see you have so faithfully preserved this ancient belt, and that it has had so good an effect on many nations which it has prevented from taking up the hatchet against the United States. France shall always hold one end of that belt, whilst the other end shall be held by the great Congress. I thank you for your fidelity in following my counsels, and shutting your ears against the enemies of this great Island.</p>
<p><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">A Huron Chief arose and said</span>,</p>
<p><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Kayewlaah our father</span>, open thy ears to the few words I am going to address thee before thy departure.The children of the North have long been those of the great <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Onontbio</span>,thy words have pleased us because they are true.First, thee beginneth with thanking the Great Manitow for bringing thee herewe thank him also for the same, and wish, that through his influence, thy counsels may become as so many blessings.

When we left the people of the North the Governor of Canada gave us exortations analogous to thy words. He advised us to behave decently, and to bring with us none but words of peace in the great council of the Thirteen United States,saying, that peace was made between the English and the Americans. Is not that like thy speech? He advised us likewise, to live in friendship with all the nations who may come to Niagara.</p>
<p><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Towanoganda, a Seneca Chief, arose and said</span>,</p>
<p><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Kayewlaah</span> our father, great warrior of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Onontbio</span>open thy ears to the few words I have to say. Thou acknowledge the superintending power of the Great Manitow which has brought thee to this place of peace and friendship. Then thee sayeth that as a good father thee loves to forget and to forgive. We well remember thy words seven years ago at Fort Johnson, which were, that thee knewest well the ground of the dispute between England and America, and that the cause of the latter was just, and that the great <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Onontbio</span> would establish a bright chain which would last for ever.Thee has called on our memory for the fulfilling of thy words. Thee has given us also good and important counsels for our conduct at this great Council. Our father, open thy ears once more.We had no time yesterday to deliberate on thy words.Every nation is liable to err, and we have committed a great many faults, at the instigation of Great Britain. We have been overcome, but it becomes all wise nations to forgive, and particularly the victorious <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">one</span>. Thee has heard our voice, all our thoughts are re-united round this great fire, kindled by the Congress, the representatives of which are here present. We hope, and our confidence is founded on this treaty. If the Americans address us with the words of peace, all will go well, and peace cover all the nations.Father, carry with thee this belt, and remember our words.</p>

<p>The Indian sachem who presented the belt of wampum that had been received from Montcalm was Great Grasshopper, an Oneida, who was still dressed in a Bavarian hunting costume that the French minister had presented to him in Philadelphia in 1781 (Gottschalk, same, p. 100, 104). Lafayette, Marbois, Madison, Caraman, and seven others left the conference on the same day and proceeded down the Mohawk; the commissioners then settled down to business and, contrary to general expectations and perhaps in consequence of Lafayettes influence, were able to conclude the negotiations as early as 22 Oct. <a id="TSJN-01-07-0365-kw-0004" class="keywordref" title="jump to Fort Schuyler in text" href="#TSJN-01-07-0365-ks-0001">Fort Schuyler</a>: After the Revolution Fort Stanwix was renamed Fort Schuyler, but newspapers, reports in Congress, and popular usage continued for a while to employ the older and more famous designation.</p></div>

But this was the revised reading made by Madison over four decades later, and the reading given above is what he wrote in 1784. The tampering in the present instance differed from that described in the preceding notes both in its substitution of another text for that deleted and in the manner in which Madison sought to cover up what he had done. In this instance he did not delete TJs interlinear decoding, but merely superimposed the words can be imagined on TJs words his vanity will (the code symbols for admit and TJs decoding of this word were merely deleted by Madison). In making this new interlinear decoding Madison obviously attempted to imitate TJs hand, for his m and n and other letters are more vertical and much more rounded than his own. This, however, still left the code symbols untouched, threatening exposure of the stratagem by which the aged statesman had sought to cover up his comment on Lafayettes vanity. To strike them out as had been done in the three preceding instances without striking out the corresponding decoding would have been merely to invite attention to the deceit. Faced with this dilemma, Madison decided to superimpose new code symbols on the old. This, of course, could not be done so easily with numbers as with words, but it appeared to be the only alternative. Madison, therefore, did the best he could. He carefully altered the initial symbol 706 to 786, and overwrote the next four symbols with less deceptive changes. At the end of the line he boldly inserted a fresh symbol d  359. This represented the final letter of his substitute phrase can be imagined, but neither the symbol nor its equiva]ent had been in the letter in 1784. No doubt he hoped that this would allay the suspicions of anyone who might have access both to the letter and to the code. The decoding for can be imagined should have read: 936. 219. 997. 576. 1053. 989 or, if Madison chose to leave out the e before d, the last symbol would be replaced by 359. But when he had finished his alteration of the original symbols, they read: 786. 640. 997. 476. 405. 359, which makes a nonsense reading as follows: ninethemimturntotald. What stood originally on the line, as can be deciphered by a correlation of remaining <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0452">[452<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0452.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> traces of the digits with minute unobscured portions of TJs decoding, was this: 706. 648. 734. 460. 429, which reads: his vanity will. Madison had evidently hoped that no one would suspect his carefully covered traces, and until now his hope has been justified.</p>
<p>In all of these tamperings with the text, Madison must have been prompted by a desire to avoid giving offense. His early characterization of Lafayette, as he must have known, was both perceptive and accurate, but even in 1784 the Lafayette legend was well on the road to being established. Lafayette himself had helped Brissot de Warville, Crvecur, Mazzei and perhaps some other writers of the day to give the correct impression of his share in Americas glory, thus managing to obtain a good press while preserving his reputation for modesty (Gottschalk, same, p. 437). After 1824, following his triumphal tour through the states, Lafayette was forever enshrined in the hearts of his adoptive countrymen, and Madison must have had no desire to detract from a figure so beloved, whom everyone knew, moreover, to be modest.</p></div>
