<p>Be it ordained, by the United states in Congress assembled, that the territory ceded by individual states to the United states, when the same shall have been purchased of the Indian inhabitants, and laid off into states, shall be disposed of in the following manner. It shall be divided into Hundreds of ten geographical miles square, each mile containing 6086 feet and four tenths of a foot, by lines to be run and marked due North and South, and others crossing these at right angles, the first of which lines, each way, shall be at <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0141">[141<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0141.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> ten miles distance from one of the corners of the state within which they shall be. But if the Indian purchase shall not have included any one of the corners of the state, the lines shall then be run at the termination of integral miles, as measured from some one of the corners, but shall be extended, by actual marks, only so far as the purchase extends. These Hundreds shall be subdivided into lots of one mile square each, or 850 acres and four tenths of an acre,<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0148-fn-0001" id="TSJN-01-07-0148-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> by marked lines running in like manner due North and South, and others crossing these at right angles.</p>
<p>For laying off the said territory, Surveyors shall be appointed by Congress, or the Committee of the states, who shall proceed forthwith, under the direction of the Register hereafter to be mentioned, to divide the same into hundreds, by lines in the directions, and at the intervals before mentioned, which lines shall be measured with a chain, shall be plainly marked by chaps or marks on the trees, and shall be exactly described on a plat, whereon shall be noted, at their proper distances, all watercourses, mountains, and other remarkeable and permanent things, over or near which such lines shall pass.</p>
<p>The Hundreds being laid off and marked, nine of them shall be assigned as a district to each surveyor, who shall then proceed to divide each Hundred of his district into lots as before directed, beginning with the Hundreds most in demand, and measuring, marking, and platting the said dividing lines thereof in the manner before directed for the Hundreds, save only that the lines of the lots shall be distinguished by a single mark<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0148-fn-0002" id="TSJN-01-07-0148-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> on each tree, and those of the hundreds by three marks. And that the said lots may be capable of more accurate description and distinction from each other, those in every Hundred shall be designated by the numbers in their order from 1. to 100. beginning at the Northwestern lot of the Hundred and applying the numbers from 1. to 10. to the lots of the first row from West to East successively, those from 11. to 20. to the lots of the second row from West to East and so on. The Surveyors shall pay due and constant attention to the variation of the magnetic meridian, and shall run and note all lines by the true meridian, certifying with every plat what was the variation at the time of running the lines thereon noted.</p>
<p>A Register shall be appointed by Congress, for each of the states within which the said territory shall lie, who shall keep his office within the said state, be resident at it himself, and provide a seal for authenticating its acts. To him returns shall me made, by the several surveyors, on the last days of March and August <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0142">[142<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0142.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> in every year, of the plats of all lines, measured and marked by them in the preceding half year, to be by him collated, and reduced into a general map of the whole state for which he acts. He shall annually, to wit, on the first Monday in November of every year, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Secretary of Congress, a copy of such portions of the said general map as shall have been formed, or further filled up, during the preceding year, retaining one in his own office for the use thereof. He shall have power to suspend any surveyor for negligence or malversation, making report thereof to Congress, or a Committee of the states, that they may direct a proper enquiry.</p>
<p>Each Register shall cause to be printed, under such devices, difficult of imitation, as he shall think best,<span class="space" title="space in original source" style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-right:1.5em;"></span>warrants, each of which shall give right to one lot of a mile square described as before directed: and<span class="space" title="space in original source" style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-right:1.5em;"></span>other warrants for each of the said states which shall give right, each of them, to one of the Hundreds of ten mile square as before described. These warrants shall have blanks for names and dates, shall be numbered and signed by the Register, sealed with the seal of his office, and shall be cut with indentures from a book, the margin of which shall be numbered in correspondence with the warrant cut therefrom, and shall be preserved in the office as a further check. The said warrants shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United states, and the Treasurer thereon debited with them. From thence they shall be sent in such numbers as the Register issuing them shall direct, to the Commissioner of the loan office for the United states in each of the states within the Union, the Treasurer countersigning them on parting therewith, and having a credit duly entered in his own account with the United states, and a debit against the loan officer, to whom they are sent.</p>
<p>Any person, chusing to become a purchaser of lands within the said territory, and paying to the Treasurer, or Loan officer, the sum of<span class="space" title="space in original source" style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-right:1.5em;"></span>dollars, shall receive in lieu thereof one of the said smaller warrants entitling him to a lot, or paying<span class="space" title="space in original source" style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-right:1.5em;"></span>dollars, shall receive in lieu thereof one of the said larger warrants entitling him to a whole Hundred within the state from which the warrant issued; the Treasurer or Loan officer inserting the name of the purchaser in the proper blank, filling up the date, and attesting the warrant by his own subscription. Loan office certificates, reduced to their specie value by the scale of depreciation, or certificates of liquidated debts of the United states, shall be receivable for the said warrants in lieu of money; and evidences of military <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0143">[143<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0143.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> rights to lands, herein after to be described, shall be receivable instead of the price itself of so much land. These warrants shall pass as lands, by descent or devise, but not by assignment nor by survivorship.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0148-fn-0003" id="TSJN-01-07-0148-fn-0003-ptr">3</a></p>
  <p>The owner of any warrant proceeding to locate the same, shall deliver it to the Surveyor of the district, wherein his location is to be, describing to him the particular lot on which he places it, or the Hundred, if it be a warrant for a hundred, by a designation of some point, either natural or artificial, within the said lot, or Hundred, so singular and certain as may be adapted to no other lot or Hundred; or by reference to the position of the Hundred, or number of the lot, which description the Surveyor shall immediately enter in a book well bound, with the date of the entry, describing the warrant located thereon by its number, date, signatures and name of the original owner, and leaving no blank space or leaf between that and the preceding entry, nor any margin by its side. If the location be made before the lot or hundred be yet laid off by lines actually run and marked, the Surveyor shall retain the warrant in his hands until the Hundred, if it be for a Hundred, or until all the Lots of the Hundred, if it be for a Lot, shall be actually laid off by marked lines: and then, or at the time of the entry, if the lines were marked before the entry was made, having satisfied himself by proper evidence, or by his own inspection and examination, on what particular lot, or on what Hundred, the location is, and that there has been no previous location on the same, he shall give to the party a certificate, describing the lot or Hundred so specially as that it may be known from all others, by particular marks or circumstances, natural or artificial, by stating the order or position of the Hundred relatively to the boundaries of the state, and specifying the lot by its number: with which certificate he shall return the warrant also to the party. These being delivered to the Register, and the warrant examined, and found genuine by him, he shall give a receipt for the same, and in due time proceed to execute a grant of the land in the following form.

Different lots, adjoining side by side within the same Hundred, may be included and passed by the same grant; but separate lots, and lots in different Hundreds, as also different Hundreds, shall be passed by different grants.

<p>On 2 Mch. 1784, the day following the acceptance by Congress of the Virginia Deed of Cession and the reading of the report of a plan for establishing temporary government in the Western Territory, Charles Thomson recorded that a committee as named above had been appointed To devise and report the most eligible means of disposing of such part of the Western lands as may be obtained of the Indians by the proposed treaty of peace and for opening a land officeand motion of Mr Montgomery (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ The National Archives ]">DNA</span>: <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>, No. 186). The Journal contains no mention of the appointment of such a committee or of Montgomerys motion on 2 Mch. (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.

By the middle of March it was reported that as soon as the Indian purchase had been completed a land office would be opened and that State in the Report calld Washington  disposed of (Samuel Dick to Thomas Sinnickson, 18 Mch. 1784, same, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">vii</span>, No. 544). On 20 Apr. there was offered in Congress a Motion of Mr Williamson for empowering Congress to establish rules and Laws of descent in Western Country during temporary government. The Journal contains no mention of this motion, but it was made during the debates in Congress on that part of the plan for the government of the Western Territory respecting hereditary titles and was referred to the committee previously appointed to draw up a plan for a land office (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ The National Archives ]">DNA</span>: <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>, No. 186). It may be, therefore, that the provision that lands should pass <a id="TSJN-01-07-0148-kw-0001" class="keywordref" title="jump to according to  Gavelkind in text" href="#TSJN-01-07-0148-ks-0001">according to  Gavelkind</a> was inserted in the report between 20 Apr. and 30 Apr. when the committee reported; it is not known whether Williamsons motion included a proviso in these terms, but it should be noted that TJs draft of a Constitution for Virginia in 1776 provided that Descents shall go according to the laws of Gavelkind, save only that females shall have equal rights with males (Vol. 1: 363). The report was finished by 25 Apr. but not reported until 30 Apr. (<a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-07-02-0129" class="document">TJ to Madison, 25 Apr. 1784</a>; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.

It was read the first time on 7 May when Monday next (10 May and the day before TJ left Annapolis) was assigned for a second reading. It was not brought up again, however, until 28 May and on the question as to whether it should be considered only Howell of Rhode Island, Mercer of Virginia, and Williamson and Spaight of North Carolina voted affirmatively (same, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xxvii</span>, 453). There the matter rested until 4 Mch. 1785. After being postponed various times, the ordinance was adopted finally on 20 May 1785. TJs geographical mile of 6086.4 feet, which he evidently hoped would be incorporated in a decimalized system of weights and measures (see his Notes on Coinage at end of Apr. 1784, Document <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">iii</span>), had been eliminated in favor of the statute mile; hundreds had become townships six miles square; a geographer had been added and the register eliminated; lots had been reduced to one square mile (640 acres); and most of TJs measures <a id="TSJN-01-07-0148-kw-0002" class="keywordref" title="jump to for preventing hasty and surreptitious titles in text" href="#TSJN-01-07-0148-ks-0002">for preventing hasty and surreptitious titles</a> had been thrown out (he had inserted them no doubt because of recent revelations of fraud in obtaining soldiers warrants; Harrison <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0148">[148<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0148.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> to Speaker of House of Delegates, 3 May 1784, Executive Letter Book, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Virginia, Richmond ]">Vi</span>); and the proviso concerning descent was eliminated. Some features not in TJs plan were added: lots 8, 11, 26, and 29 of the 36 lots in each township were reserved by Congress for future sale; lot 16 was set aside for public schools; and one-third of all gold, silver, lead, and copper mines was reserved for disposal by Congress (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.

But even as drafted in 1784 the report did not reflect TJs long-cherished hope of giving western lands away to actual settlersa hope not formulated as public-land policy until the middle of the 19th century and made unrealistic in 1784 in the face of an overriding financial need. The emphatic words in the stipulation that revenues from land sales should be applied to the <a id="TSJN-01-07-0148-kw-0003" class="keywordref" title="jump to National debt  and to no other purpose whatsoever in text" href="#TSJN-01-07-0148-ks-0003">National debt  and to no other purpose whatsoever</a> indicate TJs reluctance to accept this on any other ground than inescapable necessity. Thomas Hutchins, who was appointed geographer to the United States, immediately began surveys and by 1787 had completed four ranges of townships. But, as Jensen has pointed out, the land Ordinance of 1785 was soon forgotten. New speculative interests swept down upon Congress and grabbed for enormous chunks of the public domain. The drive was spearheaded by New Englanders and by others who had few if any ties with the pre-revolutionary land companies (Jensen, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">The New Nation</span>, p. 355). The Northwest Ordinance of 1787, a product of these and other economic and political forces, combined the dual purpose of establishing government and regulating land policy for the territories that had been embraced by TJs two separate reports of 1784 and with the differences noted above (see Vol. 6: 581ff.).</p></div>
