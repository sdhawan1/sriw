<p style="margin-top: 1em;">The Committee were apprized that the resolutions of Congress of Apr. the 18th. 1783. had recommended to the several states the raising an annual revenue by the establishment of certain imposts for the purpose of discharging the national debt, principal and interest. But it occurred to them that those recommendations were still before several of the legislatures;<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0007" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0007-ptr">7</a> that however desireable a<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0008" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0008-ptr">8</a> compliance therewith is, for the preservation of our faith, and establishment of a national Credit<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0009" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0009-ptr">9</a> yet as time has already elapsed, and more must elapse before their final confirmation can be hoped, as, after it shall be obtained time will also be requisite to advance the plan to the term of actual collection, good faith requires that in the mean while other measures should be resorted to for the purpose of discharging the growing interest.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0010" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0010-ptr">10</a></p>
<p>In the statement of the interest due at the close of the year 1782. the Committee have supposed its amount lessened by 1,200,000 dollars required and apportioned by the resolutions of Congress of Sep. the 4th. and 10th. 1782. and appropriated to the sole purpose of paying the interest of the public debt. This requisition gave license to the states to apply so much as should be necessary of their respective quotas of it, to the payment of interest due on certificates issued from the loan offices of their own states, and other <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0067">[67<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0067.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> liquidated debts of the United states contracted therein. Hence they suppose it has happened that the actual payment of these quotas have been uncommunicated to the Office of finance for the United states. The Committee are of opinion that the states should be desired to communicate to the Superintendant of finance the payments they have made under this requisition, and where they have been incomplete, to hasten their completion as the means still relied on by Congress for the discharge of that part of the interest of the public debt.And while on this subject they beg leave to add that from the representation to Congress by the Minister of France, referred to this committee, they learn that in some of the states a discrimination has taken place between the citizens of their own, and subjects or citizens of other countries, which was not authorized by the said resolution: they are of opinion that such states should be requested<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0011" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0011-ptr">11</a> to revise and reform their proceedings herein; and to extend the benefits<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0012" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0012-ptr">12</a> of this provision equally and impartially to all persons within its description.</p>
<p>Your Committee came then to consider in what way it would be best to call for the sums requisite for the services before stated, and they thought it their duty in the first place to enquire whether no surpluses might remain on former requisitions of Congress after the purposes were effected to which they were originally appropriated; under an assurance that it would be both the duty and sense of Congress to apply such surpluses, in every instance, towards lessening the next requisitions on the states. They found in fact that such a surplus would remain on the requisition of Oct. 30 1781. for eight millions of Dollars for the services of the ensuing year; and that this surplus would be great from the following circumstances. That requisition was estimated on supposition that the Continental army would be completed by the states to its full establishment, and that cloathing, subsistence and other necessaries for such an army must of course be provided. The states were far short of producing such an army. Hence the calls for money were proportionably abridged. It was estimated too on the further supposition that we might be disappointed in the endeavors we were then exerting to borrow money both at home and abroad, and of course that the whole must be supplied by taxes. Loans however were obtained and the surplus increased by this second cause. A third circumstance has further enlarged it. The payments on this requisition have been small and slow. Hence, instead of money, those who served and supplied the United states have received certificates only that money is due to them, and these debts <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0068">[68<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0068.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> have been transferred to the fund proposed to be raised by way of impost. So that tho the debts exist, they are removed from this to another fund. To know then the amount of this surplus, the Committee extended their enquiries to the sums actually received under this requisition, the purposes to which they have been applied, and the anticipations thereof still unsatisfied.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0013" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0013-ptr">13</a> They found that 1,486,511.71 only of the eight millions of Dollars had been received at the treasury at the close of the year 1783: that these had been applied to the services of the years 1782 and 1783: and that for other services of the same years debts were contracted to the amount of about one million of dollars more, which depend for their discharge on further receipts under this requisition.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0014" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0014-ptr">14</a> Your Committee then are of opinion that a surplus of 5,513,488.28 Dollars will remain of this requisition after answering all the demands which actually arose against it, which were not answered by other means, nor transferred to other funds and that this surplus ought to be applied so far as it will go, to the common purposes of the United states, so as to prevent new requisitions on them till the old shall have been exhausted, and to shew to those who may have paid their whole quota of any requisition that they will not be called on anew till all the other states shall in like manner have paid up their quotas.</p>
<p>Your Committee found also that there was a requisition of Congress of Oct. 16. 1782. for 2. millions of Dollars for the services of the year 1783, on which some small payments had been tendered, but that the Superintendant of finance had found it better to receive and credit them as part of the eight millions. They are accordingly comprehended in the sum before stated to have been paid in under that head.</p>
<p>Having thus stated the demands existing against the states, the Committee would have performed but half their duty had they passed over unnoticed their condition to pay them. Their abilities must be measured in weighing their burthens. Their creditors themselves will view them just relieved from the ravages of predatory armies, returning from an attendance on camps to the culture of their feilds, beginning to sow, but not yet having reaped, exhausted of necessaries and habitual comforts and therefore needing new supplies out of the first proceeds of their labour. Forbearance then, to a certain degree, will suggest itself to them. Those<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0015" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0015-ptr">15</a> entrusted with the dispensation of justice between them<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0016" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0016-ptr">16</a> will suppose both parties desirous that their mutual situations should be <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0069">[69<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0069.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> considered and accomodated. Your Committee are of opinion that if the whole balances of the two requisitions of eight and of two millions should be rigorously called into payment within the course of the present year, a compliance with such call would produce much distress; and that some term<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0017" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0017-ptr">17</a> short of this should be fixed on, within the reach of the least as well as of the most able states. They propose therefore that the states be required to furnish within the course of the present year such part of their deficiences under the requisition of 8. millions, as, with their payments to the close of the last year, will make up three fourths<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0018" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0018-ptr">18</a> of their original quota thereof: and that these payments be appropriated to the services of the present year 1784,<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0019" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0019-ptr">19</a> in conformity with the statement in the first part of this report,<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0020" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0020-ptr">20</a> giving generally, where accomodation cannot be effected among the several objects, a preference according to the order in which they are arranged in the said statement.</p>
<p>But while this proportion of former deficiencies is of necessity called for under the pressure of demands which will admit neither denial nor delay, the Committee must acknolege that even the punctual compliance expected from all the states will not effect completely<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0021" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0021-ptr">21</a> all the purposes of their preceding statement.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0022" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0022-ptr">22</a></p>
<p>To accomplish these perfectly; to enable the federal administration to fulfill the whole<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0023" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0023-ptr">23</a> of those just and desireable objects, they wish earnestly and warmly to encourage the abler states to go as far beyond this proportion as their happier situation will admit, under an assurance that their further contributions will be applied towards reducing the interest and principal of the public debt,<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0024" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0024-ptr">24</a> and will be placed to their credit in the next requisitions, with interest thereon from the time of payment.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0025" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0025-ptr">25</a></p>
<p>Individual states have at times thought it hard that while, in their own opinion, they were in advance for the United states on accounts existing and unsettled between them, they should yet be called on to furnish actual contributions of money. The Committee observe in answer to this, first, that almost every state thinks itself in advance: and secondly that it has been the constant wish of Congress that these accounts should be settled, and the contributions of each be known and credited. They have accordingly put it in the power of the states<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0026" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0026-ptr">26</a> to effect these settlements: and as a further encouragement to hasten this desireable work, the Committee are of opinion Congress should declare that so soon as these accounts shall be all settled, and it shall appear in favor of what states balances arise, such states shall have credit for the same in the requisitions next ensuing.</p>
<span class="pb center" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0070">[70<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0070.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>
<p>But it will be necessary also to remind the states that no materials have yet been furnished to enable Congress to adjust the ultimate ratio in which the expenditures of the late war shall be apportioned on the states. The Confederation directs that this shall be regulated by the value of the lands in the several states with the buildings and improvements thereon. Experiments made however since the date of that instrument for the purposes of ordinary taxation had induced doubts as to the practicability of this rule of apportionment.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0027" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0027-ptr">27</a> Yet Congress thought it their duty to give it fair trial, and recommended to the several states on the 17th. of Feb. 1783. to furnish an account of their lands buildings and number of inhabitants, whereon they might proceed to estimate their respective quotas. But apprehending that the incompetence of the rule would immediately shew itself, and desirous that no time should be unnecessarily lost, they followed it with another recommendation of the 18th. of Apr. 1783. to substitute in lieu of that article in the Confederation another which should make the number of inhabitants, under certain modifications the measure of contribution for each state. Both these propositions are still under reference to the several legislatures; the latter accompanied by the earnest wishes and preference of Congress, under full conviction that it will be found in event as equal, more satisfactory, and more easy<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0028" id="TSJN-01-07-0071-fn-0028-ptr">28</a> of execution: the former only pressed if the other should be rejected. The Committee is informed that the states of Connecticut, New Jersey, Pensylvania and S. Carolina have acceded to the alteration proposed; but have no evidence that the other states have as yet decided thereon. As it is necessary that the one or the other measure should be immediately resorted to, they are of opinion it should be recommended to the legislatures which have not yet decided between them, to come to decision at their next meeting.</p>

<p>It remained lastly to consider whether no facilities might be given to the paiment of these sums by the several states.

The first two of these broadsides were utilized by Thomson during the course of debates for the recording of amendments; both contain, either on their face or on accompanying slips, a full record of all amendments made to the report on arrearages of interest, and both were evidently employed throughout, copy (2) being used as early as 5 Apr. and as late as 27, 28, and 29 Apr. These broadsides, thus used by Thomson, are for the sake of clarity referred to in the notes below as CT 1 and CT 2 for the first and second respectively. The Monroe broadside was also evidently employed for a similar purpose during the course of debates.

This <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ draft ]">Dft</abbr> contains many deletions and interlineations, but most of these are variations in phraseology only and have not been indicated in the notes below; but see notes 20, 26, 27, 28.

Indian purchases of territory &amp; incidental expences  6. Contingencies  7. Deficiencies of the last appropriation  8. Debt. Of these, items 4 and 7 were struck out, items 2, 3, 5, and 6 contained the same totals as the report itself, and item 8, for which no total was given, was divided into Principal and Interest. Item 1, before TJ altered it, read as follows:</p>

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0;">It will be noted that, whereas Morris had recommended a civil list of $184,300, TJs committee on 5 Mch. submitted a view of the civil list as proposed to be reduced  but not made a part of the report, in which the total came to $68,525 (see under 5 Mch. 1784; Wharton, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Dipl. Corr. Amer. Rev</span>., <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Virginia, Richmond ]">Vi</span>, 780). The corresponding figure in the present document was first written 60,615  and then altered to 60,625 . This would indicate that this document was drawn up before 5 Mch. and that TJ later increased the sum to $68,625  as there given; however, after particularizing the three items of the civil establishment, TJ struck out the whole and wrote: Civil establishment 107,525 , which is the figure given in the present report on arrearages. From this it follows that TJ began his report soon after receiving the letters of Joseph Carleton of 1 Feb. 1784, stating the military requirements at $219,578, and of Robert Morris of 25 Feb. 1784 setting the civil list total at $184,300. This document is in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>: TJ Papers, 11: 1882. (2) A single leaf in TJs hand closely paralleling that printed in Vol. 6: 563 as a copy of an enclosure in <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-06-02-0413" class="document">Robert Morris letter to TJ of 25 Feb. 1784</a> and, like that, including observations by TJ. The five columns of figures there given are identical with those in this tabulation, which contains also two additional columns headed balance due to make of the 8.M and Apportionment of the 1,200,000. These two columns correspond exactly with the final and first columns, respectively, as given in the present report on arrearages. Beneath the tabulation are comments by TJ similar to those given with the corresponding tabulation printed in Vol. 2: 564, save that the supposed deficiency of collection was calculated at $838,887 35, making the total requisition $4,577,59115 instead of $4,513,48815. It is obvious that the tabulation given in Vol. 2: 564 preceded the present, for it gives current expences as $427,525, whereas the present includes the following: Services of the current year 1784. as agreed to by Committee  457,525. The present document also has, on its second page, a tabulation of interest on the national debt for the years 17821785 inclusive; this corresponds in arrangement (though not in figures) with the report on arrearages as originally drawn (see note 6). The total for interest on the domestic and foreign debt for 1784 was $1,923,877 as compared with $1,984,881 in the present report, the calculation for 1785 being also $1,923,877.

(3) Another single leaf in TJs hand corresponding closely to the tabulations of interest on the foregoing document No. 2, though its figures for interest on the loan office debt differ from those in the present report; it also projects interest costs through 1785.

The entry for the Dutch loan for 1783 was later struck out. TJ similarly marked the entry for 1784 concerning Public French loan of 24,000,000 livres and at foot of text wrote: by the Convention with France these paiments may be staved off till the first payment of capital becomes due if we chuse it.

When the Grand Committee reported on 22 Mch. 1784, TJ was its chairman and his name was at the head of the list; otherwise the names of the committee were the same and in the same order as on 23 Jan. (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/i&gt;, 17741789, ed. W. C.

Minister of france &amp; note relative to the payment of Int. to foreigners holders of loan office Certificates were also referred to the Grand Committee (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ The National Archives ]">DNA</span>: <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>, No. 186). TJ was at work on the report during February and March and, in addition to the economies in the civil list that he wished to effect as opposed to Morris views, the present report was regarded by TJs admirer, David Howell, as being a severe blow at the Superintendent of Finance in that part concerning facilities. For some time the loan officers had been issuing indents or certificates of interest due on loan office certificates and the states had begun to accept these indents in part payment of taxes, thus to an extent assuming a part of the federal debt. Morris strongly opposed this, but the present report recognized and legitimatized the practice by permitting each state to pay one-fourth of its requisition with such certificates (see Jensen, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">The New Nation</span>, p. 391). TJ and the Grand Committee had recommended that one-half of the sum could be so paid, but during the bitter debates in Congress this figure was reduced to one-fourth. On 17 Mch. Gerry moved to prohibit states from accepting securities issued by U.S. to public creditors and this motion was referred to a committee composed of Mr Jefferson Mr Williamson Mr Howell Mr Gerry and Mr Read apparently the matter was allowed to slumber in committee (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ The National Archives ]">DNA</span>: <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>, No. 186). But during the debates over the report on arrearages on 27 and 28 Apr. the issue must have been severely contested. When the struggle was over, David Howell reported that the facilities introduced in payment of part of the requisition for this year  was perseveringly opposed by the Superintendent of Finance, and finally acceded to by some only of his supporters, and that with great reluctance, and after a most warm and doubtful contest.

There were six or seven opponents of this feature of the report, but the hard core of intransigency was represented by Spaight, Read, and Beresford (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/i&gt;, 17741789, ed.

The fact that Luzerne wrote on 30 Jan. about discrimination against foreign holders of loan office certificates, that this letter was referred to the Grand Committee, that Marbois was very hostile to Robert Morris (he later wrote that Morris expected the French government to pay all the illegitimate profits that he had taken to himself, and of which he is unhappily in possession;Marbois to Rayneval, 24 Aug. 1784, Jensen, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">The New Nation</span>, p. 370) and that TJ was very friendly with both Marbois and Luzerne, suggests the possibility that when Marbois was in Annapolis early in 1784 TJ may have laid the train for Luzernes protest. This, of course, is conjecture, but circumstances and the report itself render it not implausible. When the report on arrearages finally came up for debate on 5 Apr., the Morris defenders moved to have it referred to the Superintendent of Finance for his opinion and report. This motion by Williamson, seconded by Read, was decisively defeated, seven states voting against it and two being divided. TJ did not vote, and only Mercer of the Virginia delegation voted for the motion (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/i&gt;, 17741789, ed.

On 5 Apr. McHenry, seconded by Spaight, moved that all of the first part of the report, from the word <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Resolved</span>, to the word and figures total, 5,480,203.33, [as given in the printed broadside] inclusive; together with the paragraphs beginning with the words In order to present to the eye, down to the words, and certified as in other cases, inclusive, be referred to the Superintendant of finance to report (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/i&gt;, 17741789, ed. W. C. Ford and others, Washington, 19041937 ]">JCC</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xxvi</span>, 1978), but this motion, too, was defeated decisively. On 28 Apr. Read, seconded by Stone, moved to refer to Morris the whole paragraph concerning facilities, but only Maryland and South Carolina voted in favor of the motion and it was defeated; the individual vote was 17 to 6 (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/i&gt;, 17741789, ed.

Mercer made an attempt on 27 Apr. to reduce the payment of interest on the domestic and foreign debt to one year on the supposition that a call for the whole arrearages of interest  woud only be attended with a failure of compliance on the part of the Statesa consequence that coud not but be destructive of Public Credit and that Congress should conform their requisitions to the abilities of their Constituents to pay (<abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ The National Archives ]">DNA</span>: <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>, No. 36, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">iv</span>, 4014; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/i&gt;, 17741789, ed. W. C. Ford and others, Washington, 19041937 ]">JCC</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xxvi</span>, 2979). This motion, seconded by Spaight, would have reduced the total requisition from $5,480,203.33 to $2,986,52.33. Mercers motion also included the following: in order to ascertain the precise sum due to the domestic creditors, the Superintendant of finance is hereby directed to cause all the loan-office certificates, and other public securities, to be revised and liquidated anew, and the interest thereon, to the last day of the year, 1783, to be added to the principal sums and securities issued agreeable thereto. This motion, however, was defeated by a vote of eight to one, with two states divided; of the 26 individual votes cast, only Montgomery, Hardy, Mercer, Williamson, Spaight, and Read supported the motion. As indicated in the documents described above, there must have been an effort to persuade the Grand Committee to call for a requisition that would have included interest charges down through the year 1785, but this was not agreed to and even the charges for interest on the national debt for 1784 were struck from the report during the course of debate. This was done on motion of Sherman, seconded by Wadsworth, during the debates of 22 Apr. TJ voted for deleting these items. On 22 Apr. he also seconded Hands motion to insert the following item at the end of the requisition: commutation to the army agreeable to the act of 22 March, 1783, 5,000,000, interest thereon, 300,000. This motion, however, was lost (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/i&gt;, 17741789, ed.

In the last source, the total of all items is given as $3,812,539.33, the total requisition as finally approved; the total in the printed broadside before deletion of the 1784 items is $5,480,203.33. As indicated above, there is a slip covering two-thirds of page 2 of the report and comprising all of the interest charges on the national debt. Both the page as originally written and the attached leaf contain the same items (with, of course, differing sub-totals), but they vary only in the fact that the latter divides all arrearages of interest into foreign and domestic categories arranged chronologically within each category, whereas theformer has these same items arranged chronologically under the years 1782, 1783, and 1784. This rearrangement and the wafered leaf must have been made in the last stages of the discussion in the Grand Committee and just before the report was submitted to Congress, for the report is a carefully prepared fair copy and the printed broadside follows the arrangement of the wafered leaf. The change was doubtless made because it had become apparent that some such compromise as that indicated above would have to be made whereby the requisition would be reduced by deleting the interest charges on the domestic debt for 1784.</p></div>

Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, New Jersey and Massachusetts supported the motion; New Hampshire, Connecticut, and New York were divided; and Pennsylvania and Rhode Island were against the amendment. The individual vote was 17 to 7 in favor of the motion, but the question was lost. Howell, seconded by Ellery, then moved to strike out three fourths and substitute three fifths. This, too, failed of adoption. Howell then moved to reconsider TJs motion; Foster, Howell, and Paine changed their votes, so that New Hampshire and New York switched from the negative to the affirmative side and Rhode Island became divided. Pennsylvania was thus the only state to vote against the motion, which was adopted (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress&lt;/i&gt;, 17741789, ed.

The fact that this appears as a deleted item in TJs rough draft would seem to indicate that he endeavored unsuccessfully to accomplish in the Grand Committee what was later done by amendment on the floor of Congress. It is not possible, of course, to determine whether this deletion in the rough draft was made by TJ on his own volition in the course of composing the report or whether it was made as a result of discussion in the Grand Committee, though the subsequent fate of the 1784 interest on the domestic debt would suggest the latter.</p></div>

Following this, in an unidentified hand, are the names of Mr Jefferson Mr Howel, indicating that TJ made the motion and Howell seconded it and possibly that the motion included the other amendments written on the verso of the slip (i.e., those indicated in notes 21 and 23). Another amendment at this point, possibly preceding TJs in time as it does in the final text, was offered by Stone and seconded by Gerry. On CT 1 opposite the words  from the time of payment Thomson placed a symbol keyed to a slip of paper (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>: No. 144, p. 95) headed to be inserted after the word Payment 21st Line 2d Page [i.e., column], and reading as follows: And also that before any further demand is made upon the States under the requisition for two million of dollars or the requisition for Eight million of Dollars Congress will revise the Quotas of the several States mentioned in the said requisitions respectively and will make them agreeable to justice upon the best information Congress may have when such Demand is made. The names Mr Stone Mr Gerry are endorsed on the face of this amendment.</p>
<p>After amendments indicated in notes 21, 22, 23, and 24 had been recorded in the manner described, it is evident that a single amendment was offered covering the passage embraced by all of these partial amendments, and Thomson, after deleting on CT 2 all of the passage reading the committee must acknowledge  with interest thereon from the time of payment, wrote in the margin see other side. On the verso of CT 2 appears the following comprehensive amendment for this much-disputed part of the report which represents the text as finally adopted: [But while this proportion of former deficiencies is of necessity called for under the pressure of demands which will admit neither denial nor delay] and the punctual compliance of every state is expected to enable the fderal Administration with certainty to satisfy these demands it is earnestly and warmly recommended to the abler states to go as far beyond this proportion in specie as their happier situation will admit under an assurance that such further contributions will be applied towards discharging the public debt agreeable to the preceding statement, and will be placed to their credit in the next requisitions, with interest thereon from the time of paymentand also that before any further demand is made upon the states under the requisition for two millions of dollars or the requisition for eight millions of dollars, Congress will revise the quotas of the several states mentioned in the said requisitions respectively and will make them agreeable to justice upon the best information Congress may have when such demand is made.
