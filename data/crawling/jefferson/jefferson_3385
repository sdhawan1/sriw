        <p>I am much disappointed in not receiving a letter from you by the last post, as we are all anxious to know where Congress means to fix its permanent residence, reports say it is to be in the woods near Princeton or on the delaware a little below Trenton. I think it impossible that either can be true. If I should be mistaken it will fix this state in an opinion that there is a decided majority against the southern states, and that they are not to expect that justice they are entitled to when the interest of the other states shall induce a deviation from it. Tho <a href="#TSJN-01-06-0276-kw-0001" title="[explained in note]" id="TSJN-01-06-0276-ks-0001" class="keyword">great offers were made Congress to remove to us</a> yet I never expected a compliance nor would I have voted for it if not Commanded so to do, as the common principles of honor would have forbidden it. Maryland is the central state and there it ought to have been fixed, no great matter in what part of it tho George town was certainly the most proper. A sufficient of members are not yet met to hold the assembly nor do I think we shall have one before the middle of next week.</p>

          <p>Harrisons disappointment in not receiving a letter  by the last post reflects a dissatisfaction that he occasionally voiced, especially with regard to John F. Mercers failures as a correspondent. On one occasion he chided Mercer bluntly and on another, when the proceedings in Congress on the Virginia cession of western territory were laid by him before the House of Delegates, he pointedly stated that the document this moment came to hand in a blank cover from Mr. Mercer (Harrison to Speaker of the House, 11 Dec. 1783, Executive Letter Book, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Virginia, Richmond ]">Vi</span>). There is no doubt but that Harrison placed much more value upon TJs communications from Congress and that he approved the plan of regular correspondence that TJ devised (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-06-02-0312" class="document">TJ to Harrison, 17 Dec. 1783</a>). <a id="TSJN-01-06-0276-kw-0001" class="keywordref" title="jump to great offers were made congress to remove to us in text" href="#TSJN-01-06-0276-ks-0001">great offers were made congress to remove to us</a>: On 28 June 1783, the last day of the session, the General Assembly unanimously adopted resolutions offering a fixed place of residence for Congress in the following terms: (1) that if Williamsburg should prove a fit Place, the General Assembly would present the Palace the Capitol and all the public buildings and three hundred acres of land adjoining the  city together with a Sum of money not exceeding one hundred thousand pounds this States Currency to be paid at five annual Installments and to be expended in erecting thirteen Hotels for the Use of the Delegates in Congress; (2) that the General Assembly would cede a district adjoining Williamsburg not over five miles square with such exempt Jurisdiction  as the inhabitants <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0346">[346<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-06/TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0346.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> residing therein shall consent to yield to Congress; (3) that if Congress preferred any place on the River Patowmack within this Commonwealth, the General Assembly would offer similar terms governing any place that should be selected, plus the additional purchase of 100 acres of land for erecting such public buildings as Congress might direct to be built; and (4) that if the legislature of Maryland should be willing to join in a cession of territory on the Patomac, the General Assembly would make a cession opposite to that ceded by Maryland, freely leaving it with Congress to fix their residence on either Side of the said River as they may see proper, but if Congress decided in this event to locate on the north side of the river, then Virginia would contribute forty thousand pounds for the aforesaid Purposes in full confidence that the State of Maryland will supply the Deficiency (attested copy of joint resolution in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>: <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span> No. 46, f. 55; endorsed in part by Thomson: Read July 16. 1783.

          <p>These resolutions also required that the Governor with Advice of Council  make application to the  Citizens [of the district five miles square adjoining Williamsburg] and report their assent to the Virginia delegates in Congress. This Harrison promptly did, apparently without consulting the Council (no reference to this matter appears in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> Va. Council Jour., <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Virginia, Richmond ]">Vi</span>), by writing to the mayor of Williamsburg to fall on some mode for obtaining the sentiments of the inhabitants on the matter of yielding jurisdiction. He added that the sooner it is done the better as I am convinced from a late Circumstance Congress will not remain long where they now are. The Advantages that will derive to the Inhabitants of the City are so great that I doubt not their giving as ample Jurisdiction as Congress could wish (Harrison to the mayor of Williamsburg, 4 July 1783, Executive Letter Book, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Virginia, Richmond ]">Vi</span>). On the same day Harrison sent the resolutions forward to the delegates in Congress, and exhibited evidence that the offer of Williamsburg was not expected to be accepted, but was apparently made to place Virginia and the Southern states in an advantageous bargaining position: he thought the legislatures offers are liberal, and I should think if considerd impartially the latter [i.e., the last] would be accepted, as it will certainly be more central on either side of the Patowmack than at any of the other places proposed (Harrison to Virginia delegates, 4 July 1783, same). But Harrisons confidence that the inhabitants of Williamsburg would grant ample Jurisdiction encountered a reluctance not without parallel in the twentieth century when the permanent site of the United Nations was being selected. At a meeting of the citizens of Williamsburg, together with those residing within five miles thereof, the resolutions of the General Assembly and Harrisons covering letter were discussed, with George Wythe presiding. The inhabitants stated that they were fully sensible of the great Advantages which will redound to the state in general, as well as to the said district in particular if Congress should decide to accept the offer and, if this should happen, they were fully determined to exert their best endeavours to make the place agreeable, by promoting harmony and good order, that the members of that august body may never have reason to resent their choice. But, they added, this meeting are not authentically advised, what extent of jurisdiction would be satisfactory to Congress, and they find themselves upon that account at a loss to define with precision the cession they might be willing to make in that respect and can only deal in generals, until they can have an opportunity of seeing the expectations of the honorable Congress drawn more to a point. In consequence, they concluded, this meeting are willing to submit to any such jurisdiction as may be compatible with their political welfare, and worthy of generous minds either to demand or yield (clerks copy of proceedings, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>: <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>, No. 46, f. 89, endorsed: Proceedings of the Inhabitants of Williamsburg  Read July 23. 1783.

          <p>I now fulfil my Promise [to forward the account of the Williamsburg proceedings], Gov. Harrison wryly informed the Virginia delegates,  tho you will collect nothing from it, but that they are still jealous of our Liberty and are unwilling to give up any part of it even to Congress. However when your desires on the subject are made known which I wish to be as speedily <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0347">[347<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-06/TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0347.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> as possible I doubt not but they will by their Moderation remove the apprehensions the Inhabitants of the District may be under of a loss of any part of their Liberty, and perhaps quiet some of the grave ones, on the score of the Luxury your Attendants will probably introduce (Harrison to Virginia delegates, 12 July 1783, Executive Letter Book, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Virginia, Richmond ]">Vi</span>). But in the bitter contests that were developing over the permanent location of Congress, such cautious dealing only  in generals was not calculated to have any weight in the decision; two days before the present letter was written Elias Boudinot expressed the fear that the late maneuvres relating to our erratic residence  [would lay] a solid Foundation for future divisions.
