<p>According to the desire of Congress expressed in their resolutions of the 17th Ult. I shall endeavor to inform them what has been done by this state in consequence of the <a href="#TSJN-01-03-0590-kw-0001" title="[explained in note]" id="TSJN-01-03-0590-ks-0901" class="keyword">several resolutions</a> there referred to.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">1779.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-03-0590-fn-0001" id="TSJN-01-03-0590-fn-0001-ptr">1</a></p>
<p>Mar. 9. Recommendation to the states to compleat their respective quotas of 80 battalions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">1780.</p>
<p>Feb. 9. United states to furnish their respective deficiencies of 35,211 men on or before the 1st. of Apr.</p>
<p>May 20. The United states to forward their quotas of troops to join the Continental army.</p></blockquote>
<p>The assembly at their session in May 1779. (being the first after the recommendation of Mar. 9.) desirous not only of furnishing their quota of troops then wanting, but to provide permanent means for keeping up the same by voluntary enlistments, passed an act for appointing a recruiting officer to be resident in every county, whose occupation it should be constantly to endeavor to enlist within his county souldiers to serve during the war. That the officer might be industrious he was allowed a premium of 150. paper dollars, then worth 12 hard dollars for every man he enlisted: that the people within the county might encourage the recruiting service, they were to have credit in any future draughts for all the men their recruiting officer should raise: and the souldier was to receive a bounty of 750. paper dollars, then equal to 62 hard dollars, the advantage of laying out his pay in the public store, at the hard money prices, and the other usual donations of clothes and lands. These encouragements however did not fully answer our expectations. The assembly therefore at their next session
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0509">[509<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-03/TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0509.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>
in Oct. 1779 took supplementary measures for raising their quota by endeavoring to re-enlist, for the war, their souldiers whose times of service would expire within the ensuing year. This essay also failed to produce their quota of men even as settled in the resolutions of Feb. 9. 1780. The Executive therefore immediately ordered nearly the whole of their troops which had been reserved for the particular defence of the state, to join the Continental army to the Southward. That some idea may be formed of the proportion of their quota which this addition effected, I beg leave to refer to <a href="#TSJN-01-03-0590-kw-0002" title="[explained in note]" id="TSJN-01-03-0590-ks-0001" class="keyword">the inclosed state No. 1.</a> made out from the returns therein referred to which have been made to me, their dates being from Oct. 13. 1779. to Mar. 5. 1780, except as to the state troops ordered into service as above, whose numbers are entered as they marched the 2d. of May following.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-03-0590-fn-0002" id="TSJN-01-03-0590-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> To these may be added something upwards of 300 new recruits then engaged for the war, of whom no return having been regularly made they are not entered.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-03-0590-fn-0003" id="TSJN-01-03-0590-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> The assembly which met in May of the present year passed one act for sending 2500 militia into the feild, which has been carried into execution: and another <a href="#TSJN-01-03-0590-kw-0003" title="[explained in note]" id="TSJN-01-03-0590-ks-0902" class="keyword">for raising by way of draught</a> one fifteenth of the whole number of our militia, which after all probable deductions they count upon as 3000. men.

<p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">1780.</p>
<p>Mar. 18. Sundry resolutions for calling in the bills in circulation and emitting new bills on certain funds.</p></blockquote>
  <p>The assembly which was sitting when the resolutions of Oct. 6. 7. came to hand, passed acts for increasing the public taxes and for borrowing money in order to enable them to comply with the requisition of Congress. The subsequent resolutions however of Mar. 18. 1780. as to the same money having rendered it necessary for the assembly to make a corresponding change in their measures, they passed at their late session <a href="#TSJN-01-03-0590-kw-0005" title="[explained in note]" id="TSJN-01-03-0590-ks-0003" class="keyword">the inclosed act No. 3.</a> to which I beg leave to refer Congress, and to assure them at the same time that the moment I can receive authentic advices that five other states shall have acceded to the resolutions of Mar. 18. this act shall be put into a course of execution.</p>

<p>This requisition could not be complied with in point of time for reasons explained in my letter to your Excellency of June 30. 1780. With that we sent on in money and bills 1,430,2398/9 Dollars. We are still to send on 522,9601/9 Dollars to make up our whole quota of 1,953,200 Doll. unless the resolution of June 17. was meant to appropriate this requisition to the supply of the military chest in the Southern department. There is no other balance due from this state whereon that resolution can operate, as will be perceived by my observations on the resolutions of May 21. On this head I pray instructions from Congress.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">1780.</p>
<p>Feb. 25. United states to furnish their respective quotas of specific supplies mentioned.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not in my power to state with accuracy what is done towards furnishing these supplies. Extensive orders have from time to time been given out, which have been carried, and still are carrying into execution; but no returns are made which enable me to say what is precisely done. On receipt of the resolution of Dec. 11. notice was given to the Continental Q. Master that we should be ready to give him orders for the grain which was then coming in under an act of assembly which had laid a specific tax in grain. What would be the amount of this, was not then known. We since find that what we allotted to Continental use amounted to about 80,000 bushels of short forage. Part of this has been received and the rest we are collecting for the Continental Quarter master and Commissary, to the posts recommended by Genl. Washington. This no doubt is counted in part of the subsequent requisitions of Feb. 25. Large orders are out for the purchase of beeves. Considerable quantities of specifics have been furnished to the troops marching to the Southward. Our endeavors indeed have been much disappointed by the insufficiency of our revenues to answer these, and the calls for money for other purposes. Our ultimate dependance for supplying deficiencies in the articles of meat, flour, salt, short forage, and rum, is on the <a href="#TSJN-01-03-0590-kw-0006" title="[explained in note]" id="TSJN-01-03-0590-ks-0004" class="keyword">act No. 4. herewith transmitted</a>.</p>
<p>A specific tax in tobacco is paiable on the 31st. day of December next. Of this about 3725 hogsheads were appropriated as a fund whereon to borrow money under the calls of Congress of Oct. 6. and 7. 1779. But another provision for this call being made by the act No. 3. these tobaccos remain unappropriated and of course free to be applied by the assembly according to the requisitions of Feb. 25. They will have brought in under the same specific tax as much as would make up the residue required. Whether they may think proper to change the appropriation of it for this purpose, or how otherwise they will furnish it, is for them to determine.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-03-0590-fn-0005" id="TSJN-01-03-0590-fn-0005-ptr">5</a></p>
<p>It would have given me great pleasure to have been able to shew Congress that their requisitions had all been complied with in this state accurately in time, quantity and every other circumstance. It will doubtless occur that some of these requisitions were difficult<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0512">[512<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-03/TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0512.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> in their nature, that others were new in experiment, and all of them on as large a scale as the people think themselves equal to. In states more compact, experiments, tho new, and difficult, are made with promptitude, their defects soon discovered and readily supplied. In those of greater extent they are carried into execution with less vigor and punctuality, and the time for complying with a requisition expires frequently before it is discovered that the means provided were defective. The time necessary for convening the legislature of such a state adds to the tardiness of the remedy, and the measure itself is so oppressive on the members as to discourage the attempting it, but on the last emergencies. These and other considerations will readily occur to Congress, and will refer to their true causes any inaccuracies which may have occurred in the execution of their desires.</p>
