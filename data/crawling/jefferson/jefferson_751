<p>Whereas in consequence of certain resolutions of General assembly the Governor with the advice of the council of state on behalf of this commonwealth hath entered into articles of agreement with Messrs. Peter Penet Windel and company of the kingdom of France, which articles are in these words following to wit. Articles of agreement entered into and concluded on the twenty second day of July in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy nine between the Governor of the commonwealth of Virginia with advice of the council of state on behalf of the said commonwealth on the one part, and Messrs. Peter Penet, Windel and company of the kingdom of France on the other part.</p>
<p>First. The said Peter Penet, Windel and company covenant and agree that they will establish at their own expence a Manufactory of arms, and Foundery of Cannon at such place on James river as they shall think suitable, that they will provide the same with able artists and workmen, that they will support and carry on the said Manufactory and Foundery for ever, and to such extent as that <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0132">[132<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-03/TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0132.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> they shall at all times and so often as they shall be called on after the first nine years hereafter more particularly mentioned be able from the manufactory particularly to furnish ten thousand stand of arms complete and well made within one year after the same shall have been called for by the Governor and council for the time being.</p>
<p>Second. The said Peter Penet, Windel and company will begin to erect the buildings and other works necessary for the said Manufactory and Foundery as soon as the place shall have been fixed on and procured for them.</p>
<p>Third. They covenant and agree to make at the said Manufactory and Foundery and deliver to the Governour or order six thousand complete stand of arms each stand to consist of a musket, bayonet and scabbard, two hundred and fifty carbines, two hundred and fifty pair of horsemens pistols, and two hundred and fifty swords within two years after the said place shall have been fixed on and procured for them, and the like number every year after for seven succeeding years, making in the whole forty eight thousand stand of arms two thousand carbines, two thousand pair of pistols, and two thousand swords reserving to themselves nevertheless a power of delivering the whole quantity before mentioned within such shorter time as they shall think proper. They will also make at the said Foundery such and so many Ordnance as shall hereafter be agreed on. The patterns for the muskets, bayonets and carbines shall be either the French model of one thousand seven hundred and sixty three or such as are now used in the British army at the election of the Governour and council to be declared at any time when such declaration shall be called for by the company such call not to be sooner than six months after the date of these presents the pattern of the pistols shall be the French model of one thousand seven hundred and seventy two or such as are now in use in the British cavalry at the like election of the Governour and council, to be declared as before provided in the case of the muskets. The swords shall be such as are used in the French cavalry, and shall be mounted with brass, there shall be duplicates of these patterns provided by the Governour and council, one of each to be deposited with the company, the other to be kept by themselves.</p>
<p>Fourth. The said Ordnance and fire arms shall be proved in presence of some person to be appointed by the Governour and council with a double charge of powder and ball three times repeated, the first proof to be at the expence of the company, the second and third proofs at the expence of the state. The Governor <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0133">[133<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-03/TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0133.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> shall not be obliged to take any arms which fail under either of these proofs. The person so to be appointed shall attend at the Manufactory and Foundery at stated times to see the arms proved, and give certificates to the company.</p>
<p>Fifth. The Governour shall receive the said arms at the Manufactory and Foundery.</p>
<p>Sixth. The Governour and council shall have right once in every two years to direct any alteration in the form or materials of the said arms which they shall think proper, they taking such arms as shall be on hand, finished, at the time of the alteration directed, and paying such additional price for those to be afterwards made as shall be agreed on if the alteration should enhance the cost of the workmanship or materials. Such agreement to be made amicably between the parties before the alteration takes place.</p>
<p>Seventh. The Governour and council covenant that they will use their best endeavors to procure for the said company such situation within the description of the first article as the said company shall fix on, together with a right to the water and other conveniencies necessary for the said Manufactory and Foundery; also three thousand acres of land in one or more parcels in the neighborhood of the said situation. If they cannot do it without committing violations on private property which the laws will not authorize, or without giving such exorbitant prices as the importance of this contract will not justify they will report the same to the General assembly at their next meeting; and if the assembly shall not devise means of having it done, the whole contract shall become void.</p>
<p>Eighth. The said Peter Penet, Windel and company covenant and agree that the articles so to be procured for them by the Governor and council as stated in the preceding covenant shall be estimated by honest and judicious persons, to be chosen by joint consent of both parties according to their real worth in gold and silver at the time they shall be purchased, but if the public shall have paid nothing for the water nothing shall be required to be paid them for it, and the said company will repay the sum at which the said articles shall be estimated either in arms to be made at the said Manufactory or Foundery at the prices herein after agreed on for other arms, or in arms or other merchandize to be specified by the Governour, and imported from France by the Governour and council or, if they chuse it, by the said company at the risque and expence of the commonwealth. The right of determining in which of the said ways paiment shall be made or how much in the one and how much in the other shall be in the Governour and council: and so much as <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0134">[134<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-03/TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0134.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> shall be called for by importation from France shall be ordered by the company so soon as the situation, land and other conveniencies before mentioned shall be procured for the company.</p>
<p>Ninth. The Governour and council agree that if the said Peter Penet, Windel and company shall fail in the execution of the preceding articles through too great difficulties or other unforeseen causes they shall not be liable to the commonwealth for damages for breach of contract. But in case of failure from any cause whatever the land water and other conveniencies procured for them with all improvements thereon shall become the absolute property of the commonwealth; the said commonwealth repaying to the said company the price which it shall have received under the eighth article for the said lands.</p>
<p>Tenth. The Governour and council will recommend to the General assembly the exempting for twenty one years the managers, artists and domestics imported by the company and employed in and about the Manufactory and Foundery from all public labors and from military service either in the militia or elsewhere. And in order to ascertain the persons entitled to this exemption, their several contracts with the company shall be exhibited to the clerk of the county in which the Manufactory shall be, to be by him copied and safely kept for the inspection of officers civil and military, courts of justice, and others concerned: if the assembly shall refuse such exemption the company shall be at liberty to declare the whole contract void.</p>
<p>Eleventh. The Governor and council will inhibit all officers from enlisting into military service before the determination of their engagements with the company, the artists and domestics which the company shall import and employ in and about the Manufactory and Foundery and which shall be ascertained as provided in the preceding article; and if enlisted, will have them discharged: and will recommend to the General assembly to make provision by law for preventing the citizens of this commonwealth from taking them into their service or seducing them away during the same term.</p>
<p>Twelfth. The Governour and council will recommend to the General assembly to make provision by law for enforcing the persons described and ascertained in the two preceding articles to a specific performance of their contracts for service, and to authorize the company to pass bylaws for the government of the said persons, inflicting penalties of fine and imprisonment where necessary: provided <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0135">[135<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-03/TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0135.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> that such bylaws shall not be in force until approved by the General assembly.</p>
<p>Thirteenth. The Governour will receive the arms contracted for in the third article in time and manner as there specified; and the commonwealth within six months after receiving them shall pay to the company for every musket, bayonet and scabbard thirty livres ten sous Tournois money of France, for every Carbine mounted with brass, thirty eight livres ten sous of like money, for every pair of pistols for cavalry, forty livres ten sous of like money for every horsemans sword mounted with brass with its scabbard twelve livres of like money.</p>
<p>Fourteenth. The Governour and council will undertake to purchase for the company one mine of iron, one of copper, and one of coal all of good quality if they can do it without committing violations on private property which the laws will not authorize, or if such mines can be found in unappropriated lands the company shall be entitled to a grant of one of each kind gratis: so as that they shall be entitled to but one of each kind by grant and purchase. They shall have liberty to search in any unappropriated lands for such mines, and the Governor and council will endeavor to get leave for them to search also in appropriated lands for the like mines. The Governour and council will undertake under the like reservation as to the rights of private property to purchase for, or grant to, the company five thousand acres of land adjacent to each of the said mines, and the streams of water necessary for working them. If any of the said mines shall become exhausted, the like shall be purchased or granted in the same manner and under the same reservation in lieu thereof. The said company covenants that the purchase money or cost of such mines, lands and streams of water shall be estimated by honest and judicious men to be chosen by joint consent of both parties according to its real worth in gold and silver at the time the paiment of such purchase money or price shall become due from the state, and that it shall be repaid by the company as is before covenanted by them in the eighth article as to paiment for the matters stated in the seventh article. The state shall at its own expence open a road from each mine to the river if that be practicable, or, if not, then to the nearest high road.</p>
<p>Fifteenth. The company shall have a right to conduct a canal from W[estham] to Richmond, and erect its banks on and through any lands whether [of public] or private property with a saving only as to the rights of John Ballendine so far as they shall be maintaineable in law and equity. But as to the rights of the said <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0136">[136<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-03/TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0136.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> Ballendine the Governour and council are of opinion that there being no reasonable prospect that he will ever complete the canal, his rights ought not to obstruct the completing it for the public convenience by other hands any more than the rights of others, and will therefore refer to the General assembly the subjecting his property in like manner with that of other individuals and also that the lands of individuals which shall be occupied by the canal and its banks, and damages sustained by them in consequence thereof shall be paid for by the commonwealth, and such paiment not redemanded from the company. The breadth of the said canal and horseway on each side, and the depth of water for navigation, as also the toll to be allowed to the company and mode of levying it shall be as the General assembly shall prescribe. The company shall declare before the first day of January one thousand seven hundred and eighty one or so soon after as the General assembly shall have prescribed the circumstances just before mentioned whether they will undertake the canal or not, and at the same time shall declare within what term they will complete it. If that term shall exceed ten years the General assembly shall be at liberty to declare the several articles of this contract relative to the said canal, to be void. If they undertake and fail to complete it within the term agreed; their rights under the same articles shall vest in the commonwealth. It shall be lawful for the General assembly at any time after the year one thousand eight hundred and forty to take into the hands of the commonwealth the property of the canal, its water locks, banks and other appendages, and the necessary privileges in the adjacent ground for repairing them, leaving to the undertakers the use of such portions of the water and in such places for working of their machines as they shall have applied to that use during the first twenty five years after their undertaking it, and paying to them the double of what the opening the said canal, building the locks, banks, and other the said appendages thereof shall have cost them; the amount of which cost shall be kept by the company separate and apart from that of their other works and shall annually with their vouchers be laid before persons jointly to be chosen by the Governour and council and the company, to be by them examined and certified so far as they find them just, and a copy of such certificate to be given each party and to be binding between them. Where such cost shall have been defrayed in paper money or commodities the true worth thereof in gold and silver at the time of the expenditure and at the place where expended shall be estimated by the same persons, and the repaiment thereof, as also of all expenditures <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0137">[137<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-03/TSJN-01-03-02-pb-0137.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> of gold and silver shall be made in double the quantity of gold and silver as before agreed. In consideration of this right of resumption reserved to the commonwealth, the Governour and council will recommend to the General assembly to take the same into their consideration when they shall proceed to establish the toll and to allow such toll as will with tolerable certainty reimburse the company within the term of fifty years, and also to give a right of passage toll free to all the productions of the Manufactory and Foundery and the necessaries for them till the year one thousand eight hundred and ninety.</p>
<p>Sixteenth. In case of the impracticability or too great difficulty of opening the canal aforesaid the state will at its own expence prepare a firm and commodious road from the Manufactory and Foundery into the main road leading to Richmond, for transporting the Cannon and other productions of the Manufactory and foundery.</p>
<p>Seventeenth. The Governour and council will extend to the company all protection assistance and privileges which to them shall appear reasonable, and shall be within their power, and will recommend the same to be done by the General assembly.</p>
<p>Eighteenth. The Governour and council covenant and agree that the preceding articles shall be binding on them and their successors on behalf of the commonwealth, and the said Peter Penet, Windel and company covenant and agree that the said preceding articles shall be binding on them jointly and severally, their joint and several heirs, executors and administrators.</p>
<p>In witness whereof Thomas Jefferson esq. Governour of the commonwealth of Virginia, on the part of the commonwealth and with advice of the council of state and Peter Penet on the part of the said Peter Penet, Windel and company have hereto interchangeably set their hands and seals on the day and year first above written.</p>
