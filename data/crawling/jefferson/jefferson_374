Docketed by Edmund Randolph: May 28. 1778. read the first time. May 29. 1778. read 2d. time &amp; to be engd. Examined. The Act as adopted has the same title and precisely the same wording as the Bill except for the words supplied in the blank spaces left by TJ (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W.

The deleted parts, indicated in notes below, tend to prove that this draft of the Bill is TJs original composition, not a fair copy such as he usually employed in reporting a bill.</p>


   <p style="margin-top: 1em;">The background of this extraordinary case is to be found in the following: Henry, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Henry</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span>, 61113; <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Elliots Debates</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">iii</span>, 66, 140, 193, 223, 236, 274, 298, 450; W. P. Trent, The Case of Josiah Philips, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Amer. Hist. Rev</span>., <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span> (18951896), p. 44454. Ford (<span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ii</span>, 149) states that this Bill was a violation of article 8 of the Virginia Declaration of Rights and was afterwards cited by Edmund Randolph  as such, in the following words: There is one example of this violation in Virginia, of a most striking and shocking nature,an example so horrid that, if I conceived my country would passively permit a repetition of it, dear as it is to me, I would seek means of expatriating myself from it. A man who was then a citizen, was deprived of his life thus: from a mere reliance on general reports, a gentleman in the House of Delegates informed the house that a certain man (Josiah Philips) had committed several crimes, and was running at large perpetrating other crimes. He therefore moved leave to attaint him; he obtained that leave instantly; no sooner did he obtain it, than he drew from his pocket a bill ready written for that effect; it was read three times in one day and carried to the Senate. I will not say that it passed the same day through the Senate; but he was attainted very speedily and precipitately, without any proof better than these vague reports. Without being confronted with his accusers and witnesses, without the privilege of calling evidence on his behalf, he was sentenced to death, and was afterwards actually executed. Also, St. George Tucker asserted that the judges of the General Court refused to apply the Act of attainder and that Philips was put upon his trial, according to the ordinary course of law (Tucker, ed., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Blackstone</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span> [1803], Appendix, p. 293). TJ was in France when Randolph produced his amalgam of errors, and may not have seen the speech until 1815. On 27 July 1814 William Wirt wrote TJ asking what he knew about the case and merely referring to the fact that Mr. Henry was much censured by Mr. Ed. Randolph, in the convention of 1788; TJ replied that the censure of Henry was without foundation; that he remembered the case; and that Philips was a mere robber, who availing himself of the troubles of the times, collected a banditti, retired to the Dismal swamp, and from thence sallied forth, plundering and maltreating the neighboring inhabitants, and covering himself, without authority, under the name of a British subject. Mr. Henry, then Governor, communicated the case to me. We both thought the best proceeding would be by bill of attainder, unless he delivered himself up for trial within a given time. Philips was afterwards taken; and Mr. Randolph being attorney General and apprehending he would plead that he was a British subject, taken in arms, in support of his lawful sovereign, and as a prisoner of war entitled to the protection of the law of nations, he thought the safest proceeding would be to indict him at Common law as a felon and robber. Against this I believe Philips urged the same plea; but was overruled and found guilty (TJ to Wirt, 14 Aug. 1814).</p>


   <p>The next year, however, TJ answered Randolphs charges much more fully, though he attributed his errors to the zeal of an orator who in the ardor of conflict, [loses sight] of the rigorous accuracies of fact (TJ to Girardin, 12 Mch. 1815). In this same letter TJ said that Randolphs decision to try Philips at common law was a course which every one approved, because the first object of the act of attainder was to bring him to fair trial. TJ rewrote that part of Girardins history so as to coincide with his memory of the proceedings on this Bill, and Girardin published TJs revision (Burk-Girardin, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Hist. of Va.</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">iv</span>, 3056). TJ did not, however, recall the ironic fact that Randolph himself, as <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0192">[192<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0192.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> clerk of the House, had docketed the Bill, though he repeated the account he had given Wirt of Randolphs decision not to make use of the Act.</p>


   <p>While there is no clause in the Virginia Declaration of Rights or the Constitution of 1776 specifically prohibiting the legislature from passing bills of attainder, as, for example, there is in the Federal Constitution (Art. <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span>, sect. 9), Coke and others had condemned such bills long before the American Revolution (C. H. McIlwain, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">The High Court of Parliament</span>, 1910, p. 225). Yet to find such a bill proposed and drafted by TJ and enacted into law under his leadership is, to say the least, surprising. It is far more so to find him, so late as 1815, speaking of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">proper</span> office of a bill of attainder. Yet, so far as such a Bill could be justified in terms of the principles of a republic, his distinction between proper and improper use accords with the nature of the Act of Attainder of 1778: When a person, charged with a crime, withdraws from justice, or resists it by force, either in his own or a foreign country, no other means of bringing him to trial or punishment being practicable, a special act is passed by the legislature, adapted to the particular case. This prescribes to him a sufficient term to appear and submit to a trial by his peers; declares that his refusal to appear shall be taken as a confession of guilt, as in the ordinary case of an offender at the bar refusing to plead, and pronounces the sentence which would have been rendered on his confession or conviction in a court of law. No doubt that these acts of attainder have been abused in England as instruments of vengeance by a successful over a defeated party. But what institution is insusceptible of abuse in wicked hands? (TJ to Girardin, 12 Mch. 1815). The Bill that TJ drew, though it was indeed an attainder limited by the condition that Philips surrender himself before a certain date to be tried according to regular judicial procedure, nevertheless was an assumption by the legislature that (1) Philips was a common criminal and was not acting under a British commission, and (2) that the legislature could of right make such a distinction affecting the life and liberty of an individual. Since this was assuming to the legislature a power over the rights of an individual usually regarded as belonging within the province of the judiciary and under protection of established legal procedures, the least that can be said about the Bill of Attainder of 1778 is that it was an extreme violation of TJs belief in the principle of the separation of powers of government.</p>


   <p>There is no doubt that Josiah Philips had been duly charged with crime, had withdrawn from justice, had resisted it by force, and had continued from 1775 to 1778 in his course of pillage and terrorism. On 20 June 1777 the council authorized the governor to issue a proclamation offering a reward for the capture of Philips and two other leaders of a group of evil disposed persons, to the number of ten, or twelve, [who] have conspired together, to foment a Dangerous Insurrection; Patrick Henry issued the proclamation the same day. On 3 Jan. 1778 the council authorized the governor to issue a warrant for 55 for the purpose of rewarding sundry persons for apprehending Josiah Philips who was outlawed by the Governor the 20th June last as a Traitor to the State. Apparently Philips, after being captured, must have effected his escape, for on 1 May 1778 the council received word from Col. Muter that the noted Traitor has again made an Insurrection in Princess Anne County at the head of fifty Men. The council authorized the governor to call out 100 of the militia from Nansemond, to offer a reward of $500 for apprehending Philips dead or alive, and to divide any booty among the captors of the traitor. By 27 May, however, Governor Henry laid before the council a letter he had received from Col. John Wilson saying that the militia was ineffective and recommending the Removal of such Families as are in League with the Insurgents as a Step  absolutely necessary; the council advised Henry to send this letter to the Assembly and to order out a company of regular troops (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Council of the State of Virginia&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

According to TJs letter to Wirt of 14 Aug. 1814, Henry consulted TJ before laying Wilsons letter before the council and both agreed upon a bill of attainder; Trent (p. 446) asserts that TJ had probably instigated the letter which Henry transmitted to the House. The last may be so, but TJ was probably mistaken in recalling that he and Henry had agreed upon a bill of attainder. For what Henry asked the legislature to consider was Wilsons proposal about the removal of some families: thinking that the Executive power is not competent to such a purpose, I must beg leave to submit the whole matter <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0193">[193<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0193.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> to the general Assembly, who are the only Judges how far the methods of proceeding directed by Law, are to be dispended with on this occasion (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Official Letters of the Governors of the State of Virginia&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

(During the preceding year, on a threatened invasion, the governor and council had authorized the militia to remove and restrain, during the imminence of the danger  certain persons whose affections to the American cause were suspected, and the legislature had subsequently passed an Act of Indemnification for this use of executive power, indicating that Henry must have felt that on such a matter he did lack power; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W.

Henrys letter of 27 May was laid before the House on the same day, together with Wilsons letter; the House immediately resolved itself into the committee of the whole and debated the matter. On 28 May the committee of the whole again discussed the problem of the insurgents and agreed upon the following resolution: Information being received that a certain<span class="space" title="space in original source" style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-right:1.5em;"></span>Philips, with divers others, his associates and confederates, have levied war against this Commonwealth within the counties of Norfolk and Princess Anne, committing murders, burning houses, wasting farms, and doing other acts of enormity, in defiance of the officers of justice, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Resolved, that it is the opinion of this committee</span>, that if the said<span class="space" title="space in original source" style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-right:1.5em;"></span>Philips, his associates and confederates, do not render themselves to some officer, civil or military, within this Commonwealth, on or before the<span class="space" title="space in original source" style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-right:1.5em;"></span>day of June in this present year, such of them as fail so to do ought to be attainted of high treason; and that in the meantime, and before such render, it shall be lawful for any person, with or without orders, to pursue and slay, or otherwise to take and deliver to justice the said<span class="space" title="space in original source" style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-right:1.5em;"></span>Philips, his associates and confederates.

TJ was appointed chairman of a committee of three to draft the Bill; he reported it the same day, when it was read the first time. On 29 May it was read the second time; on 30 May it passed the third reading; TJ carried it to the Senate and the Senate approved it the same day (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, May 1778, 1827 edn., p. 20, 22, 23, 24, 28, 33).</p>


   <p>Philips and some of his confederates were apprehended before the time limit set by the Act of Attainder had expired. Last Tuesday the noted Josiah Philips, and James Hodges, were safely lodged in the publick jail by the sheriff of Princess Anne.
