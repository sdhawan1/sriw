Docketed in hand of Edmund Randolph: Octr. 27. 1778. read first time.

This text is referred to below as <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (2). The Act as adopted, which agrees precisely with the text of <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (1) except as indicated below, is in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W.

   <p>Although <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (2) was the Bill that was introduced and <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (1) represents the amendment offered to it, the latter was in effect an entire new Bill and was adopted. The initial stages of the legislative history of <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (2) are indicated in the docketing quoted above; between 5 Nov. and 13 Dec. consideration of the Bill as introduced by Terry was postponed no less than ten times. This may possibly have been due to the fact that TJ was absent from the House until 30 Nov.: his colleagues, knowing the leading part he had taken in drafting the judiciary bills, may have deferred action on this amending Act until his arrival. This supposition is given weight by the fact that <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (1), which bears alterations in his hand, was, on 18 Dec., offered as an amendment in substitution for the Terry Bill and was adopted by the House on 19 Dec.: the Senate agreed to this amendment or substitute Bill the same day (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1778, 1827 edn., p. 29, 32, 46, 51, 56, 67, 76, 81, 90, 94, 100, 108, 110, 112, 1245, 126). It is probable that TJ was not the author of the Bill as introduced by Terry or of the substitute embraced in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (1), though, as indicated in note 2, below, he certainly was instrumental in keeping the latter from interfering with an Act passed at the previous session.</p>

   <p><abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (1) contained no enacting clause, having been offered as an amendment to <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (2) as introduced by Terry.

<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-02-0094-fn-0002-ptr" id="TSJN-01-02-0094-fn-0002">2</a>

   <p><abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (2) does not contain a paragraph corresponding to the foregoing. As originally drafted in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (1), this paragraph provided that at the March and October terms the first four days should be set aside for the trial of criminal causes and at the June and December terms the first three days should be devoted to the same purpose. This would have had the effect of amending an Act passed at the May 1778 session, the object of which was to create two additional terms, to be held in June and December, for the purpose of trying criminal causes only (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-02-02-0063" class="document">Bill to Enable Judges of the General Court to Hold Two Additional Sessions, under date of 27 May 1778</a>; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W. Hening, &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; ]">Hening,</span> <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ix</span>, 4601); this Act of May 1778 provided, however, that treasons, felonies, misdemeanors, and other commonwealth pleas should continue to be cognizable at the March and October terms as theretofore. <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (1) as originally drawn, therefore, would have had the effect of making other than criminal causes cognizable at the June and December terms; this apparently was unacceptable to TJ and he therefore struck out the proviso relating to these two terms, interlined the necessary changes, and caused the paragraph to read as above and as in the Act as adopted. By this alteration he left the June and December terms to serve their oyer and terminer functions as contemplated by the Act of May 1778. In view of this, it is likely that TJ was not the author of <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (1); conversely, the change that he made in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (1) to safeguard the object of the Act of May 1778 is further evidence that he was probably the author of that Act.</p>

   <p>And be it further enacted that instead of the 6th. day, all criminal process in the General court shall be returnable to the first Monday in each of the March and October sessions; and the court shall proceed on the said first monday to the trial of criminals.</p>
