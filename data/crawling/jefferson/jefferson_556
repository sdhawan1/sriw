Nov: 29. Read the first Time. Read the second Time &amp; commd. to a Com: of the whole on Monday next. To be engrossed.

One was copied, with some amendments proposed by T. J. from the act in October session 1777. The other is more approved by G. W. because it is shorter and, as he thinks, contains all that is good in the other (see Document <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">iv</span>, 2, below). Diagonal line is drawn through text, indicating that it is the one Wythe did not prefer. (3) <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ draft ]">Dft</abbr> (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>), referred to in the endorsement just quoted, is also in the hand of Wythe and was presumably drawn about the time of the foregoing which he rejected; neither was followed by the Committee of Revisors, since the text here given is closer to the Bill introduced 29 Nov. 1777 than to these two. The text which Wythe rejected partly because of its length consists of one page of 26 lines; the text which he approved consists of 25 lines.

   <p>The purpose of this Bill is obvious but was not stated probably because An act for enabling the publick contractors to procure stores of provisions, which was drawn by a committee consisting of TJ and George Mason and was being considered in the House from Nov. 1777 to Jan. 1778 concurrently with the Bill to prevent forestalling, set forth the same purpose explicitly. The preamble to that Act, whose original Bill, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Virginia, Richmond ]">Vi</span>), is in the hand of Mason, stated that divers persons devoting themselves to Avarice and Extortion, and intending to amass Riches out of the Ruins of their Country, or treacherously to betray it into the Hands of its Enemies, by forestalling and ingrossing the Provisions necessary for the Sustenance of its Armies in the ensuing Campaign, have industriously bought up, and already got into their Possession, so great a proportion of the Provisions usually brought to Market at this Season, that there is little Hope of our being able to lay up such Stores thereof as will be requisite for the Purposes of the succeeding Year, and some of them refuse to sell the same to the public Agents Contractors and Commissaries or demand such prices as amount to a Refusal, because they woud endanger a public Bankruptcy; and others under Pretence of exporting the same for Sale, mean to supply our Enemies therewith (much of this preamble was struck out by the legislature; see the Act as adopted in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W.

On 20 Nov. 1777 TJ was appointed member of a committee to bring in a Bill to prevent forestalling; he presented draft of Bill on 29 Nov. It was later considered by the House and amended; Senate also amended Bill, and House agreed to all save one of Senate amendments; from this one the Senate receded on 8 Jan. 1778 (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1777, 1827 edn., p. 35, 49, 93, 94, 101, 103, 107). The exceptions in this Act led to abuses and an amending Act was passed at the Oct. 1778 session (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W. Hening, &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; ]">Hening,</span> <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ix</span>, 5801); Text (2) and Text (3) were simplified versions of the Bill as first enacted, but the text given here incorporates some of the provisions of the amending Act and was therefore probably selected for inclusion by the Committee of Revisors after Texts (2) and (3) were drawn. Those texts differ greatly in phraseology from all others, but are in substance much the same as the original Act; the chief difference apparently is that Text (3) includes bartering as well as buying and selling in the definitions of forestaller and engrosser. The more important of the variations in the texts considered by the Committee of Revisors are indicated in the textual notes. At the Oct. 1779 session the amending Act of 1778 was revived and continued for another year. At the same time a duty of 2% was laid upon all goods imported from other states or foreign countries which were intended for sale at vendue within nine months of the date of importation; a prohibition was also laid on owners of such goods and vendue <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0565">[565<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0565.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>  masters to prevent their bidding at sales in order to advance prices, unless bids by vendue masters were bona fide purchases of goods for personal or family use (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W.

At the session of May 1781 the Act to prevent forestalling was revived and continued for another year; it was not revived again after its expiration (same, p. 425). Bill No. 89 was presented by Madison on 31 Oct. 1785, postponed 14 Dec. to next session, and brought up again on 1 Nov. 1786; apparently no further action was taken on it (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1785, 1828 edn., p. 1215, 92; Oct. 1786, p. 1617).</p>

   <p>Text (1) and Text (5) read: four miles; Text (2) originally agreed with these and was altered to two miles.</p>

   <p>Text (1) and Text (5) read United States. Text (2) originally read United States and was altered to agree with the text here given. This interesting change was probably made by Wythe, since Text (2) is the text which TJ had approved and since the alteration was probably made as Wythe transcribed it. In all other instances where the text as given here employs the phrase confederating states or its equivalent, Text (1) and Text (5) read United States.</p>
</div>

   <p>Text (1) reads: or shall buy within any of the United States to sell again in this Commonwealth, but this was deleted by a House amendment.</p>

   <p>The clause or shall buy to sell again, any victual raised within this Commonwealth is not in Text (1) or Text (5). The exception allowed in the foregoing, in respect to victuals, led to abuses which were the subject of the amending Act passed in the session of Oct. 1778; under cover of this exception, the Act stated, a practice hath prevailed of buying up great quantities of victual from those who make and raise the same, and withholding it from the poor and from the publick, until they have agreed to give a very advanced price for the same, which practice is found to be mischievous and oppressive. Accordingly, in respect to victuals, an engrosser was by this Act defined to be merely one who bought within Virginia to sell again in that or in another state any victual raised in the Commonwealth (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W. Hening, &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; ]">Hening,</span> <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ix</span>, 5813). Hence the clause or shall buy to sell again, any victual raised within this Commonwealth was inserted in Bill No. 89 of the <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Report of the Committee of Revisors Appointed by the General Assembly of Virginia in MDCCLXXVI&lt;/i&gt;, Richmond, 1784 ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Report</span></span> in order to make it conform to this amending Act; both Text (2) and Text (3), though differing in phraseology, embrace the same proviso respecting victuals raised in Virginia. This would seem to indicate that these texts were drawn up after the passage of the amending Act of 1778 and rejected in favor of the present text sometime before 18 June 1779.</p>

The Senate offered an amendment at this point to insert, after the word water, the following: nor to any person, commissioned by another, to purchase salt for one years consumption of his family, such purchase not exceeding one peck for each person therein. But the House on 6 Jan. 1778 declined to agree to this amendment, and, two days later, the Senate receded from it (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1777, 1827 edn., p. 103, 107).</p>
