<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0;">Whereas<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0001" id="TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> it is represented by many of the Inhabitants of this Country who dissent from the Church of England as by Law established that they consider the Assessments and Contributions which they have been hitherto obliged to make towards the support and Maintenance of the said Church and its Ministry as grievous and oppressive, and an Infringement of their religious Freedom. For Remedy whereof<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0002" id="TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> and that equal Liberty as well religious as civil may be universally extended to all the good People of this Common Wealth, Be it Enacted by the General Assembly of the Common Wealth of Virginia and it is hereby Enacted by the Authority of the same that all Dissenters of whatever Denomination from the said Church shall from and after the passing this Act be totally free and exempt from all Levies Taxes and Impositions whatever towards supporting and maintaining the said Church as it now is or may hereafter be established and its Ministers.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0003" id="TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> Provided nevertheless and it is hereby farther Enacted by the Authority aforesaid that the Vestries of the several Parishes where the same hath not been already done shall and may and they are hereby authorized and required at such times as they shall appoint to levy and assess on all Tithables within their respective Parishes as well Dissenters as others all such Salaries and Arrears of Salaries as are or may be due to the Ministers or Incumbents of their Parishes for past Services;<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0004" id="TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> moreover to make such Assessments on all Tithables as will enable the said Vestries to comply with their legal parochial Engagements already entered into and lastly to continue such future Provision for the poor in their respective Parishes as they have hitherto by Law been accustomed to make. And be it farther Enacted by the Authority aforesaid that there shall in all time coming be saved and reserved to the Use of the Church by Law established the several Tracts of Glebe Land already purchased; the Churches and Chapels already built<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0005" id="TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> for the use of the Parishes; all Books Plate &amp; ornaments belonging or appropriated to the use of the said Church and all arrears of Money or Tobacco arising from former Assessments or otherwise and that there shall moreover be saved and reserved to the use of such Parishes as may have received private Donations for the better support of the said Church <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0533">[533<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-01/TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0533.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> and its Ministers the perpetual Benefit and enjoyment of all such Donations.</p>
<p>And whereas great Varieties of Opinions have arisen touching the Propriety of a general Assessment or whether every religious society should be left to voluntary Contributions for the support and maintenance of the several Ministers and Teachers of the Gospel who are of different Persuasions and Denominations, and this Difference of Sentiments cannot now be well accommodated, so that it is thought most prudent to defer this matter to the Discussion and final Determination of a future assembly when the Opinions of the Country in General may be better known. To the End therefore that so important a Subject may in no Sort be prejudged, Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid that nothing in this Act contained shall be construed to affect or influence the said Question of a general Assessment or voluntary Contribution in any respect whatever.</p>
<p>Provided always that in the mean time the Members of the Established Church shall not in any Parish be subject to the payment of a greater tax for the support of the said Church &amp; its Minister than they would have been, had the Dissenters not been exempted from paying their accustomed proportion, any Law to the contrary notwithstanding.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0006" id="TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0006-ptr">6</a></p>
<p>And whereas it is represented that in some Counties Lists of Tithables have been omitted to be taken, For remedy whereof<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0007" id="TSJN-01-01-0240-fn-0007-ptr">7</a> be it further enacted, that the Courts of the several Counties, where it may be necessary, shall have Power &amp; they are hereby required so soon as may be convenient to appoint some of their own Members to take the Lists of Tithables throughout their respective Counties.</p>

Two pages in a clerks hand; one page of amendments in Tazewells hand; one amendment in George Masons hand; and one amendment in Robert Carter Nicholas hand.</p>
<p>It is clear that the Bill as introduced 30 Nov. was drawn up by the committee appointed 19 Nov. not in accord with the six resolutions of the latter date (printed in the note to Document <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span>, above), but in accord with the modification of those resolutions adopted 30 Nov. immediately before the present Bill was introduced. Hence it is plausible to conclude that the Bill as here presented had been agreed upon before TJ left the legislature on 29 Nov. A part of TJs Resolutions of 19 Nov. (Document <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span>) was, however, introduced into the Bill by way of amendment.</p></div>

This text is, except for one alteration, the same as that referred to above as being in George Masons hand.

On the Mason amendment are written in Tazewells hand the following words at the top and bottom respectively: To stand before the Preamble and agreed. The deletion was apparently made before the amendment was offered; for the text as given in Tazewells list of amendments reads as follows:  all and every Act or Statute by whatever Title known  . After Tazewell had copied the amendment thus, the words or Statute were deleted, and the words of Parliament substituted therefor; the Act as adopted reads accordingly. It will be noted that this amendment preserves some of the phraseology and much of the substance of TJs Resolutions of 19 Nov. (Document <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span>, above).</p></div>

The Tazewell list of amendments reads as follows: Page 2. Strike out the second clause &amp; insert And whereas see Treasurers Amendmt. No. 3. The amendment in Robert Carter Nicholas hand is headed by the figure 3 and its text coincides with that of the Act at this point: And Whereas by the Exemptions allowed Dissenters it may be too burthensome in some Parishes to the Members of the established Church if they are still compeld to support the Clergy by certain fixed Salaries &amp; it is judged best &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">for the present</span>&gt; that this should be done for the present by voluntary &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">subscriptions</span>&gt; Contributions; Be it therefore enacted by the Authority aforesaid that so much of an Act of the General Assembly made in the 22d. Year of the Reign of King George the second entitled An Act for the Support of the Clergy &amp; for the regular collecting &amp; paying the Parish Levies or any other Act as provides Salaries for the Ministers &amp; authorizes the Vestries to levy the same, except in the Cases before directed, shall be &amp; the same is hereby suspended until the End of the next Session of Assembly.
