   <p>These words in the Eng. statute narrow its operation. A man adhering to the enemies of the commonwealth, in a foreign country, would certainly not be guilty of treason with us, if these words be retained.

   <p>The statute 25.E.3. directs all other cases of treasons to await the opinion of parliament. This has the effect of negative words excluding all other treasons. As we drop that part of the statute we must, by negative words prevent an inundation of Common law treasons. I strike out the word it therefore, and insert the said cases and no others. Qu. how far those negative words may affect the case of accomplices abovementioned? Tho if their case was within the statute so as that it needed not await the opinion of parliament, it should seem to be also within our act, so as not to be ousted by the negative words.</p>

   <p>By the statute 21.Jac.1.c.27. and act. assembly 1710.c.12. concealment by the mother of the death of a bastard child is made murder. In justification of this it is said that shame is a feeling which operates so strongly on the mind as frequently to induce the mother of such a child to murther it, in order to conceal her disgrace. The act of concealment therefore proves she was influenced by shame, and that influence produces a presumption that she murthered the child. The effect of this law then is to make what in its nature is only presumptive evidence of a murder, conclusive of that fact. To this I answer 1. So many children die before, or soon after birth, that to presume all those murdered, who are found dead, is a presumption which will lead us oftener wrong than right, and consequently would shed more blood than it would save. 2. If the child were born dead, the mother would naturally chuse rather to conceal it, in hopes of still keeping a good character in the neighborhood. So that the act of concealment is far from proving the guilt of murder on the mother. 3. If shame be a powerful affection of the mind, is not parental love also? Is it not the strongest affection known? Is it not greater than even that of self-preservation? While we draw presumptions from shame, one affection of the mind, against the life of the prisoner, should we not give some weight to presumptions from parental love, an affection at least as strong, in favor of life? If concealment of the fact is a presumptive evidence of murther, so strong as to overbalance all other evidence that may possibly be produced to take way the presumption, why not trust the force of this incontestable presumption to the jury, who are, in a regular course, to hear presumptive, as well as positive testimony? If the presumption, arising from the act of concealment, may be destroyed by proof positive or circumstantial to the contrary, why should the legislature preclude that contrary proof? Obj. the crime is difficult to prove, being usually committed in secret. Answ. but circumstantial proof will do, for example, marks of violence, the behavior, countenance &amp;c. of the prisoner &amp;c. and if conclusive proof be difficult to be obtained, shall we therefore fasten irremovably upon equivocal proof? Can we change the nature of what is contestable and make it incontestable? Can we make that conclusive which god and nature have made inconclusive? Solon made no law against parricide, supposing it impossible any one could be guilty of it; and the Persians, from the same opinion, adjudged all who killed their reputed parents to be bastards: and altho parental, be yet stronger than filial affection, we admit saticide proved on the most equivocal testimony, whilst they rejected all proof of an act, certainly not more repugnant to nature, as of a thing impossible, unprovable. See Beccaria .31.</p>

   <p>Qu. if these words may not be omitted? By the Common law one witness in treason was sufficient. Foster 233. Plowd.8.[a.] Mirror c.3..34. Waterhouse on Fortesc. de laud.252.

   <p>Beccaria..32. suicide. Homicides are 1. Justifiable. 2. Excusable. 3. Felonious. For the last, punishments have been already provided. The 1st. are held to be totally without guilt, or rather commendable. The 2d. is in some cases not quite unblamable. These should subject the party to marks of contrition. viz. the killing a man in defence of property; so also in defence of ones person, which is a species of excusable homicide; because altho cases may happen where these also are commendable, yet most frequently they are done on too slight appearance of danger; as in return for a blow, kick, fillup &amp;c. or on a persons getting into a house, not animo furandi, but perhaps Veneris caus &amp;c. Bracton says <span class="foreign" xml:lang="lat">si quis furem nocturnum occiderit, ita demum impune foret, si parcere ei sine periculo suo non poterit, si autem potuit, aliter erit. Item erit si quis <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">hamsokne</span> quae dicitur invasio domus, contra pacem domini regis in domo sua se defenderit, et invasor occisus fuerit; impersecutus et inultus remanebit, si ille quem invasit aliter se defendere non potuit; dicitur enim quod non est dignus habere pacem qui non vult observare eam.</span> L.3.c.23..3. <span class="foreign" xml:lang="lat">Qui latronem occiderit, non tenetur, nocturnum vel diurnum, si aliter periculum evadere non passit; tenetur tamen si possit. Item non tenetur si per infortunium, et non animo et voluntate occidendi, nec dolus, nec culpa ejus inveniatur.</span> L.3.c. 36..1. The statute 24.H.8.c.5. is therefore merely declaratory of the Common law. See on the general subject Puffend. 2.5..10.11.12.16.17. Excusable homicides are by Misadventure, or in self-defence. It is the opinion of some lawyers that the Common law punished these with death, and that the statute of Marlbridge c.26. and Glocester c.9. first took away this by giving them title to a pardon, as matter of right, and a writ of restitution of their goods. See 2.Inst.148. 315. 3.Inst.55. Bracton L.3.c.4..2. Fleta L.1.c.23..14.15. 21.E.3.23. But it is believed never to have been capital. 1.H.P. C.425. 1.Hawk.75. Foster 282. 4.Bl.188. It seems doubtful also whether at Common law the party forfeited all his chattels in this case, or only paid a weregild. Foster, ubi supra, doubts, and thinks it of no consequence, as the statute of Glocester entitles the party to Royal grace, which goes as well to forfeiture as life. To me there seems no reason for calling these Excusable homicides, and the killing a man in defence of property a Justifiable homicide. The latter is less guiltless than misadventure or self-defence.</p>


   <p><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Suicide</span> is by law punishable by forfeiture of chattels. This bill exempts it from forfeiture. The Suicide injures the state less than he who leaves it with his effects. If the latter then be not punished, the former should not. As to the example, we need not fear its influence. Men are too much attached to life to exhibit frequent instances of depriving themselves of it. At any rate, the quasi-punishment of confiscation will not prevent it. For if one be found who can calmly determine to renounce life, who is so weary of his existence here as rather to make experiment of what is beyond the grave, can we suppose him, in such a state of mind, susceptible of influence from the losses to his family by confiscation? That men in general too disapprove of this severity is apparent from the constant practice of juries finding the suicide in a state of insanity; because they have no other way of saving the forfeiture. Let it then be done away.</p>

Ld. Hale however 1.P.C.630. thinks it rape independant of that statute to know carnally a girl under 12. the age of consent. Yet 4.Bl.212. seems to neglect this opinion; and as it was founded on the words of 3.E.1.c.13. and this is with us omitted, the offence of carnally knowing a girl under 12. or 10. years of age will not be distinguished from that of any other.</p>

   <p>Buggery is twofold. 1. with mankind, 2. with beasts. Buggery is the Genus, of which Sodomy and Bestiality are the species. 12.Co.37. says note that Sodomy is with mankind. But Finchs L.B.3.c.24. Sodomitry is a carnal copulation against nature, to wit, of man or woman in the same sex, or of either of them with beasts. 12.Co.36. says it appears by the antient authorities of the law that this was felony. Yet the 25.H.8. declares it felony, as if supposed not to be so. Britton c.9. says that Sodomites are to be burnt. F.N.B.269.b.

   <p>At the Common law the offence of Housebreaking was not distinguished from Burglary, and neither of them from any other larceny. The Statutes at first took away clergy from Burglary, which made a leading distinction between the two offences. Later statutes however have taken clergy from so many cases of housebreaking as nearly to bring the offences together again. These are 23.H.8.c.1. 1.E.6.c.12. 5.&amp;6.E.6.c.9. 3.&amp;4.W.M.c.9. 39.El.c.15. 10.&amp;11.W. 3.c.23. 12.Ann.c.7. See Barr.428. 4.Bl. 240. The circumstances which in these statutes characterise the offence seem to have been occasional and unsystematical. The houses on which Burglary may be committed, and the circumstances which constitute that crime being ascertained, it will be better to define Housebreaking by the same subjects and circumstances, and let the crimes be distinguished only by the hour at which they are committed, and the degree of punishment.</p>

C. 688. After the union of the Heptarchy, i.e. temp. Aethelst. inter 924. and 940. we find it punishable with death as above. So it was int. 1017. and 1035. viz. temp. Cnuti. Ll.Cnuti.61. cited in Notes on Arson. In the time of William the Conqueror it seems to have been made punishable by fine only. Ll.Gul.conq. apud Wilk.p.218.220. This commutation however was taken away by Ll.H.1. anno 1108. <span class="foreign" xml:lang="lat">Si quis in furto vel latrocinio deprehensus fuisset, suspenderetur; sublata wirgildorum, id est, pecuniarae redemptionis lege.</span> Larceny is the felonious taking and carrying away of the personal goods of another. 1. As to the taking, the 3.4.W.M.c.9..5. is not additional to the Common law, but declaratory of it; because where only the care or use, and not the possession, of things is delivered, to take them was larceny at the Common law. The 33.H. 6.c.1. and 21.H.8.c.7. indeed have added to the Common law, by making it larceny in servants to convert things of his masters. But qu. if they should be imitated more than other breaches of trust in general. 2. As to the subject of larceny 4.G.2.c.32. 6.G.3.c.36.[48.] 43.

But the enumeration is unsystematical and in this country, where the produce of the earth is so spontaneous, as to have rendered things of this kind scarcely a breach of civility or good manners, in the eyes of the people, qu. if it would not too much enlarge the field of criminal law? The same may be questioned of 9.G.1.c.22. 13.Car.2.c.10. 10.G.2.c.32. 5.G.3.c.14. 22.&amp;23.Car.2.c.25. 37.E.3. c.19. making it felony to steal animals ferae naturae.</p>

   <p>Breach of prison at the Common law was capital, without regard to the crime for which the party was committed. <span class="foreign" xml:lang="lat">Cum pro criminis qualitate in carcerem recepti fuerint, conspiraverint (ut ruptis vinculis aut fracto carcere) evadant, amplius (quam causa pro qua recepti sunt exposeit) puniendi sunt, videlicet ultimo supplicio, quamvis ex eo crimine innocentes inveniantur, propter quod inducti sunt in carcerem et imparcati.</span> Bracton.L.3.c.9..4. Britt.c.11. Fleta L.1.c.26..4. Yet in the Y.B.Hill.1.H.7.2. Hussey says that by the opinion of Billing and Choke, and all the justices it was a felony in strangers only, but not in the prisoner himself. S.C.Fitz.abr. Coron.48. They are principal felons, not accessories. ib. Whether it was felony in the prisoner at Common law is doubted. Stam.P.C.30.b. The Mirror c.5..1. says <span class="foreign" xml:lang="frm">abusion est a tener escape de prisoner, ou de bruserie del gaole pur peche mortell, car cel usage nest garrant per nul ley, ne in nul part est use forsque in cest realme, et en France, eins [mais]<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-02-0206-fn-0015" id="TSJN-01-02-0206-fn-0015-ptr">15</a> est leu garrantie de ceo faire per la ley de nature.</span> 2.Inst.589. the statute 1.E.2. de frangentibus prisonam restrained the judgment of life and limb for prison breaking to cases where the offence of the prisoner required such judgment.</p>


   <p>It is not only vain, but wicked, in a legislator to frame laws in opposition to the laws of nature, and to arm them with the terrors of death. This is truly creating crimes in order to punish them. The law of nature impels every one to escape from confinement; it should not therefore be subjected to punishment. Let the legislator restrain his criminal by walls, not by parchment. As to strangers breaking prison to enlarge an offender, they should, and may be fairly considered as accessories after the fact. This bill saying nothing of the prisoner releasing himself by breach of jail, he will have the benefit of the first section of the bill, which repeals the judgment of life and death at the Common law.</p>

Both <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscripts ]">MSS</abbr> have been collated with the text as printed in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Report of the Committee of Revisors Appointed by the General Assembly of Virginia in MDCCLXXVI&lt;/i&gt;, Richmond, 1784 ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Report</span></span>, and all important variations among the three texts are indicated in the notes below.

In printed versions these are naturally put at the bottom of the pages, but Jefferson himself placed them in columns, parallel with the text, after the manner of his old law book, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Coke upon Littleton;</span> and, as in the work of the old master, they frequently encroach upon the text.

   <p>In view of the comments below it is pertinent to note that in the first part of <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>) TJ spelled the word forfeit as he was accustomed to do; he changed suddenly to forfiet, going back to the beginning of the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> to alter the spelling from forfeit to forfiet. From that point on in <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>) and throughout <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0505">[505<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0505.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Massachusetts Historical Society, Boston ]">MHi</span>) the word is spelled forfiet as if it had always been TJs habit to do so. This may have been a sudden whim brought about by his conscious imitation of the form of old legal treatises. At any rate, it tends to prove that <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>) is earlier than <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Massachusetts Historical Society, Boston ]">MHi</span>). In these <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscripts ]">MSS</abbr> TJ appears also to have employed the spelling counterfiet for the first and only time.</p>


   <p>The facts noted above concerning the form of the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscripts ]">MSS</abbr> are significant. Indubitably TJ did a vast amount of research in the preparation of this Bill; in the letter just cited he told Wythe that the notes accompanying the text were made, as I went along, for the benefit of my own memory. If this were so, why were these notes arranged in such studied form, blocked out on the pages and with notes separating text occasionally? Why was it necessary to make two copies of the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> in the same form? One cannot escape the conclusion that in this exfoliation of notes and citations, drawn from classical authors and the ancient Anglo-Saxon laws, as well as such modern penologists as Beccaria, TJ was not so much creating a memory-saving device as he was yielding to the temptation to indulge in pedantic ostentationone of the few times in his career in which his enormous learning broke through his natural modesty and reserve (compare these learned notes with the forceful memoranda set forth in Notes and Proceedings on the Disestablishment of the Church, printed under 11 Oct. 1776). This mass of notes and citations, as well as the labored and artificial imitativeness in the form of the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr>, may be partly responsible for the judgment that during the years 17761779, he gave more time to this bill than to all the rest together (Malone, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span>, 269); actually, TJs researches on the Case of Thomas Johnson, and his legislative labors on the court bills, the supply bills, and the land billsto say nothing of his work on other parts of the revisalmust have severally occupied as much time as the Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments. On its surface this Bill has all of the appearance of being an important and prodigious accomplishment, and both TJs own feeling at the time and the obvious learning it required may have led to an exaggerated opinion of its importance. Yet it was less a reform than an effort to bring the penalties of the criminal law into conformity with actual practice; cruel and sanguinary [penal] laws of the past had defeated their own purpose by engaging the benevolence of mankind to withold prosecutions, to smother testimony, or to listen to it with bias. The preamble to this Bill stated in superb language the enlightened ideas of Beccaria and others; but the terms of the law that TJ proposed did little more than restate generally accepted practices concerning capital offenses. In respect to crimes of mayhem, the reliance upon the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">lex talionis</span> contrasts shockingly with the liberal thought of the age. How this last revolting principle came to obtain our approbation, TJ wrote, I do not remember. There remained indeed in our laws a vestige of it in a single case of a slave But the modern mind had left it far in the rear of its advances (Autobiography, <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Paul Leicester Ford, ed., &lt;i&gt;The Writings of Thomas Jefferson&lt;/i&gt;,  Letterpress Edition, N.Y., 18921899 ]">Ford,</span> <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span>, 60). Even at the time of drafting the Bill, TJ felt it unwise to go beyond this vestigial remnant because the principle would be revolting to the humanised feelings of modern times and because the moral effect of public executions of such penalties would be questionable; he therefore urged reconsideration of this part of the Bill (<a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-02-02-0086" class="document">TJ to George Wythe, 1 Nov. 1778</a>). In this same communication, TJ said that he had followed the scale of punishments settled by the Committee, without being entirely satisfied with it; strangely, however, the only documentary evidence remaining of the plan agreed upon by the Committee contains no statement whatever in support of the principle as implemented in the Bill, though it does provide for dismemberment in the case of certain crimes (see Document <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span>, above, and Document <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">iv</span>, Part 5, below, in this series).</p>


   <p>These harsh features of the Bill undoubtedly contributed to its defeat. Madison presented it on 31 Oct. 1785, it was postponed 14 Dec. to the next session, and on 15 Dec. the committee of the whole, to which it had been referred, was discharged from further proceeding on it (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1785, 1828 edn., p. 1215, 92, 94). Two days later Madison reported to James Monroe that this Bill was the one at which we stuck after wading thro the most difficult parts of it (Madison, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Writings</span>, ed. Hunt, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ii</span>, 205). On 1 Nov. 1786 the Bill was again brought in, read twice, referred to the committee of the whole, and amended; it was then engrossed, read the third time, and defeated (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1786, 1828 edn., p. 1617, 67, 86, 96). While it was still in the hands of the committee Madison reported to TJ that the bill  on which we were wrecked last year, has after <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0506">[506<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0506.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> undergoing a number of alterations, got thro a Committee of the whole; but it has not yet been reported to the House, where it will meet with the most vigorous attack. I think the chance is rather against its final passage in that branch of the Assembly, and if it should not miscarry there, it will have another gauntlet to run through the Senate (<a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-10-02-0431" class="document">Madison to TJ, 4 Dec. 1786</a>). The Bill was defeated in the House by a single vote (Madison to Washington, 24 Dec. 1786, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Writings</span>, ed. Hunt, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ii</span>, 303). Madison, in reporting this to TJ, said that the Bill had been altered so as to remove most of the objections as was thought, though he did not explain what alterations had taken place. He did add, however, that The rage against Horse stealers had a great influence on the fate of the Bill. Our old bloody code is by this event fully restored (<a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-11-02-0157" class="document">Madison to TJ, 15 Feb. 1787</a>).</p>


   <p>It is possible that TJ had Bill No. 64 printed in 1779, for Philip Mazzei later asserted that, when he sailed from Virginia for Nantes in June 1779, he carried 5 of Mr. Jeffersons proposals to the Assembly relative to criminal laws (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-03-02-0371" class="document">Mazzei to TJ, 19 Mch. 1780</a>).</p>

Yet, in the passage of this Bill defining treason and establishing its penalty, TJ employed the same phraselevy war against the Commonwealththat he employed in the Bill attainting Philips. Here, however, he requires two sufficient witnesses or confession to establish guilt; in the Bill of Attainder against Philips, he assumed that the legislature had power in summary form to adjudge a man guilty. It is worth noting that, as TJ was completing work on the present Bill, Philips lay under sentence of death at Williamsburg; the alterations indicated in notes 5 and 6 above may have been made by TJ with the Philips case in mind.</p>
