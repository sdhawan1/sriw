   <p>On 9 May 1777 TJ was appointed a member to bring in a Bill for regulating and disciplining the militia; he introduced the Bill 10 May; and during the next month it was amended by both the House and the Senate (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, May 1777, 1827 edn., p. 67, 12, 14, 20, 36, 589, 62, 68, 70, 72). The text here presented (Bill No. 5) follows the text of the Act of 1777 (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W. Hening, &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; ]">Hening,</span> <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ix</span>, 26774) except as indicated in the notes below. The Act of May 1777 (same, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ix</span>, 31314), which provided for regulating and disciplining the militia of the city of Williamsburg and the borough of Norfolk by incorporating the students, professors, and others liable to militia duty in a special category, but subject to the same regulations, orders, and penalties as set forth in the general militia Act passed at the same session, was disregarded in Bill No. 5, thereby making the exemption of professors and students absolute; the special Act relating to Williamsburg and Norfolk was incorporated in the Act of 1784 (same, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xi</span>, 494). The latter Act, as indicated in the notes below, elaborated the militia law and incorporated many of the lessons learned during the Revolution; such as that Steubens plan of discipline should be followed in training the militia; it also embraced much of Bill No. 5 as here presented and also of Bill No. 6. For the treatment of Bill No. 5 by the General Assembly in 1785, see notes to Bill No. 6.</p>

   <p>The Acts of 1784 and 1785 include a preamble which indicates in part why the Act of 1777 and Bills No. 5 and 6 of the Committee of Revisors were considered inadequate: the defence and safety of the commonwealth depend upon having its citizens properly armed and taught the knowledge of military duty, and the different laws heretofore enacted being found inadequate to such purposes, and in order that the same may be formed into one plain and regular system (same, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xi</span>, 476; <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xii</span>, 9).</p>

   <p>The Acts of 1784 and 1785 omit the phrase hired servants and apprentices and alter the age limits to 18 and 50 years respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0003-ptr" id="TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0003">3</a>

   <p>The Act of 1777 does not include the following exemptions allowed by Bill No. 5: clerks of the houses of assembly, the presidents, professors, and students of the College of William and Mary and of Hampden-Sidney, inspectors of tobacco, Quakers, and Menonists. The Act of 1777 includes the following not in Bill No. 5: clerks of the treasury and persons solely employed in manufacturing firearms. The Acts of 1784 and 1785 enlarged the exemptions by the addition of auditors and their clerks, the solicitor general and his clerks, clerks of the treasury, the register of the land office, the deputy-register, and clerks of the register, custom house officers; it excluded clerks of the houses of assembly and of the navy board, Quakers and Menonists. The exclusion of Quakers and Menonists from the Acts of 1777, 1784, and 1785 is an indication of TJs authorship of Bill No. 5; see note 2 to Bill No. 6.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0004-ptr" id="TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0004">4</a>

   <p>The Act of 1777 reads whether of the continent or this commonwealth; the use of the word colonial here and elsewhere in Bill No. 5 may be another indication of TJs authorship, since Bill No. 6, which TJ drew, also used the inappropriate word colonial.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0005-ptr" id="TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0005">5</a>

   <p>The Act of 1777 reads: January and February; the Act of 1784 provided that each company should muster once in every three months, each regiment in March or April, and a general muster be held in October or November.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0006-ptr" id="TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0006">6</a>

   <p>The Act of 1777 reads: at a convenient place, near the centre of the county.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0007-ptr" id="TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0007">7</a>

   <p>The Act of 1777 provided for an elaborate manner of giving notice of muster days, through the regular chain of command from the county lieutenant down to the individual militiaman. This proviso was not incorporated in Bill No. 5, but was included and elaborated in the Acts of 1784 and 1785.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0008-ptr" id="TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0008">8</a>

   <p>The terms of the Acts of 1784 and 1785 respecting arms reflect some of the lessons learned during the Revolution: captains, lieutenants, and ensigns were to carry swords and espontoons; non-commissioned officers and privates, a good clean musket, carrying an ounce ball and having a barrel three feet eight inches long, twenty cartridges, a knapsack, a canteen, a pound of good powder and four pounds of lead, including twenty blind cartridges; each sergeant was required to carry a pair of molds for casting musket balls; and the counties westward of the Blue Ridge were not required to be armed with muskets but might bear rifles instead. The Act of 1777 had provided that non-commissioned officers and privates should carry a rifle and tomahawk or a good firelock and bayonet.</p>

   <p>The Act of 1777 includes at this point a provision for penalizing poor soldiers and others guilty of carrying arms out of the county; this was also included in Act of 1784. The omission of this provision from Bill No. 5, together with those described in notes 7, above, and 18, below, is another indication that, in drawing this Bill in 1779, TJ may have depended upon an original bill drafted by him in 1777.</p>
</div>

   <p>The words and also of all quakers  not yet divided into tenths were not included in the Act of 1777.</p>
</div>

   <p>The Act of 1777 adds the following at this point: Every officer failing to furnish himself with one pound of powder shall forfeit and pay ten shillings, and the same for failing to furnish himself with four pounds of ball; and every soldier failing therein shall likewise be liable for the same penalties.</p>
</div>

   <p>Instead of the foregoing, the Act of 1777 provides authority for collection of fines by the sheriff.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0018-ptr" id="TSJN-01-02-0147-fn-0018">18</a>

   <p>The Act of 1777 includes a section at this point requiring small details of officers and men to make monthly inspections of all negro quarters, and other places suspected of entertaining unlawful assemblies of slaves, servants, or other disorderly persons  or any others strolling about from one plantation to another, without a pass The Act of 1784 also included such a provision; see notes 7 and 9, above.</p>
