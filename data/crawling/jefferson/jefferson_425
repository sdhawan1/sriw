<p>Nevertheless the general assembly tho provoked by the example of their enemi[es] to a departure from that generosity which so honourably distinguishes the civilized nations of the present age yet desirous to conduct themselves with moderation and temper by an act passed at their session in the year 1777 took measures for preventing what had been the property of British subjects within this commonwealth from waste and destruction by putting the same into the hands and under the management of commissioners appointed for that purpose that so it might be in their power if reasonable at a future day to re[sto]re to the former proprietors the full value thereof:</p>
<p>And whereas it is found that the said property is liable to be lost, wasted and impaired without greater attention in the officers of government than is consistent with the discharge of their public duties and that from the advanced price at which the same would now sell it may be most for the benefit of the former owners, if the same should be restored to them hereafter or to the public if not so restored that the sale thereof should take place at this time and the proceeds be lodged in the public treasury subject to the future direction of the legislature:</p>
<p>Be it therefore enacted by the General assembly that so much of the act beforementioned as may be supposed to have suspended the operation of the laws of escheat and forfeiture shall be hereby <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0281">[281<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0281.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> repealed and that all the property real and personal within the commonwealth belonging at this time to any British subject or which did belong to any British subject at the time such escheat or forfeiture may have taken place shall be deemed to be vested in the commonwealth the said<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-02-0124-fn-0001" id="TSJN-01-02-0124-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> real estate, by way of escheat and the said personal estate by forfeiture:</p>
<p>The Governor with the advice of council so far as their information will enable them and the commissioners of the tax within their several counties aided by their assessors shall forthwith institute proper proceedings of escheat and forfeiture for all such property real and personal in which they shall be advised and assisted by the several attornies for the commonwealth.</p>

   <p>On 4 June 1779 a committee composed of Charles Carter, Mason, Henry, Baker, Lyne, Thomas Hite, Munford, and Page was ordered to bring in a Bill providing for the sale of all real and personal property owned by enemy aliens. This Bill was reported by Harvie (not a member of the committee) on 19 June; it passed the first two readings the same day and was committed to the committee of the whole; on 22 June it was debated by the committee and several amendments offered; on 23 June it was read the third time and passed, being carried to the Senate by Carter (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, May 1779, 1827 edn., p. 35, 59, 61, 62). TJ may have drafted the Bill before the session began (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-02-02-0095" class="document">George Mason to TJ, 3 Apr. 1779</a>); since he became governor on 2 June, he was obliged to entrust the measure to his colleague from Albemarle, John Harvie.</p>


   <p>It is to be noted that TJ, in the preamble to this Act, does not rest its justification upon the recommendation of the Continental Congress of 27 Nov. 1777 that real and personal estates of disloyal persons be seized and sold and the proceeds converted into Continental Loan Office certificates (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.

Van Tyne, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Loyalists</span>, appendixes B and C, contains an analysis of legislation against the loyalists in various states. In some states confiscation was effected through acts of attainder, but Virginia passed only one such act during the Revolutionthat against Josiah Philips, which TJ drew. Instead, sequestration was effected, as in the case of confiscation of property in England, under the customary process of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">office found</span>. This was a process of inquiry, or inquest by virtue of office, held by the sovereigns sheriff, coroner, or escheator to determine the validity of the sovereigns title to the personal or real property involved (Tucker, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Blackstone</span>, 1803, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ii</span>, 60). It is interesting to observe that TJ, whose legislative reforms generally were in advance of those undertaken by other states, should in this instance have been the only one to advance such a traditional legal concept to effect confiscation. It is impossible to determine how much property of loyalists was sold under this law; the auditors accounts <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0284">[284<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0284.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> from 1779 to 1795 show a total of 3,041,167; With the exception of 13,126, this money was paid to the commonwealth prior to 1782 in depreciated paper currency; the benefits to the state were small (Harrell, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Loyalism in Virginia</span>, 1926, p. 8498). Not all of this property was sold. The clauses at the conclusion of TJs Bill concerning lots in Richmond show that escheated real estate there was to have title confirmed in the commonwealth through process of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">office found</span> and the lots used for such purposes as the state might direct. Under this clause, the property of James McDowell was set apart for the auditors office; that of French Crawford for the treasurers office; that of Ninian Minzies was leased to Penet, Windel, &amp; Company as a repair shop for the ordnance department; and, until the completion of the capitol in 1789, the General Assembly met in a house that had belonged to Cunningham and Company (same, p. 99). With materials scarce and building costs high, this use of loyalist property by the state was one that resulted in considerable benefit to the commonwealth. Yet neither the sequestration of debts due British subjects nor the confiscation of loyalists property had the effect that TJ expected of stabilizing state finances and of halting the rapid inflation of the paper money.</p>
