<p>I flattered myself with the hopes of seeing you on my return to Philadelphia, but found you had set out for Boston with a view to embark at that place. I have therefore sent by a conveyance directly for France three Commissions for negotiating, if necessary, additional treaties of Commerce with France, the United Netherlands and Sweden, and a duplicate of the Instructions.</p>
  <p><a href="#TSJN-01-07-0263-kw-0001" title="[explained in note]" id="TSJN-01-07-0263-ks-0001" class="keyword">The affair of Longchamps is still undecided</a>. When the matter was first brought before Congress, he had absconded and it was supposed had fled to some other state. Upon this Congress passed an Act recommending it to the several states to issue a proclamation and offer a reward of five hundred dollars for apprehending him so that he might be brought to justice. Before this could take effect he was apprehended and confined in prison but soon after admitted to bail. As his going at large gave offence he was delivered up by his bail and again confined. But having applied for a writ of habeas corpus he was brought before Justice Bryan and on his return found means to escape from the Officer who had him in custody. <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0306">[306<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0306.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> However he was again taken in a few days and is now confined and to take his trial on the 24 of this Month. As I purpose to attend the trial, I shall be able to give you a more particular account of the result.</p>
<p>On the 3d. of June Congress was adjourned agreeably to the act of 26 April to meet at Trenton on the 30th. October. Previous to the adjournment they appointed a committee of the States and defined their powers. On the 4 June the Committee met and elected Mr. Hardy chairman. I took the opportunity of mentioning to the committee the necessity I was under to return to Philadelphia and expressed a wish that I might be indulged with leave to remain there unless something should occur to render my attendance on them necessary. This they readily and unanimously granted, which was the more satisfactory as they could not obtain the votes of nine states for their meeting at Philadelphia. They then adjourned to meet again at Annapolis on the 26 instant. I had some doubts of their being able to form a Committee, but as delegates from Georgia are come on and Delaware it is said will attend I fancy they will have a quorum on the 28 and have great hopes they will be so tired of their situation in Annapolis, that they will be induced to remove to the Northward. I wish Congress were settled. This mode of rambling is neither consistent with dignity nor convenience. But I find we must go the common round of Nations before us and learn wisdom from our own experience. With great respect, I am Dear Sir Your obedient humble servt.,</p>

<p>P.S. I take the liberty of enclosing a letter to Mr. Jay.

There are several possible explanations for this: (1) Thomson sent a duplicate of the present letter by a different vessel; (2) one of the entries may pertain to the letter of 18 June to the commissioners (see following); (3) since TJ in his <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-07-02-0373" class="document">reply to Thomson of 11 <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0307">[307<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0307.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> Nov. 1784</a> mentioned only one letter of 18 June and since it is very unlikely that Thomson wrote TJ two letters of that date in addition to the one to the commissioners, one of the entries is in error.

<p><a id="TSJN-01-07-0263-kw-0001" class="keywordref" title="jump to The affair of longchamps is still undecided in text" href="#TSJN-01-07-0263-ks-0001">The affair of longchamps is still undecided</a>: The problem raised by Longchamps attack on Marbois-the establishment of penalties for interference with the rights of diplomatic officials-was not really settled until the Articles of Confederation had given way to the federal Constitution and Congress had been empowered to deal effectively with offenses against the law of nations (Art. <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span>, sect. viii, par. 10). All that Congress could do in 1784 was to recommend to the states that a reward of $500 be offered for Longchamps capture (see resolution under date of 29 May 1784). President John Dickinson of Pennsylvania issued a proclamation in accordance with this resolution on 4 June (a copy of the broadside is reproduced in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography&lt;/i&gt; ]">PMHB</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">lxiii</span> [1939], p. 297), and on 10 and 12 July 1784 Longchamps was tried before the Supreme Court of that state on charges of assault and battery. He was convicted, fined one hundred crowns and costs, sentenced to twenty-one months in jail, and compelled to give bond guaranteeing good behavior for seven years (Alfred Rosenthal, The Marbois-Longchamps Affair, same, p. 294301, and based on a dossier kept by Marbois on the affair and now in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia ]">PHi</span>). But this merely punished the offender for assault and battery and did not solve the larger problem of Congress power to deal with such offenses. The states lacked legislation on the subject, and Pennsylvania and Virginia were the only two that enacted laws in response to Congress appeal. The incident that gave rise to these laws continued to plague relationships between France and America for over a year. Indeed, Thomson expressed to Franklin the view that The atrocious and unprovoked outrage lately committed in this city by one Long-champs, a vagabond Frenchman, seems to carry strong marks of a premeditated design to embroil us with France and what makes this still more probable is the palliating account given of this affair in a paper newly set up here as if for the purpose entitled the Courier de lAmerique, and which is conducted by Boinod &amp; Gaillard two strangers who came to this place last fall about the same time as Longchamps. The whole complexion of this paper evidences a marked inveteracy against France and a strong desire to excite fears and jealousies or at least to give an unfavorable impression of her. I am glad to find that the zeal of the Authors has hurried them into so palpable a manifestation of their design, and that suspicions are already raised which I trust will guard against the influence of the poison they mean to convey. I send you the Courier de lAmerique as far as published and some other papers of the day. I also send the copies of some originals which will explain the circumstances of the outrage committed by Longchamps and the measures taken by government in consequence thereof. I must inform you that the Judges have not yet given an answer to the last letter of the president. The question Whether Longchamps can be legally delivered up by Council according to the claim made by the late Minister of France was publickly argued by lawyers before the Judges who still have it under advisement. In the meanwhile L. is confined in prison. The matter is laid before the legislature who have now under consideration a bill which I have no doubt will pass for effectually securing the rights and immunities of public ministers and punishing the violators of them. It may not be amiss to acquaint you that from his own shewing it appears that Longchamps had been an Officer in the French service, that in 1775 he came to America and went to our camp then before Boston where he was cordially received; that after being in our camp and about headquarters for some weeks he took the advantage of a pass given for the purpose of going into the country to slip into Boston which we were besieging; that he wanted permission of General Gage to come again into our camp, but for some reason that does not appear it was not granted. That in our camp he passed by the name of Longchamps and in Boston by that of Blutier. In short from many circumstances there is reason to suspect that at that time he either was or wished to be employed as a spy of the British general. Whether his late <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0308">[308<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-07/TSJN-01-07-02-pb-0308.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> crime is the effect of sudden passion or the result of some premeditated plan may possibly in time be manifested (Thomson to Franklin, 13 Aug. 1784, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia ]">PHi</span>). <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Le Courier de lAmerique</span>, the first French newspaper in America, continued its sensational use of the episode and, upon Marbois declining Boinod &amp; Gaillards offer to print his version, dealt so harshly with him that he complained to Vergennes, charging that the aim of the publishers was to sow discord between the United States and France.
