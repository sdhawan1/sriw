<p>Be it enacted by the General Assembly that there shall be a standing Board of Auditors for Public Accounts, to consist of three persons to be chosen from time to time, as vacancies shall happen, by joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly, and to continue in office until removed by the joint vote of both the said Houses; and where any person so appointed shall refuse to act, resign, or die, during the recess of Assembly, it shall be lawful for the Governor with advice of the Council of state, to appoint some other fit and able person to act in his stead, until the next meeting of the General Assembly. The Auditors so appointed shall not be capable of acting until they shall have taken the oath of fidelity to the commonwealth, and also an oath impartially and honestly to execute the duties of their office; which oaths, during the sessions of the High Court of Chancery, shall be taken before the said court, and during their vacation shall be taken before some judge thereof, and by him shall be certified to his next succeeding court and entered of record: Any two of the said Auditors so qualified, shall have power to proceed to business. The Auditors now in office, by virtue of former appointments, shall continue to act and be considered to all future intents and purposes as if they had been appointed by virtue of this act. The said Board of Auditors are authorised and required to state and keep an exact account of all articles of debit or credit hereafter to arise between this commonwealth and the United States of America, or any of them, or any other state, to raise and keep accounts with all officers of civil government who are intitled to receive from the public treasury salaries or wages fixed by law: To enquire into all legal expenditures for the army, navy, or militia of this commonwealth, and on requisition from the Governor, with the advice of Council, to give their warrant on the Treasurer for the advance of monies for such purposes, debiting therewith the <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0371">[371<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0371.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1');

such sums in gross however, to be given but once to any one person, and not to exceed one years pay, and such annual pension not to exceed full pay: To enter in account all draughts on the Treasurer for money by the Governor and Council for the public service: To certify such entry to the Treasurer for payment, and to audit in due time the expenditure thereof: To give warrants on the Treasurer for the payment or advance of wages to our Delegates in Congress, debiting each Delegate respectively with the warrant given in his name, and requiring account thereof to be rendered within three months after the expiration of his appointment: To audit all accounts for wages due to the members of the General Assembly for attendance therein, or for their travelling allowances, such attendance and allowances being previously entered with the clerk of the House, of which such member is, in separate books to be kept for that purpose and to lie during the session on the table of the House, and being certified by the said clerk, to be so entered; and to audit accounts for salaries or wages to the officers and attendants of the two Houses: To settle the expences of sending for the members of either House by special messengers: Of providing robes for the Speakers and clerks of both Houses, maces, lights, fuel, blank books, parchment, paper, and other articles necessary for the use of either House, or of the Governor and Council, the Boards of War or Trade, Treasurer, Register, or the Superior Courts of <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0372">[372<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0372.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1');

<p>And it is farther enacted, that it shall not be lawful for the Treasurer to pay or receive any money on account of the public but on warrant or certificate from the Board of Auditors, unless in cases where any future act of Assembly shall in express words, and not by inference or implication only, declare that in that particular case it is to be understood as the intention, that the claim specified by such act shall not be audited in the regular course, save only that the salaries of the said Auditors, together with the accounts for the expences of their office for fuel, blank books, paper, presses for the preservation of their books and papers, and other implements necessary for the use of their office, shall be examined and certified for payment to the Treasurer by the Governor and Council. The said Auditors shall be allowed a clerk of accounts and an assistant clerk, to be appointed by themselves from time to time at their will, who, before entering on the exercise of their office, shall take the like oath and in like manner as is before directed for the said Auditors to take. Where the Auditors acting according to their discretion and judgment shall disallow or abate any article of demand against the commonwealth, and any person shall think himself agrieved thereby, he shall be at liberty to petition the High Court of <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0374">[374<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0374.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> Chancery or the General Court, according to the nature of his case, for redress, and such court shall proceed to do right thereon, and a like petition shall be allowed in all other cases to any other person who is intitled to demand against the commonwealth any right in law or equity.</p>

   <p>With certain exceptions, Bill No. 11 is a restatement of the Act adopted Oct. 1778 for establishing a board of Auditors for publick accounts, which in turn repealed an Act of 1776 for a similar purpose and greatly enlarged the powers of the board of auditors as created in 1776 (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W. Hening, &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; ]">Hening,</span> <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ix</span>, 2457, 53640; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1778, 1827 edn., p. 94, 95, 98, 105, 107, 111). Most of the differences between the Act of 1778 and Bill No. 11 were minor, but one was of some importance since it concerned a subject that had consumed a great part of the attention of the legislature since 1776that is, the proviso in the Bill granting the board authority to allow pensions to men disabled in military service or to the widows of those killed in such service.</p>


   <p>Bill No. 11 was presented by Madison 31 Oct. 1785. It passed the second reading and was referred to the committee of the whole. On 28 Nov., however, another bill to amend the Act of 1778 was ordered to be brought in. It was introduced on 1 Dec., was amended by both houses, and, on 10 Jan. 1786, was passed under the new title An act for the reform of certain public Boards. This Act dealt not only with the duties of the auditors but also with those of the solicitor and the treasurer (same, Oct. 1785, 1828 edn., p. 1215, 59, 68, 119, 129, 130, 136, 142; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W. Hening, &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; ]">Hening,</span> <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xii</span>, 1069). This did not alter in any important way the authority granted by the Act of 1778; its chief purpose was to make specific allocations of authority to each of the three auditors. One auditor was charged with the duty of stating and balancing all accounts up to 31 Dec. 1785; another was authorized to examine, settle, and audit all claims and accounts as provided for by the Act of 1778; and the other was required to open a new set of books of account as of 1 Jan. 1786, in which every public fund created by the laws of appropriation, by way of debt and credit, shewing the annual product and application of each, and the balance thereof, on the last day of December in every year should be stated, together with the public account against the treasurer and against sheriffs, escheators, clerks of the different counties, &amp;c. In short, the reform effected by this Act was one of administration, not of authority; hence the alterations in the authority of the board of auditors proposed by Bill No. 11, including the extensive delegation of power over pension grants, were not adopted and apparently no further action was taken on the Bill.</p>
