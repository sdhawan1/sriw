        <h2>III. Jeffersons Draft of a Constitution for Virginia</h2>
        
        <div class="docbody"> <p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">To the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and all others whom it may concern, the Delegates of the said Commonwealth<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0002" id="TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> send greeting.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1em;">It is known to you and to the world that the government of Great Britain, with which the American states were not long since connected, assumed over them an authority which to some of them appeared<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0003" id="TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> unwarrantable and oppressive; that they endeavoured to enforce this authority by arms, and that the states of New Hampshire, Massachusets, Rhode island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0295">[295<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-06/TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0295.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> South Carolina and Georgia, considering resistance, with all its train of horrors, as a lesser evil than abject submission, closed in the appeal to arms. It hath pleased the sovereign disposer of all human events, to give to this appeal an issue favourable to the rights of these states, to enable them to reject for ever all dependance on a government which had shewn itself so capable of abusing the trusts reposed in it, and to obtain from that government a solemn and explicit acknowlegement that we are free, sovereign and independant states. During the progress of that war through which we had to labour for the establishment of our rights, the legislature of the commonwealth of Virginia found it necessary to establish a form of government<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0004" id="TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> for preventing anarchy and pointing our efforts to the two important objects of war against our invaders and peace and happiness among ourselves. But this, like all other their acts of legislation, being subject to be changed<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0005" id="TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> by subsequent legislatures, possessing equal powers with themselves, it has been thought expedient that it should receive those amendments which time and trial have suggested, and be rendered permanent by a power superior to that of the ordinary legislature. The General assembly therefore of this state recommended it to the good people thereof to chuse delegates to meet in General convention with powers to form a constitution of government for them,<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0006" id="TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0006-ptr">6</a> to which all laws present and future shall be subordinate; and in compliance with this recommendation they have thought proper to make choice of us, and to vest us with powers for this purpose.</p>
          <p>We therefore the Delegates chosen by the said good people of this state for the purpose aforesaid, and now assembled in General convention do, in execution of the authority with which we are invested, establish the following Constitution<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0007" id="TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0007-ptr">7</a> of government for the said state of Virginia.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0008" id="TSJN-01-06-0262-fn-0008-ptr">8</a></p>
