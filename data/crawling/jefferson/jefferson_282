<p>The said Court shall have power from time to time to appoint a Clerk who shall hold his office during good behaviour and be entitled to such fees or Salary as shall be established by the legislature.</p>
<p>All original process to bring any person to answer any bill, petition, or information in the said Court and all subsequent process thereupon shall be issued and signed by the Clerk in the name of the Commonwealth and bear teste by the first Commissioner<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0006" id="TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0006-ptr">6</a> of the said Court; shall be returnable to the first or seventeenth day of the Term which shall be next after the suing out such process and may be executed at any time before the return day thereof. And if any process shall be executed so late that the Sheriff hath not reasonable time to return the same before the day of appearance and thereupon any subsequent process shall be awarded the Sheriff shall not execute such subsequent process but shall return the first process by him executed on which there shall be the same proceedings, as if it had been returned in due time, and all Appeals from decrees in Chancery obtained in any inferior Court shall be made to the third day of the next term.</p>
<p>In all Suits in the said Court the following rules and methods shall be observed that is to say</p>
<p>The Complainant shall file his Bill within one Calendar month after the day of appearance, or may be ruled on the requisition of the defendant to file such Bill and if he fails to do so within one Calendar month after such rule the suit shall be dismissed with costs and upon the Complainants dismissing his Bill, or the defendants dismissing the same for want of prosecution the Complainant shall pay costs to be taxed by the Clerk of the Court: for which costs a subpoena or other process of contempt may issue returnable on any return day.</p>
<p>The Complainant may amend his Bill before the defendant or his Attorney hath taken out a copy thereof, or in a small matter afterwards without paying costs, but if he amend in a material <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0613">[613<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-01/TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0613.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> point after such copy obtained, he shall pay the defendant all costs occasioned thereby.</p>
<p>If the defendant shall not appear on the day of appearance (which in all cases shall be the second day after the term to which the subpoena is returnable) an attachment shall be awarded and issued against him returnable to the next term, which being returned executed, if the defendant doth not appear or being brought into Court upon any such process shall obstinately refuse to answer, the Complainants Bill shall be taken pro: confesso<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0007" id="TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0007-ptr">7</a> and the matter thereof decreed accordingly.</p>
<p>The defendant within three calendar months after his appearance and Bill filed shall put in his answer to be filed with the Clerk in the office, at the expiration of which time, if no answer be filed the Clerk upon request shall issue an Attachment returnable to the next court, and if no answer be filed upon the return of such Attachment executed, the Complainants Bill shall be taken as confessed and the matter thereof decreed and if the Attachment be returned not executed, an Attachment with proclamations, and such subsequent process of contempt may issue as was heretofore issued out of the General Court sitting in Chancery in like cases.</p>
<p>No process of contempt shall issue unless the subpena be returned served by a sworn officer or affidavit be made of the service thereof.</p>
<p>Every defendant may swear to his answer before any judges of this or of the General Court or any justice of the peace.</p>
<p>When a cross Bill shall be preferred,<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0008" id="TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0008-ptr">8</a> the defendant or defendants to the first Bill shall answer thereto, before the defendant or defendants to the cross Bill shall be compellable to answer such cross bill.</p>
<p>The Complainant shall reply or file exceptions within two Calendar months after the answer shall have been put in. If he fails so to do the defendant may give a rule to reply with the Clerk of the Court which being expired, and no replication or exceptions filed the suit shall be dismissed with costs, but the Court may order the same to be retained if they see cause on payment of costs.</p>
<p>If the Complainants Attorney shall except against any answer as insufficient he may file his exceptions and give rule with the Clerk to make a better answer within two Calendar months, and if within that time the defendant shall put in a sufficient answer the same shall be received without costs, but if any defendant insist on the sufficiency of his answer, or neglect, or refuse to put in a sufficient answer, or shall put in another insufficient answer, <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0614">[614<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-01/TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0614.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> the Plaintiff may set down his exceptions to be argued the next term in Court and after the expiration of such rule, or any second insufficient answer put in no further or other answer shall be received, but upon payment of costs.</p>
<p>If upon argument the Complainants exceptions shall be over ruled or the defendants answer adjudged insufficient, the Complainant shall pay to the defendant or the defendant to the Complainant such costs as shall be allowed by the Court.</p>
<p>Upon a second answer adjudged insufficient costs shall be doubled. If a defendant shall put in a third insufficient answer which shall be so adjudged<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0009" id="TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0009-ptr">9</a> the Complainant may go on with the subsequent process of contempt as if no answer had been put in.</p>
<p>Rules to plead, answer, reply, rejoin or other proceedings not before particularly mentioned, when necessary, shall be given from month to month with the Clerk in his office, and shall be entered in a rule book for the information of all Parties, Attornies or Solicitors concerned therein.</p>
<p>No defendant shall be admitted to put in a rejoinder unless it be filed on or before the expiration of the rule to rejoin, but the Complainant may proceed to the examination of witnesses.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0010" id="TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0010-ptr">10</a></p>
<p>After an Attachment with proclamation returned, no plea or demurrer shall be received, unless by order of Court upon motion.</p>
<p>If the Complainant conceives any plea or demurrer to be naught, either for the matter or manner of it he may set it down with the Clerk to be argued. Or if he thinks the plea good but not true he may take issue upon it and proceed to trial by jury as hath been heretofore used in other causes in Chancery where trial hath been by jury. And if thereupon the plea shall be found false the Complainant shall have the same advantages as if it had been so found by verdict at common Law.</p>
<p>If a plea or demurrer be over ruled, no other plea or demurrer shall be thereafter received but the defendant shall answer the allegations of the Bill.</p>
<p>If the Complainant shall not proceed to reply to, or set for hearing as before mentioned any plea or demurrer before the second Court after filing the same, the Bill may be dismissed of course with costs.</p>
<p>Upon a plea or demurrer, argued, and over ruled, costs shall be paid, as where an answer is judged insufficient, and the defendant shall answer within two Calendar months after, but if adjudged good the defendant shall have his costs.</p>
<p>If any defendant shall obstinately insist on a demurrer after the <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0615">[615<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-01/TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0615.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> same hath been over ruled by the Court, and shall refuse to answer, the Bill shall be taken as confessed and the matter thereof decreed.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0011" id="TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0011-ptr">11</a></p>
<p>After any Bill filed and before the defendant hath answered, upon oath made that any of the Complainants witnesses are aged or infirm or going out of the country, the Clerk may issue a commission for taking the examination of such witnesses de bene esse the party praying such commission giving reasonable notice to the adverse party of the time and place of taking the depositions.</p>
<p>All matters of fact material to the determination of the cause which in the course of the proceedings shall be affirmed by the one party and denied by the other, shall be tried<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0012" id="TSJN-01-01-0267-fn-0012-ptr">12</a> by Jury, for which purpose an issue or issues shall be made up by declaration and plea as hath heretofore been used in Chancery when issues have been specially directed to be made up and tried by Jury.</p>
<p>And for rendering the said trials more convenient to parties and witnesses, a venue shall be laid in the Declaration a transcript of the record deliverd to the Clerk of Assise where the said venue is laid and a trial be had before the judge of the same assise in every case in such manner as is directed by law in actions at the common law, saving to the Defendant the same benefit of evidence by his own answer as hath been heretofore allowed in trials before the Court of Chancery. Nevertheless the judges for good cause to them shewn, may direct the venue to be changed in any cause or may order any trial to be had at their bar and not at the Assises.</p>
<p>The judge of Assise shall certifie under his seal upon or with each record transmitted, the verdict which shall be given therein, together with such demurrers, or exceptions to evidence, or to the opinion of the Court as he shall be desired by either party to certifie, which verdict and other certificates the Clerk of Assise shall return in convenient time to the office of the Clerk in Chancery.</p>

Read the first time. Novr. 8th. Read 2d. time &amp; committed; amendments noted below and the two drafts distinguished by being referred to as 1776 Bill and 1777 Bill. Except for TJs alterations and amendments in 1776 and 1777, both texts are almost identical with each other and with thelaw as enacted; hence the whole legislative history of the Bill is traced here.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that TJ was the author of this Bill in 1776. The best account of his purpose in advocating such a court is set forth in his letter to Mazzei of 28 Nov. 1785, where he regards chancery jurisdiction ideally as making the administration of justice progressive almost in equal pace with the progress of commerce and refinement of morality; he also notes that, to guard  effectually against the dangers apprehended from a court of Chancery, the legislature of Virginia  very wisely introduced into it the trial by jury for all matters of fact. This Bill was introduced by TJ, 25 Nov., when it was read the first time; 29 Nov., it was read a second time and referred to Committee of the Whole; 3 Dec., considered by House and amendments agreed to; 13 Dec., it was postponed to next session (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1776, 1828 edn., p. 69, 75, 80, 96). (These amendments, noted below, aid in proving that this is the 1776 draft; some were incorporated in 1777 Bill and some were disregarded in that Bill. Notes below also indicate priority of this text; since the Senate at no time offered amendments in 1776 or 1777 Bills, the amendments to this text can only have been those made by the House in 1776.) On 30 Oct. 1777 TJ was appointed to committee to bring in Bill on this subject; Bill introduced by Nicholas, 7 Nov.; read second time, 8 Nov., and referred <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0620">[620<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-01/TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0620.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> to Committee of Whole; 2 Jan. 1778, amended by Committee of Whole; 3 Jan., read third time and passed, Prentis carrying Bill to Senate; 9 Jan., agreed to by Senate (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1778, 1827 edn., p. 8, 15, 17, 96, 99, 108; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W.
