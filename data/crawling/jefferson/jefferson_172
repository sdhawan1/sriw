This copy of TJs constitution was folded and docketed in correct legislative form. At the top of the two sheets, after it was folded, TJ endorsed this title on his substantive law: A <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Bill</span> for new modelling the form of government, &amp; for establishing the fundamental principles thereof in future. Below this, he added: It is proposed that this bill, after correction by the Convention, shall be referred by them to the people to be assembled in their respective counties and that the suffrages of two thirds of the counties shall be requisite to establish it.</p>
<p>The provenance of this text is given in a memorandum of Victor H. Paltsits (Ford Papers, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ New York Public Library, New York City ]">NN</span>, 1 Feb. 1916): the document was acquired from Cassius F. Lee, Jr., of Alexandria, by William Evarts Benjamin, then a well-known dealer of New York City who acted in the matter for some woman whose name is not revealed. Alexander Maitland purchased it of Benjamin for the Lenox Library. Shortly after this text was brought to light in 1890, efforts were made to identify it as the copy that TJ had given to George Wythe to convey to the Virginia Convention (D. R. Anderson, Jefferson and the Va. Const., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Amer. Hist. Rev.</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xxi</span> [19151916], 751). A close comparison of the copy found among Wythes papers at his death in 1806 and printed with meticulous accuracy in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Richmond Enquirer</span>, 20 June 1806, clearly establishes the identity of that copy and the one now in the New York Public Library, here designated as the Third Draft (Boyd, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Declaration of Independence</span>, 1945, p. 445). In 1825 TJ wrote: I  drew a sketch or outline of a Constitution, with a preamble, which I sent to Mr. Pendleton, president of the convention . He informed me afterwards by letter, that he received it on the day on which the Committee of the whole had reported to the House the plan they had agreed to  (TJ to Augustus B. Woodward, 3 Apr. 1825). It has been assumed that this was a mistake of memory on TJs part and that he confused Pendleton with Wythe (Hazelton, p. 451). Wythe reported to TJ that the one you put into my hands was <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">shewn</span> [italics supplied] to those chiefly engaged in framing the Constitution (<a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-01-02-0195" class="document">Wythe to TJ, 27 July 1776</a>). This, together with the significant fact that Wythes copy remained among his papers, indicates that TJ was correct in saying he had sent a copy to Pendleton. If so, this would tend to confirm the supposition advanced in the notes to the Second Draft that two copies were sent. Wirt indicates that the copy he saw in the State archives was the one forwarded  to Mr. Wythe; <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0365">[365<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-01/TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0365.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> however, he also describes it as an original rough draught, a description which scarcely fits the Wythe copy or Third Draft (Wirt, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Henry</span>, 1, 196). Moreover, if Wythes copy had been used by the Convention as the text from which several parts were taken for incorporation in the Constitution adopted by that body, it seems very likely that some corrections or markings on the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> of the text would have been made to indicate what parts had been selected, how they had been altered, &amp;c.

<p>A word must have been omitted by TJ at this point; elsewhere in the document the comparable phrase is employed: e.g., incapable of holding any public pension , not incapable of any pension. The fact is that at this point in the Second Draft TJ wrote: incapable of being again appointed to the same; then struck out the words being again appointed to; then interlined holding, making the phrase read as he usually wrote it incapable of holding the same. However, the word holding appears also to have had a line drawn through it, though it also bears evidence of the slight smudge that TJ occasionally made in his rough drafts, as if he had run his finger over a freshly drawn line or word to expunge it. At all events, it is certain that incapable of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">holding</span> is what he normally would have written and it is equally certain that holding was interlined though perhaps lined out. The point is worth noting since both the text of the Third Draft and the text of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Enquirer</span> omit the word holding at this point, thus adding to the preponderant evidence that they are identical.</p></div>

<p>The words in italics were struck out, and then TJ interlined the following words at the top of the same page of <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr>: nor shall there be power any where to pardon or to remit fines or punishments.

<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-01-0167-fn-0005-ptr" id="TSJN-01-01-0167-fn-0005">5</a>
<p>The six lines in the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> beginning with the words by an act of the legislature down to and including defined by the legislature, and for are written on a slip of paper pasted on the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> at this point. This represents a curious omission made by TJ in copying, an omission that seems inexplicable except on the ground that the Third Draft (Wythes copy in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ New York Public Library, New York City ]">NN</span>) was copied not from the Second Draft (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>) but from another text. As originally copied in the Third Draft, TJ caused this passage to read in part, without a break in the lines, for breach of which they shall be removeable [end of line] the punishment of which the said legislature shall have previously prescribed certain and determinate pains.  The First Draft includes in rough, interlined form the six lines thus omitted at the end of the line they shall be removeable, but in the Second Draft this passage comprises four and a half lines at the bottom of page 7 and two and a half lines at the top of page 8. It is conceivable that TJ could have accidentally skipped such a passage if it had ended at the bottom of a page or if its beginning and end coincided with the beginning and end of a line. But it is difficult to believe that he could have made this error if he had been copying from a text where the passage began in the middle of the line near the bottom of one page and ended in the middle of the line near the top of another, particularly in a case where the omission involved such a sharp break in the continuity and sense. The evidence in this instance alone is not conclusive, but taken in connection with TJs remarks in 1825, with the statements of Wirt and Leigh as cited in notes to the Second Draft, and other evidences given in these notes, it seems certain that the Third Draft was copied from another fair copy made from the Second Draft. At all events, the omission of this passage conclusively proves that the Third Draft is the copy that George Wythe carried to Virginia, for the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Richmond Enquirer</span> printed the six lines written on the slip of paper, but neglected to include the lines written underneath. This typographical error obviously could have occurred only in the use of the copy now in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ New York Public Library, New York City ]">NN</span>, which, therefore, is the copy transmitted by Wythe.</p></div>
