This is almost conclusive proof that TJs model treaty was completed by the middle of September, for David Hartley returned to London a few days after his communication of 16 Sep. 1784 to the Commissioners, who heard nothing from him after his arrival back in Paris until about the first of November (see Commissioners to Congress, 11 Nov. 1784). It would appear, therefore, that TJ and Hartley had discussed the general form of a treaty before the latter left for London, and it was about this time, no doubt, that TJ also permitted Hartley to make the copy of the map reproduced in Vol. 6: 593.</p></div>
