Notes &amp; draughts rough. Actually, as happened with others of TJs papers at this period, the rough draft of this Bill is also a rough draft of a Bill he prepared in 1779 for the same purpose. The rough draft as it stood in 1776, from which the copy was made, was in 1779 revised again for the Bill introduced 29 May 1779, q.v. (From this 1779 revision of the draft, TJ made a fair copy, though with many alterations; this fair copy <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Paul Leicester Ford, ed., &lt;i&gt;The Writings of Thomas Jefferson&lt;/i&gt;, Letterpress Edition, N.Y., 18921899 ]">Ford,</span> <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ii</span>, 106109, assigns erroneously to 1776.) The draft includes additions and deletions both in its 1776 state and in its 1779 overlay. The distinction between the deletions in the rough draft as it stood in 1776 and those made in 1779 is made possible by the fact that fair copies of each of these states is available for comparison. Only the significant deletions made in the draft in 1776 are indicated in the textual notes below.</p>
<p>This Bill, preceded by similarly unsuccessful attempts to remove the seat of government from Williamsburg in 1761 and 1772 (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Paul Leicester Ford, ed., &lt;i&gt;The Writings of Thomas Jefferson&lt;/i&gt;, Letterpress Edition, N.Y., 18921899 ]">Ford,</span> <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span>, 55), exhibits four aspects of TJs far-reaching legislative program: (1) his endeavor to equalize advantages and opportunities as between the Piedmont and the Tidewater regions; (2) his concern with defense measures; (3) his interest in capitol-planning, foreshadowing his later work on the plans of the national capitol; and (4) the close relationship between his political and his architectural concepts (on which see especially Fiske Kimball, Jefferson and the Public Buildings of Virginia, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ii</span>: Richmond, 17791780, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Huntington Libr.
