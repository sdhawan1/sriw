        <p>The committee consisting of Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Gerry and Mr. Williamson to whom were referred the letters of the Ministers for the U.S. in Europe have agreed to the following report.</p>
        <p>They find that instructions bearing date the 29 of Octr. 1783 were sent to the Ministers plenipotentiary of the U S of America at the court of Versailles empowered to negotiate a peace or to any one or more of them for concerting draughts or propositions for treaties of Amity or commerce with the commercial powers of Europe but that their powers will not extend to the actual signature of any such treaty nor to negotiate with any state or power out of Europe.</p>
        <p>They do not find that any commission consonant with these instructions has been issued to the said Ministers.</p>
        <p>They are of opinion it will be advantageous to these United States to conclude such treaties with Russia, &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Germany</span>&gt; the Court of Vienna, Prussia, Denmark, the Elector of Saxony, Hamburg, Great Britain, Spain, Portugal, Genoa, Tuscany, Rome, Naples, Venice, Sardinia and the Ottoman porte &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">for its possessions in Europe and Asia and Africa</span>&gt;.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0001" id="TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0001-ptr">1</a></p>
        <p>That in the formation of these treaties the following points be carefully stipulated.</p>
        <p>1. That each party shall have a right to carry their own produce, manufactures and merchandize in their own bottoms to the ports <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0394">[394<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-06/TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0394.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> of the other and thence to take the produce and merchandize of the other paying in both cases such duties only as are paid by the most favoured nation, freely where it is freely granted to such nation, or paying the compensation where such nation does the same.</p>
        <p>2. That with the nations holding territorial possessions in America a direct and similar intercourse be admitted between the U.S. and such possessions or if this cannot be obtained then a direct and similar intercourse between the U S and certain free ports within such possessions. That if this neither can be obtained permission be stipulated to bring from such possessions in their own bottoms the produce and merchandize to these states directly and for these states to carry in their own bottoms their produce and merchandize to such possessions directly &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">or lastly a permission to the inhabitants of such possessions to carry their produce and merchandize in their own bottoms to the free ports of other nations, and thence to take back directly the produce and merchandise of these states</span>&gt;.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0002" id="TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0002-ptr">2</a></p>
        <p>3. That these U S &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">being by their constitution consolidated into one fderal republic they&gt;</span> be considered in all such treaties and in every case arising under them as one nation upon the principles of the fderal Constitution.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0003" id="TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0003-ptr">3</a></p>
        <p>4. That it be proposed, though not indispensibly required that if war should hereafter arise between the two contracting parties, the merchants of either country then residing in the other shall be allowed to remain 9 months to collect their debts and settle their affairs and may depart freely carrying off all their effects without molestation or hindrance and all fishermen, all cultivators of the earth and all artizans or manufacturers unarmed and inhabiting unfortified towns villages or places who labour for the common subsistance and benefit of mankind and peaceably following their respective employments shall be allowed to continue the same and shall not be molested by the armed force of the enemy in whose power by the events of war they may happen to fall; but if any thing is necessary to be taken from them for the use of such armed force the same shall be paid for at a reasonable price and all merchants and traders exchanging the products of different places and thereby rendering the necessaries, conveniences and comforts of human life more easy to obtain and more general shall be allowed to pass free and unmolested and neither of the contracting powers shall grant or issue any commission to any private armed vessel, empowering them to take or destroy such trading ships or interrupt such commerce.</p>
        <p>5. And in case either of the contracting parties shall happen to <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0395">[395<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-06/TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0395.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> be engaged in war with any other nation it be farther agreed in order to prevent all the difficulties and misunderstandings that usually arise respecting the merchandize heretofore called contra-band such as arms ammunition and military stores of all kinds that no such articles carrying by the ships or subjects of one of the parties to the enemies of the other shall on any account be deemed contraband so as to induce confiscation and a loss of property to individuals. Nevertheless it shall be lawful to stop such ships and detain them for such length of time as the captor may think necessary to prevent the inconvenience or damage that might ensue from their proceeding on their voyage<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0004" id="TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> paying however a reasonable compensation for the loss such arrest shall occasion to the proprietors. And it shall farther be allowed to use in the service of the captors the whole or any part of the military stores so detained, paying the owners the full value of the same, to be ascertained by the current price at the place of its destination. But if the other contracting party will not consent to discontinue the confiscation of contraband goods then that it be stipulated that if the master of the vessel stopped will deliver out the goods charged to be contra-band he shall be admitted to do it and the vessel shall not in that case be carried into any port but shall be allowed to proceed on her voiage.</p>
        <p>6. That in the same case where either of the contracting parties shall happen to be engaged in war with any other power, all goods not contraband belonging to the subjects of that other power and shipped in the bottoms of the party hereto not engaged in the war shall be entirely free. And that to ascertain what shall constitute the blockade of any place or port, it shall be understood in such predicament, when the assailing power shall have taken such a station as to expose to eminent danger any ship or ships that would attempt to sail in or out of the said ports. And that no vessel of the party who is not engaged in the said war shall be stopped without material and well grounded cause: and in such cases justice shall be done, and an indemnification given without loss of time to the persons aggreived and thus stopped without sufficient cause.</p>
        <p>7. That no rights be stipulated for aliens to hold &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">lands</span>&gt; real &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">estate</span>&gt;<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0005" id="TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> property within these States this being utterly inadmissible under their several laws and policy.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0006" id="TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0006-ptr">6</a> But where on the death of any person holding real estate within the territories of one of the contracting parties such real estate would by their laws descend on a subject or citizen of the other were he not disqualified by alienage, then he shall be allowed a reasonable time &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">to qualify</span> <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0396">[396<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-06/TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0396.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">himself for holding it by changing his country and allegiance</span>&gt; to dispose of the same, and withdraw the proceeds without molestation.</p>
        <p>8. &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">And</span>&gt; That such treaties be &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">limited to the</span>&gt; made for a term &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">of</span>&gt; not exceeding 10 years from the exchange of ratifications.</p>

        <p>That treaties of Amity or<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0010" id="TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0010-ptr">10</a> of Amity and commerce be entered into with Morocco and the &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">other states on the coast of Barbary</span>&gt; and the Regencies of Algiers Tanis and Tripoly to continue for the same term of 10. years or for a term as much longer as can be procured.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0011" id="TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0011-ptr">11</a></p>
        <p>That our Ministers to be commissioned for treating with foreign nations make known to the Emperor of Morocco the great satisfaction which Congress feel from the amicable disposition he has shewn towards these states and his readiness to enter into alliance with them.

I will afford him all the assistance in my power, but it is a very perplexed business. That expedition though for particular reasons under American commissions and colours was carried on at the Kings expence and under his orders. Mr. de Chaumont was the agent appointed by the minister of the marine to make the outfit. He was also chose by all the captains of the squadron as appears by an instrument under their hands, to be their agent, receive, sell and divide prizes &amp;c.

That account however is I believe unsettled and the absence of some of the captains is said to make another difficulty which retards the completion of the business. I never paid nor received any thing relating to that expedition nor had any other concern in it than barely ordering the alliance to join the Squadron at M. de Sartines request. From which extract there is reason to believe the United States of America had no concern in the expedition but that it was carried on wholly under the authority and for the advantage of his Most Christian Majesty; that if this fact should not be so apparent as to give full satisfaction to his Majestys Ministers, they then take such measures as in their discretion shall be thought most conducive to an amicable and equitable adjustment thereof on the best evidence they shall be able to procure.</p>

        <p>That as to the residue of the claims of the Sr. Bayard if founded in truth and Right they lie only against the state of Georgia, to the governor whereof it will be proper for Congress to transmit copies of the papers expressing our confidence that that state will cause to be done in it what justice and the respect due between friendly nations require; and that the Sr. Bayard be referred to them.</p>
        <p>That the friendly services rendered by the Sr. John Baptist Pequet agent for the french nation at Lisbon to great numbers of American sailors carried prisoners into that port during the late war and his sufferings on that account merit the sincere acknowledgments of Congress and that it be referred to the said ministers to deliver him these in honorable terms and to make him such gratification as may indemnify his losses and properly reward his zeal.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0021" id="TSJN-01-06-0331-fn-0021-ptr">21</a></p>

          <p>Thomsons endorsement tells in condensed form, with some gaps, the long legislative history of this important Report which TJ helped prepare and which eventually guided his own conduct as one of the ministers empowered to negotiate treaties of amity and commerce with foreign powers. On 15 Dec. 1783, TJ, Elbridge Gerry, and Hugh Williamson were appointed a committee to report on letters received from Adams, Franklin, Dana, Dumas, and Barclay (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.

The committee delivered in a report on 20 Dec. which was read two days later (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.

Though the Journal does not say so, the Report was debated on 22 Jan. 1784 and recommitted (see the endorsement). At this point, very likely, Charles Thomson made the copy from which the present text and that in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

The authorship of the report is obviously composite; as occasionally happened, Thomson may have put together the various parts of the committee report, copying part and having various members of the committee make their own insertions. At any rate, this appears to be the only version of the report as submitted on 20 Dec. and the extent of TJs contribution can only be estimated by the parts in his hand, as noted below. On 4 Mch. 1784 the committee brought in an amended report, and on 26 Mch. it was debated, when an alteration was made in the third numbered instruction (see note 3). It was again debated on 1 and 2 Apr., and on the latter date was recommitted a second time (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.

According to Thomsons endorsement, this enlarged committee reported two days later, and there was an Order for Thursday 15 [Apr.]. The Journal records no action on either 14 or 15 Apr., but on 7 May 1784 the report was in large part embodied in the instructions to the ministers to negotiate treaties of commerce, and on the same day TJ was elected one of these ministers in the place of John Jay, who was elected secretary for foreign affairs (see <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C.
