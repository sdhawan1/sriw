<p>The said court shall have power to hear and finally determine all suits and controversies whatsoever which shall be brought before them by appeal from the High court of chancery, the General court, or Court of Admiralty, or by writ of error sued out to any decree, judgment, or sentence of either of the said courts: or which shall be adjourned thither from either of the said courts on account of difficulty: but no suit whatsoever shall be originally commenced in the said court of Appeals.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0266-fn-0003" id="TSJN-01-01-0266-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> If the said court shall at any time be equally divided in opinion on any question coming before them by appeal, the decree, judgment or sentence of the court below on such question shall stand confirmed.</p>

<p>The said court of Appeals shall have power to appoint a tipstaff and Cryer, and also a clerk, who shall issue writs of error, upon bond and security given to him, in all cases where the same are hereby allowed to be issued, and shall receive and carefully preserve transcripts of the records upon all such writs, and on Appeals, which shall be transmitted to him by the clerks of the High court of Chancery, the General court and court of Admiralty respectively, entering the names of the parties in a docket in the order he shall receive them, that the suits may be heard in a regular course, without preference to suitors, unless the court for good cause to them shewn, shall order any cause to be heard out of its turn: the said clerk shall also attend the court during their several sittings, and make due entries of their proceedings; and shall certify their affirmance or reversal of the decree judgment or sentence in each case, with the costs of the party prevailing, to the court where the said decree, judgment or sentence was given; which court shall enter up the same, and execution shall issue thereupon as well for the costs expended in the court of appeals, as the other matters recovered by the decree, judgment or sentence.</p>
<p>No appeal shall be allowed to the said court or writ of error issued until a final judgment be given in the court from whence the appeal is, or to which the writ of error is directed.</p>
<p>Previous to the hearing of each cause in the said court, a clear and concise state of the case of each party, with the points intended to be insisted on, shall be drawn up and signed by the partys counsel and printed copies thereof delivered to each of the Judges for their perusal and consideration, the expence whereof shall be taxed in the bill of costs.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0266-fn-0004" id="TSJN-01-01-0266-fn-0004-ptr">4</a></p>

<p>On 30 Oct. 1777 TJ was appointed to a committee to bring in a Bill on this subject, but no further action was taken during this session. On 4 Dec. 1778 the matter was taken up again; on 8 Dec. the Bill was introduced; on 12 Dec. it was passed as amended by the House; and on 15 Dec. 1778 it was agreed to by the Senate (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1777, 1827 edn., p. 7; Oct. 1778, p. 99, 102, 106, 109, 111, 113).</p></div>

The other paper referred to is a draft of an amendment in TJs hand reading: pa. 1. line 4. leave out to consist &amp;c. to the end of the clause &amp; insert which in causes removed after decision from the High court of Chancery shall consist of the Judges of the General court and court of Admiralty; in those from the General court shall consist of the Judges of the High-court of Chancery and court of Admiralty; in those from the court of Admiralty shall consist of the Judges of the High-court of Chancery and General court; and in those adjourned into the said court from either of the others before decision on account of difficulty, shall consist of the judges of all the said courts: who shall have precedence in the said court according to seniority. Three fourths of the members who are to be of the said court in any case shall be sufficient to proceed to business. The judges also of that court from which the cause is removed after decision, shall attend in their places at the hearing thereof and shall deliver the reasons of their judgments. The law as enacted made several modifications in this amendment: causes appealed after decision from Chancery were to be tried by judges of the General Court and three assistant judges chosen by joint ballot of both houses of the legislature; those from the General Court to be tried by judges of the High Court of Chancery and the assistant judges; those from Admiralty and those removed before decision from Chancery and the General Court to be tried by all of the judges, those of Chancery to have first precedence and those of the General Court next (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W.

TJ later struck out this amendment and interlined instead the sentence which follows in the text. In this clause the denial of original jurisdiction to the Court of Appeals was omitted in the Act as adopted (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W.

The other paper is missing, but the Act as adopted includes a final paragraph providing that any person who had entered an appeal from the General Court to the Kings Privy Council (the judiciary committee of which was the court of last resort for appeals from the colonies) and had not had such an appeal affirmed, reversed, or dismissed, could have the appeal transferred to the Court of Appeals (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W. Hening, &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; ]">Hening,</span> IX, 525). This and the two amendments noted above (notes 1 and 3) were in all probability made in 1776, and all three were probably made by TJ. If so, there appear to have been no substantial modifications of the Bill as he wrote it originally.</p></div>
