   <p>The situation presented by this Bill is comparable in many respects to the involved legislative history of the Bills to Divide Fincastle County (q.v., under date of 15 and 16 Oct. 1776). This legislation no doubt arose from the great Inconveniencies presented to the western inhabitants in attending courts and general musters at distant county seats, but there is also no doubt that the matter of creating new counties, and thereby increasing representation of the western region in the General Assembly, brought on internal conflicts of a sectional nature comparable to those reflected on a larger scale upon the question of admission of new states to the Union. TJ led the western party in forcing the Fincastle County division in 1776 and there is evidence that he led the fight over the division of Botetourt and Augusta the succeeding year. The petitions from the western areas included the following: (1) one from inhabitants of parts of Augusta and Botetourt counties asking to be set off into a distinct county; (2) one from Botetourt asking for a division of the county; (3) one from Augusta asking for a division of the county; (4) several from Washington and Montgomery complaining about the boundaries established in the Bills for Dividing Fincastle County; (5) one from Montgomery county praying that a portion of that county be annexed to the northwest corner of Botetourt; (6) one from Augusta praying that a part of that county be annexed to Hampshire; (7) several from Bedford and Henry counties asking for the creation of a new county. To most of these there were counter-petitions. All were referred to the Committee on Propositions and Grievances, of which TJ was a member. It is impossible to reconstruct the history of all this recommended and protested legislation, but it is obvious that the conflict was intense and that the ultimate outcome was often in doubt. For example, on 8 Nov. the Committee succeeded in gaining the postponement of consideration of some of the troublesome petitions to the next session of Assembly; this was, of course, a victory for the eastern party. On 9 Dec. (the whole subject was constantly agitated in the intervening month) the Committee came in with recommendations which far exceeded what the western representatives were able to achieve in the Bill here presented: it recommended that Montgomery be divided and that a new county be formed out of Bedford and Henry. On 10 Dec. the House directed the Committee to prepare bills in accord with these and other recommendations, but the final enactment, of course, did not include those parts of Montgomery, Bedford, and Henry referred to.</p>


   <p>On 16 Dec. Nicholas presented a bill from the Committee for dividing the counties of Augusta and Botetourt. It was read the second time on 17 Dec. and committed to a new committee composed of those whose names are given above; this Bill, apparently, was the one authorized on 10 Dec. On 24 Dec. TJ reported for the committee (he was not its chairman) that the bill should be amended. The amendment in this case was precisely similar in method to that of the Fincastle County Bills: it was to the effect that everything after the initial word Whereas should be struck out and an entire new bill be substituted. The Bill with this amendment immediately passed its second reading and was ordered to be engrossed. On 27 Dec. it was passed by the House and its title changed to An Act for forming several new counties, and reforming the boundaries of two others. TJ carried the Bill to the Senate the same day. The Senate amended the Bill in important particulars and disagreed to others.
