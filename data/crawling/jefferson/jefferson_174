<p>2. Let the legislative be formed of two distinct branches, who, together, shall be a complete legislature. They shall meet once, or oftener, every year, and shall be called the <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">general assembly</span> of <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">virginia.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-01-0169-fn-0001" id="TSJN-01-01-0169-fn-0001-ptr">1</a></span></p>

<p>4. Let the other be called the Upper House of Assembly, and consist of twenty four members; [of whom 12 shall constitute a house to proceed on business] for whose election, let the different counties be divided into twenty four districts, and each county of the respective district, at the time of the election of its delegates for the Lower House, choose twelve deputies, or sub-electors, being freeholders residing therein, [And not be a delegate or representative of the lower house] and having an <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0370">[370<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-01/TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0370.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> estate of inheritance of lands within the district of at least five hundred pounds value.

Let an adequate, but moderate salary, be settled on him, during his continuance in office; and let him, with the advice of a Council of State, exercise the executive powers of government, and of granting reprieves or pardons, except in cases [hereinafter mentioned] where the prosecution shall have been carried on by the Lower House of Assembly, [or where the laws shall otherwise particularly direct, unless the lower house of assembly shall address the Govr. or commr. for such reprieve or pardon.]</p>
<p>[Let each house of the general assembly adjourn themselves respectively.

<p>Two-page printed leaflet (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>), Sabin 100027 (same copy as in Document <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">iv</span>), bearing numerous cancellations and marginalia by William Fleming, together with a <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> on a separate page (also <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>: TJ Papers, 235: 42207) containing four paragraphs, in Flemings hand, to be substituted for those deleted in the Mason Plan by the Committee. These were enclosed in <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-01-02-0169" class="document">Flemings letter to TJ, 22 June 1776</a>. That letter enables us to assign to this revision an exact date, indeed an exact hour: at the time the bell rang for the Convention to meet on 22 June, the status of revision of the Mason Plan by the Committee was as here printed. At this time the Committee had been engaged in discussing and amending the Mason Plan for about a fortnights time. Some additional amendments were subsequently made by the Committee, by the Committee of the Whole, or by the Convention. Nevertheless, this precisely dated revision, made toward the close of the Committees labors and just a day prior to the arrival of George Wythe carrying TJs Third Draft, provides a fortuitous base line for identifying the amendments and additions drawn by the Convention from TJs Draft. The marginalia or interlineations in the leaflet in the handwriting of Fleming are identified here by supplied square brackets; those on the separate page are also enclosed in brackets and noted in footnotes 3, 4, 5, and 7.</p></div>

<p>Opposite paragraphs 1, 2, and 6 Fleming drew a bracket and added the word Agreed. It is almost certain that he did this for paragraph 14 also: the bracket is present, but the writing in the margin is illegible. Paragraph 14, as this indicates, remained substantially unchanged and was adopted by the Convention.</p></div>

<p>The remainder of this paragraph in the printed Plan, struck out by the Committee, was restored in large part by subsequent amendment in Committee of the Whole or in Convention.</p></div>

<p>Paragraph 9 in the Mason Plan (appointment of militia officers) was struck out by the Committee. On the separate sheet Fleming transcribed this paragraph which the Committee substituted for paragraph 9 in the Mason Plan.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-01-0169-fn-0005-ptr" id="TSJN-01-01-0169-fn-0005">5</a>
<p>Following the first sentence in the Mason Plan as printed, a sentence concerning vacancies was at one point inserted in the margin, with the following comment: (Once agreed to by the committee, &amp; afterwards rejected.) The whole paragraph was then struck out <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0373">[373<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-01/TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0373.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> and a new paragraph substituted on the separate sheet. This paragraph was then renumbered 12 by Fleming, and paragraph <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">12</span> in the Mason Plan was renumbered 11.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-01-0169-fn-0006-ptr" id="TSJN-01-01-0169-fn-0006">6</a>
<p>Thus in <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ms</span>. The passage obviously should read: according to the laws of the land. If found guilty, let him, &amp;c.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-01-0169-fn-0007-ptr" id="TSJN-01-01-0169-fn-0007">7</a>
<p>Paragraph 12 of the Mason Plan was at one point amended by the insertion of the words when he is out of office after Let the Governour; then Fleming crossed out the whole and on the separate sheet rewrote and renumbered the paragraph as given here.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-01-0169-fn-0008-ptr" id="TSJN-01-01-0169-fn-0008">8</a>
<p>Only one change in this paragraph was indicated by Fleming, since this section was being discussed by the Committee as <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-01-02-0169" class="document">he was writing to TJ on 22 June</a>. This change was the elimination of the word now before met in Convention, an alteration indicating that some members of the Convention may have shared TJs view that the Convention itself lacked the power to promulgate a substantive law; also, as amended, Masons proviso that the Convention itself should choose the first members of the Senate was dropped. Both the Declaration of Rights and the Virginia Constitution as adopted had the status of ordinances. TJ drafted his constitution as a legislative bill, but he included the proviso that it should be submitted to the electors for approval, whereas the Constitution of Virginia, as adopted by the Convention, remained merely an ordinance until revised in 18291830. This was the cause of much of TJs long-continued opposition to it.</p></div>
