Washingtons information was that an embarkation was taking place destined for <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">this state</span>.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ans</span>. His information was, that it was destined for the Southward as was <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">given out</span> in N. York. Had similar informations from Genl. Washington and Congress been considered as sufficient ground at all times for calling the militia into the feild there would have been a standing army of militia kept up; because there has never been a time since the invasion expected in Dec. 1779, but what we have had those intimations hanging over our heads. The truth is that Genl. Washington always considered it as his duty to convey every rumor of an embarkation: but we (for some time past at least) never thought any thing but actual invasion should induce us to the expence<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0104-fn-0001" id="TSJN-01-06-0104-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> of calling the militia into the feild; except in the case of Dec. 1779 when it was thought proper to do this in order to convince the French of our disposition to protect their ships. Inattention to this necessary ?conomy in the beginning went far towards that ruin of our finances which followed.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">Where were the post riders established last summer?</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ans</span>. They were established at Continental expence to convey speedy information to Congress of the arrival of the French fleet then expected here. When that arrived at Rhode island these expresses were discontinued. They were again established on the invasion of October, and discontinued when that ceased, and again on the first intimation of the invasion of Dec. But it will be asked, why were they not established on Genl. Washingtons letters? Because those letters were no more than we had received upon many former occasions, and would have led to a perpetual establishment of post riders.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Obj</span>. If a proper number of men had been put into motion on Monday for the relief of the lower country and ordered to march to Wmsburg. that they would at least have been in the neighborhood of Richmond on Thursday.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ans</span>. The order could not be till Tuesday because we then received our first certain inform[ation].<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0104-fn-0002" id="TSJN-01-06-0104-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> Half the militia of the counties round about Richmond were then ordered out, and the whole of them on the 4th,<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0104-fn-0003" id="TSJN-01-06-0104-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> and ordered not to wait to come in a body but in detachments as they could assemble. Yet were there not on Friday<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0104-fn-0004" id="TSJN-01-06-0104-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> more than 200 collected, and they were principally of the town of Richmond.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Obj</span>. That we had not <a href="#TSJN-01-06-0104-kw-7701" title="[explained in note]" id="TSJN-01-06-0104-ks-7701" class="keyword">signals</a>.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ans</span>. This tho a favorite plan of some gentlemen and perhaps a practicable one, has hitherto been thought too difficult.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Obj</span>. That we had not look-outs.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ans</span>. There had been no cause to order lookouts more than has been ever existing. This is only in fact asking why we do not always keep lookouts.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Obj</span>. That we had not heavy artillery on travelling carriages.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ans</span>. The gentlemen who acted as members of the B. of W. [Board of War] a twelvemonth can answer this question by giving the character of the artificers whom during that time they could never get to mount the heavy artillery. The same reason prevented their being mounted from May 1780 to December. We have even been unable to get those heavy cannon moved from Cumberland by the whole energy of government. A like difficulty which occurred in the removal of those at S. Quay in their day, will convince them of the possibility of this.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Obj</span>. That there was not a body of militia thrown into Portsmouth, the Great bridge, Suffolk.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ans</span>. In the Summer of 1780, we asked the favor of Genl. Nelson <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0108">[108<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-06/TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0108.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> to call together the County Lieutenants of the lower counties and concert the general measures which should be taken for instant opposition on any invasion until aid could be ordered by the Executive, and these county Lieutenants were ordered to obey his call. He did so. The first moment to wit on Sat. Dec. 31. 8. oclock A.M.<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0104-fn-0005" id="TSJN-01-06-0104-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> of our receiving information of the appearance of a fleet in the bay, we asked the favor of Genl. Nelson to go down, which he did, with full powers to call together the militia of any counties he thought proper, to call on the keepers of any public arms or stores, and to adopt for the instant such measures as exigencies required till we could be better informed.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Qu.</span> <a href="#TSJN-01-06-0104-kw-0001" title="[explained in note]" id="TSJN-01-06-0104-ks-0001" class="keyword">Why were not Genl.

        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ans</span>. What should have been said of them? The enemy did not land nor give them an opportunity of doing what nobody doubts they would have done, that is, somewhat worthy of being minutely recited.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ans</span>. Ask the printer. He got neither from the Executive.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">As to the calling out a few militia and that not till late.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ans</span>. It is denied that they were few or late. 4700 men (the number required by Baron Steuben) were called out the moment an invasion was known to have taken place; that is on Tuesday<a class="ptr" href="#TSJN-01-06-0104-fn-0006" id="TSJN-01-06-0104-fn-0006-ptr">6</a> Jan. 2.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;"><span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ans</span>. How can they be kept without regulars on the large scale on which they were formed? Would it be approved of to harrass the militia with garrisoning them?</p>

From the handwriting and the presence of some interlined corrections it seems probable that this is the original statement drawn up by TJ in the summer or fall of 1781. Filed with it (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>: TJ Papers, 6: 1011 and 1016) are two fair copies of the same paper in TJs hand, one of which is a polygraph copy of the other; these are identical in phrasing with the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> described above, but they differ from it in some spellings and are more carefully punctuated. Both fair copies originally had the same caption, but the caption of that at 6: 1016 contains a later insertion by TJ, enclosed in square brackets in the following transcription: Heads of charges proposed by Mr. George Nicholas to be urged against Mr. Jefferson before the H. of Representatives of Virginia [obtained from Mr. Nicholas in writing &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">by a friend</span>&gt; and communicated by a friend] with the heads of answers proposed <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">to</span> be given by Mr. Jefferson. The date when the fair copies were made has not been ascertained; it could not have been before June 1804, when TJ began regular use of the polygraph, and a plausible conjectural date would be 1805, when TJ prepared a statement on his conduct in 1781 (see notes and documents relating to the British invasions in 1781, Document I, printed above under date of 31 Dec. 1780). Still another text of the charges and answers is embedded in the enclosure in TJs letter to Joseph Delaplaine, 26 July 1816; this text is identical in substance with the others except <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0109">[109<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-06/TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0109.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> for a single inserted phrase which is noted below.</p>
          <p>TJ himself provided the best introductory comments on this paper, and they may be read in the several versions of his vindicatory statement printed above among the notes and documents relating to the British invasions in 1781, 31 Dec. 1780; see Vol. 4: 2612, 264, 268, notes 1516. But these by no means answer all the questions posed by this paper. The principal unanswered question is of course: What relation does the present paper have to the informal series of charges set forth in George Nicholas letter of 31 July, preceding? Nicholas there offered five matters for investigation, only the first and third of which relate to Arnolds invasion in January; but the formal series of charges is eleven in number, and all bear directly on the January invasion. TJ himself says that the formal charges were obtained from Mr. Nicholas in writing and communicated by a friend, but no such paper by Nicholas has been found, the friend who communicated it has not been identified, and the time and circumstances of its being communicated are unknown. It is possible that the formal list of charges here given is the Catalogue of omissions, and other Misconduct mentioned by Cary (letter of 19 June, above); more probably this list was drawn up by the anti-Jeffersonian group after 1 Oct. when the Assembly met again, since the legislature had already adjourned when Nicholas received TJs letter of 28 July. It is unlikely that these charges were prepared by the committee of investigation appointed on 26 Nov. (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-06-02-0130" class="document">John Harvie to TJ, 27 Nov. 1781</a> and enclosure), since TJ obtained his list <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">privately</span> and since that committee had been instructed to convey in writing, to the members which composed the Executive any accusations brought before them. Besides, that committee never brought any charges on the floor of the House. (TJ himself voluntarily read these charges, with his answers, to the House on 12 Dec. 1781.)</p>
          <p>Some of the questions asked and answered in this paper are puzzling in themselves. There had evidently been discussion during TJs term of office about <a id="TSJN-01-06-0104-kw-7701" class="keywordref" title="jump to signals in text" href="#TSJN-01-06-0104-ks-7701">signals</a> (perhaps the use of flaming tar barrels), but that discussion is not on record. The question <a id="TSJN-01-06-0104-kw-0001" class="keywordref" title="jump to why were not genl. Nelson and the brave officers with him particularly mentioned in text" href="#TSJN-01-06-0104-ks-0001">why were not genl. Nelson and the brave officers with him particularly mentioned</a> raises the further questions: mentioned when and where? In his communiqu on the January invasion published in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Virginia Gazette</span> for 13 Jan. (printed above, Vol. 4: 26970), TJ <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">does</span> mention Nelsons action. The question <a id="TSJN-01-06-0104-kw-7702" class="keywordref" title="jump to why publish Arnold's letter without genl. Nelson's answer in text" href="#TSJN-01-06-0104-ks-7702">why publish Arnolds letter without genl. Nelsons answer</a> is partly explicable, though the gaps in the file of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Virginia Gazette</span> at this period make it impossible to state in what issue of that paper Arnolds letter was published. The letter in question (now in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ New-York Historical Society, New York City ]">NHi</span>: Steuben Papers) is from Arnold On Board his Majestys Ship Hope, 2 Jan. 1781, to The Officer commanding the forces on shore, professing surprise at the Hostil appearances of the Inhabitants under Arms on shore and inquiring if they intend to Offer a vain opposition to [] Troops under my command in their landing. According to a letter to Steuben (same location) from James Fairlie, aide-de-camp, Williamsburg, same date, Genl. Nelson sent his compliments back to Mr. Arnold, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Viva Voce</span>, appologising that he had not pen and Ink, that he would oppose him, as long as he has a Man to fight.</p>
