If, among those drawn, there be the name of any member who is a party to the said complaint, or who shall have voted in the election, he shall be set aside; and if any other member whose name is drawn shall shew good cause against his being put on the trial, he shall be excused, and in their stead others shall be drawn to make up the number before specified: it shall be lawful for the petitioners to name one other member present, and the sitting member another, to be of the committee, who may for the like causes be set aside or excused, and the party permitted to name another so often as it shall happen, or on their failure to nominate, the number shall be made up by drawing; which being done the door shall be opened, lists of the names drawn shall then be given to the parties, their agents, or counsel, who, with the clerk of the house, shall forthwith withdraw and strike off one alternately (the petitioners first beginning) until the number be reduced to thirteen if the matter be before the House of Delegates, or five if before the Senate; which thirteen or five, as the case shall be, together with the two members named by the parties, shall be a select committee to try the said complaint, and shall forthwith take the following oath to be administered, in presence of the house, by the Speaker.

On this point Mason <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> has the following:</p>

<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0346">[346<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0346.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>

   <p>The Month of March will be preferable to April for the following reasons. The Elections in April preventing the Assemblys sitting in that month, tho the Emergency be ever so great, may produce much Inconvenience, as the active Season of the Year, and the opening the Campaign in time of War, is then approaching; this might be provided against, by holding the Elections, thro out the Country, on the same Day; but there are some considerable objections to such a Regulation, particularly the Danger of Insurrection of the Slaves, or disaffected. By law, the Assembly is always to meet on the first Monday in May, and the Elections, being the respective County Court Days in April, many of them fall so late in the month, as to prevent the Members of distant Counties attending early in the Session, to the great Delay of public Business.</p>


   <p>The People, being wearied with too frequent Elections, seldom meet to chuse the Commissioners of the Tax, who are therefore generally appointed by the County Courts; this, growing into precedent, may encroach upon one of the fundamental, and most important principles of the Constitution. If the Election of Commissioners of the Tax, and all other annual Elections were fixed to the time of chusing the Members of the Assembly, it woud more deeply engage the public Attention, occasion a fuller meeting, and the People woud be in the habitual Exercise of one of their most essential Rights and privileges; but if the Election of the Commissioners of the Tax was changed from March to April, it woud delay and impede the Execution of the Assessment, in many Particulars.</p>

   <p>The Act as adopted reads: one fourth of his portion.</p>


   <p>This severe legislative penalty for refusal to vote can, in all probability, be traced to George Mason. For on this point the Mason <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> has the following: The Members of the late Assemblys have been the nominal, rather than the real Representatives of the people; many of them have been the Choice of a Handful, a Neighbourhood, or a Junto. An ignorant or obscure Man may have considerable Influence within a narrow Circle; but it will seldom extend thro a County; unfortunately Elections are now so little attended to, that a factious, bawling Fellow, who will make a noise four or five miles around him, and prevail upon his party to attend, may carry an Election against a Man of ten times his weight and Influence in the County, and men of modesty and merit are discouraged from offering themselves; this is the true Cause why we have seen our late Assemblies filled with men so unequal to the Office: a Law therefore which woud bring the Body of the People to attend, and vote at their County Elections, woud be of the greatest Importance to the State. It is presumed some such Regulations as the following may effect it.</p>


   <p>Let two or three Justices of the Peace, taking an Oath of Impartiality, superintend the Election, and be empowered to judge of the Qualifications of the Voters, upon the Spot; for as we have now annual Elections, there will seldom or ever be a disputed Election brought before the Assembly. [Ed. note: see the elaborate provisions in this Bill, below, concerning disputed elections and the manner of resolving such disputesprovisions which were struck out when the Bill was enacted into law.]</p>


   <p>Let all the Freeholders, resident within the County, be obliged, under a certain penalty, to attend and vote at their County Election, unless they send such a reasonable Excuse, in writing, for their Absence, as shall be approved by the Judges of the Election; let such Excuses as the Judges have approved be certified, and filed, together with a Copy of the Poll, in the Clerks Office of the County; or let the names of the Absentees, whose Excuses have been admitted, be added at the Foot of the Poll, and certified by the said Judges.</p>


   <p>Let the Sherif, if the said Judges shall see just Cause, adjourn the Election, from Day to Day; and where it shall appear upon closing the Poll, that &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">less than two thirds</span>&gt; a Majority of the Freeholders, resident within the County, have not voted, let such County remain unrepresented until the next annual Election, and the Sherif make his Return accordingly to the General Assembly.</p>


   <p>In Order to ascertain the Number of Freeholders resident within the County, and carry the Law into due Execution</p>

<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0347">[347<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0347.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>

   <p>Let the Assessors annually, with their Assessment, return to the Commissioners of the Tax, an exact List of the Names of all the Freeholders resident within their respective Hundreds and from these returns let the Commissioners make out an alphabetical List of all the Freeholders resident within their County, to be returnd certified under their Hands, to the Clerks Office; a Copy of which List, with a Copy of the last poll, and a List of the Names of the Absentees whose Excuses have been admitted, to be returned, by the Clerk of the County, to the next Court after every General Election, such Court imediatly to appoint two of their Members to examine these Returns, and from them to make out a List of the Delinquents, to be delivered to the Attorney for the Commonwealth, who shoud be directed by the Court to commence Suits against them. As the Countys Representation will be suspended from the Fault of these Delinquents, their Fines shoud be applied to the use of the County, rather than to the use of the Commonwealth.</p>


   <p>That the two Houses of Assembly may have authentic Information of, and proper Command of their own Members, the Sherif, besides the Certificate he delivers to each Member, shoud make regular Returns to the Assembly.</p>
