The more important alterations made by TJ are indicated in the notes below.</p>
          <p>Although the committee appointed on 13 Dec. 1783 was directed only To prepare a form of ratification of the Definitive Treaty, it is obvious that TJ drew up the present text of a proclamation at the same time and no doubt handed it in on 16 Dec. along with the draft of the text of ratification (see notes to that document). It is a singular fact that TJ was the author both of the document of 1776 that announced the decision to assert independence and of that of 1783 that proclaimed its achievement. Aside from having the same author, both documents also have in common the fact that they were announcements of acts already performed, not the acts themselves. Thus the present document bears the same relation to the resolution of ratification of 14 Jan. 1784 that the Declaration of Independence does to the resolution of independence of 2 July 1776that is, it proclaimed to the world what Congress had already done. In still another sense both documents enjoy a common distinction: they were presented to the world in broadside form by John Dunlap, whose typographical presentation in both instances was remarkably similar, perhaps consciously so.</p>
          <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0464">[464<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-06/TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0464.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span>
          <p>Having ratified the Treaty and authorized the issuance of a proclamation, Congress then took up the third recommendation of the committee that had reported on 16 Dec. 1783that is, that Congress recommend to the states to provide for the restitution of estates of bona fide British subjects that had been confiscated (see report of the committee under date). This final part of the committees report was adopted the same day, 14 Jan. 1784, and it was <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Ordered</span>, that a copy of the proclamation of this date, together with the recommendation, be transmitted to the several states by the secretary (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington C. Ford and others, eds., &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789&lt;/i&gt;, Washington, D.C., 190437, 34 vols. ]">JCC</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xxvi</span>, 31). TJ, knowing what a burden of paper work lay on Charles Thomson, took no chances of delay and so sent under his own frank a copy of the proclamation and of the recommendation to Gov. Harrison on 17 Jan. (see both letters of that date).</p>
          <p>Thereupon, having dispatched this important business, Congress resolved on the following Wednesday to celebrate the final ratification by means of another public entertainment; Read, Howell, and Williamson were appointed a committee to see that this was done (same, p. 31; Committee Book, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span>: <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>, No. 186). Pennsylvania had already taken the lead in preparing for a celebration. The <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penna. Journal</span> for 31 Dec. 1783 announced: We are well informed that the public demonstrations of joy, by authority of the state, on the definitive treaty, will be exhibited in this city, about the 20th of January.  It is expected that this exhibition will be the most magnificent that has ever been made in America. It will consist of a triumphal arch, 50 feet wide and 40 feet high, exactly in the stile of the triumphal arches among the Romans. It is to be built in Market street, between Sixth and Seventh streets. The appearance of this kind of building is extremely noble; but that now to be erected will be rendered uncommonly grand and beautiful, by its being illuminated. It will also be enriched with a number of emblems and inscriptions suitable to the occasion, disposed in the frize, pannels, ballustrade, and pedestals.  The ingenious Capt. Peale is now preparing the paintings; and those figures that are finished have afforded the highest satisfaction to all persons who have seen them. Among them is a striking likeness of our justly beloved Commander in Chief. As the illuminations will continue for many hours, the spectators will have an opportunity of examining the whole work at leisure. From the ballustrade will be thrown up a constant succession of fine fire works. Unfortunately, the great crowds of spectators who assembled on Thursday, 22 Jan. 1784, to witness the lighting of the triumphal arch did not have an opportunity to examine the work at leisure, but they did get an even more spectacular exhibit than had been promised. The <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Penna. Journal</span> announced on 24 Jan. 1784 that by some unlucky accident, the paintings took fire, and were almost instantly consumed; this set fire to a great number of rockets which were on the stage, when a sergeant Stewart, of the artillery, was killed, by one of the rockets entering his head, and four or five persons were hurt. This disaster did not stop the indefatigable artist; Peale at once began repainting the pictures at his own expense, but sympathetic Philadelphians took up a public purse as a testimonial of their regard for his particular merit on this occasion. By mid-March the work was almost complete again and this time it was announced that there is to be no display of rockets or other fire-works (same, 28 Jan. and 13 Mch. 1784).</p>
          <p>In Virginia the General Assembly had been even more forehanded, if less spectacular, by giving a ball to celebrate the arrival of the Definitive Treaty and when the ratification arrived, the Council advised Gov. Harrison to take measures for having it proclaimed with the usual solemnity (same, 31 Dec. 1783, under dateline of Richmond, 20 Dec.; 3 Feb. 1784, <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> Va. Council Jour., <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Virginia, Richmond ]">Vi</span>). But Harrison had already acted by directing the sheriff of Henrico to proclaim the Treaty with all the solemnity in your power on Thursday next, at the courthouse, in the market place, and the capitol. I shall give orders to the officer commanding here to fire an American salute after each proclamation of which you will please to give him notice by signal (Harrison to Prosser, 2 Feb. 1784, Executive Letter Book, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Virginia, Richmond ]">Vi</span>).</p></div>
