<p>On 25 Nov. 1776 TJ presented a Bill for a General Court according to a direction of the House of 1 Nov. That direction had been for the establishment of a General Court. It is to be noted, however, that, as introduced, the Bill was A Bill for establishing a General Court <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">and Courts of Assize.</span> On 2729 Nov. the Bill was discussed in committee of the whole; on 5 Dec. it was amended and ordered to be engrossed and read the third time.

On 30 Oct. 1777 this direction was again given to a committee of which TJ was head.

<p>And for prevention of delay by arresting Judgments and vexatious Appeals, the several Acts of the British Parliament commonly called the Statutes of Jeofails and amendments shall be and are hereby adopted in this Commonwealth. </p>

This draft reads as follows: &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">And forasmuch as it will happen that many counties of this commonwealth will be so remote from the General court in term time and from the judges thereof in vacation that the inhabitants may be long deprived of their liberty and sometimes be altogether removed before they shall be able to apply for and obtain a writ of Habeas corpus from the said court or any of its judges: be it therefore enacted that</span>&gt; the said General court shall from time to time assign in every county some one of the most able learned and fit of the justices of the said county who (no judge of the said court being in the said county at the time) shall receive applications for &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">writs of Habeas corpus from any persons restrained of their liberty as aforesaid and thereupon to order in the cases before directed, which shall</span>&gt; issue and direct to any person within his county writs of Habeas corpus in the same manner as the court or one of the judges thereof may do returnable before the said General court in term time or any judge thereof in vacation, on which writs the same proceedings shall lie as if they had been issued by the said court or a judge thereof. It is possible that TJ drafted this as a separate bill; but the deletion of the preamble in the <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> makes it more plausible to assume that he had intended it as an addition to the General Court Bill.</p></div>
