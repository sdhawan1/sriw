(2) The second copy of the broadside bears the same deletions, interlineations, and marginal additions as the first (and are in TJs hand), but the deletions are made by carefully drawn double rules and the handwriting is precise and regular.

The amendment as recorded in the margin of JB differs slightly: and to all the acts and ordinances of Congress made conformable thereto. This difference supports the conjecture that TJ entered the notations on JB during Congress debates and that in this as in another instance (note 16) copied an earlier form of an amendment and not the words as finally approved by Congress, despite his statement at the bottom of JB: 23 Apr. 1784 Passed in Congress.

In the margin of JB the word soil is interlined in substitution for the deleted words said lands; this corresponds to the change made in OB. But in JB the word assembled is struck out after the first use of Congress and in the revised amendment in OB the word does not appear. It does appear, however, in HB and also in the text as finally adopted (Document v). This difference again supports the view that TJ entered amendments on JB during debates in Congress.</p></div>

This amendment was inserted in margin of JB after the amendment described in note 23 had been adopted, as is proved both by its position on the page in OB and by the exceedingly crowded lines in JB, obviously squeezed in between passages already existing above and below. As originally proposed by Gerry and seconded by TJ, this amendment read: That the lands and improvements thereon of non-resident proprietors, &amp;c. Howell moved to delete the words and improvements thereon; TJ voted against this amendment to the amendment, but only six states could be mustered against it, so the question was lost and the words deleted.

The motion to delete was made on 19 Apr. 1784 by Spaight of North Carolina and seconded by Read of South Carolina. Every delegate including and north of Pennsylvania voted for TJs clause excluding slavery; Jefferson and Williamson were the only delegates southward of that state to vote with them. The lack of the vote of a single delegate determined the outcome; Beatty of New Jersey was ill (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-07-02-0129" class="document">TJ to Madison, 25 Apr. 1784</a>). Sixteen delegates voted to retain the clause, whereas only seven voted to delete it; but the former represented only six states and the latter three. Thus a minority of states and of delegates votes determined the issue, for on the question as to whether the words moved to be struck out should stand, the required seven states could not be mustered, the question was lost, and the words were deleted (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789&lt;/i&gt;, ed.

Randall, Charles Sumner, and others concerning this and other matters (photocopies are in TJ Editorial Files). The reply of Sumner fairly sums up the long-drawn-out argument precipitated by Webster in the Webster-Hayne Debate as to whether Nathan Dane or TJ originated the proviso for the exclusion of slavery in the western territories: To Jefferson belongs the honor of the first effort to prohibit slavery in the territories, to Dane belongs the honor of finally embodying this prohibition in the Ordinance drawn by his hand in 1787 (Sumner to Coles, 23 Aug. 1852, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia ]">PHi</span>).</p></div>

            <p>Another typographical error occurred in the broadside text with the printing of this word as adopt. It was corrected in OB and JB, but TJ failed to make the correction in HB.</p></div>

            <p>At this point in OB there is the symbol #, and in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>: No. 30, p. 57, there is a fragment with a corresponding symbol and the text in TJs hand of an amendment described below. On 23 Apr. Gerry moved the following amendment: That such measures as may from time to time be necessary not inconsistent with the principles of the confederation are reserved for and shall be taken by Congress to preserve peace and good order among the settlers in any of the said new States, previous to their assuming a temporary government as aforesaid (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789&lt;/i&gt;, ed. W. C. Ford and others, Washington, 19041937 ]">JCC</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xxvi</span>, 274; <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> in hand of Gerry in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>: No. 36, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">iv</span>, 563). Read, seconded by Spaight, then moved to postpone consideration of Gerrys motion in order to take up the following amendment that he had unsuccessfully moved two days earlier: That until such time as the settlers aforesaid, shall have adopted the constitution and laws of some one of the original states as aforesaid, for a temporary government, the said settlers shall be ruled by magistrates to be appointed by the United States in Congress assembled, and under such laws and regulations as the United States in Congress assembled, shall direct (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 17741789&lt;/i&gt;, ed. W. C. Ford and others, Washington, 19041937 ]">JCC</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">xxvi</span>, 259, 2745; TJ had voted for the amendment on 21 Apr. possibly because he knew it would be defeated). But only Pennsylvania and Maryland voted for this postponement (TJ opposed it) and Reads motion was lost. At this point, though the Journals credit Gerry with the amendment as ultimately adopted, TJ came forward with a substitute motion on the fragment referred to above (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Papers of the Continental Congress ]">PCC</span>: No. 30, p. 57); that this motion was written by TJ in Congress is proved by the fact that on its recto are various tally marks by Thomson which were clearly on the paper before TJ used it to compose his substitute motion; on its verso <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0613">[613<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-06/TSJN-01-06-02-pb-0613.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> is the tabulation of a balloting in Thomsons hand). As originally phrased this motion by TJ read: That measures not inconsistent with the principles of the Confederation and necessary for the preservation of peace and good order among the settlers in any of the said new states until they shall assume a temporary government in the manner as aforesaid, may be taken by Congress from time to time. The latter part of this was altered (evidently in Congress, since the changes are in Thomsons hand) to read: a temporary government as aforesaid, may from time to time be taken by the US in C assembled. As thus altered, this substitute amendment was finally adopted (as noted by TJ on HB). However, the marginal insertion on JB begins: That &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">such</span>&gt; measures &lt;<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">as may from time to time be necessary</span>&gt; not inconsistent with the principles of the Confederation and necessary for the preservation of peace and good order, &amp;c.; the deleted words correspond exactly with those in Gerrys motion as originally introduced. This suggests that TJ may have drafted his substitute motion on JB and then copied it off on the slip of paper furnished by Thomson. But at any rate, though the Journals give Gerry credit for the amendment, the final wording was TJs.</p>
            <p>The real issue, here, of course, was between the large measure of local control in the territories advocated by TJ and the augmentation of control by Congress advocated in Reads amendment, for which all of the Pennsylvania and Maryland delegates votedstates in which the leaders of the large western land companies were centered and whose policies prevailed in the North-west Ordinance of 1787 that radically reversed the principles laid down by TJ in 1784.</p></div>

            <p>At this point a caret is inserted in OB and in the margin the following is written: from and after the Sale of any part of the Territory of such state pursuant to this Resolve. Corresponding additions appear in JB and HB.</p></div>

            <p>At the bottom of OB are the words Yeas and Nays Mr Beresford. This represented Beresfords request for a roll call vote on the entire revised report as amended down to 23 Apr. 1784. The result showed that ten states voted in favor of the amended report and only Read of South Carolina joined Beresford in casting their states single vote in opposition.</p></div>
