   <p>This Bill, whose principal aim was just the reverse of the unwarranted optimism expressed in the preamble to the Supply Bill passed at the preceding session (q.v. under 20 May 1778; see also Harrell, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Loyalism in Virginia, p</span>. 66112), was, like its predecessors, subject to considerable debate, especially over the perennial question of a fair and equitable mode of assessment of value. TJ was not in the House when the Bill was ordered to be brought in on 14 Oct. 1778 or when it was introduced on 4 Nov. by Tyler and committed to the committee of the whole. He took his seat on 30 Nov., and on 2 Dec. the Bill was taken up, being debated and amended during the next two weeks. In this debate TJ took part, as the amendments offered by him indicate (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1778, 1827 edn., p. 11, 42, 45, 95, 111, 112). <a id="TSJN-01-02-0092-kw-9901" class="keywordref" title="jump to Ordinary licence in text" href="#TSJN-01-02-0092-ks-9901">Ordinary licence</a>: i.e., a license permitting the operation of an ordinary, or tavern.</p>

   <p>In May 1778 TJ had endeavored to substitute a poll tax for the ad valorem levy on slaves, but his amendment had been defeated (see Bill under date of 20 May 1778). The <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> of Bill as introduced by Tyler on 4 Nov. included the following: And be it further enacted that a Poll Tax of<span class="space" title="space in original source" style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-right:1.5em;"></span>for all Slaves above the age of seven &amp; under the age of sixty years and Mulatto Servants shall be paid by the Owners or proprietors thereof  but this was struck out and the previously adopted <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span> system retained.</p>

   <p>The <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> of Bill as originally introduced provided only the following taxes as compared with the list in the amended Bill and in the Act: (1) an unspecified rate on every 100 valuation on All Manors Messuages Lands and Tenements; (2) a similar rate on horses and mules; (3) an unspecified rate on every wheel on all riding carriages, on every ordinary and every marriage license, and on money. The increase in the amount of levies and the number of objects taxed reflects the rapidly growing disparity between the amounts of paper money issued and the funds raised by taxation for its redemption. The report of the committee of the whole of 13 Dec. 1777 had recommended an even longer list of taxable objects; but the House declined to permit taxation of dogs (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, Oct. 1777, 1827 edn., p. 778).</p>

   <p>The Bill as introduced attempted to bring about both uniformity and fairness in procedures by which property in lands was assessed. The method proposed in that <abbr title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ manuscript (arbitrarily applied to most documents other than letters) ]">MS</abbr> was to divide all Lands to the Eastward of the Allegheny Mountains except Lotts or Tenements in Cities or Towns  in three different classes: (1) Rich Lands; (2) Lands of a middling value; and (3) the meaner or inferior Lands. Lands in each of these categories were in turn to be classified in one of three groupslands of first second and third Quality. In each of these nine subdivisions, the Bill would have provided a stated maximum valuation per acre excluding any extraordinary Buildings or improvements thereon. Lands on the west side of the Allegheney Mountains except Lots in Towns were to be similarly classified and maximum evaluations established, but varying from the eastern evaluations. Although the Bill as amended and the Act as adopted restated the substance of the purpose of this section of the Bill as introducedfor establishing some general Rule for the direction of the Assessorstheir final terms <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0223">[223<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0223.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> did not provide any such uniform policy, but merely directed the commissioners of the tax in each county to form some general modegeneral mode, that is, within the limits of each county.</p>


   <p>The question is one that has vexed legislators long before and since the debates on the Virginia supply bills of 1778, but TJ, as might have been expected, tried to solve the problem by innovation. He introduced, but failed to gain acceptance of, the following amendment for that purpose:</p>


   <p>Whereas many doubts have arisen among the Commissioners and assessors of the tax on the construction of the act of General assembly passed in the year 1777 intituled an act for raising a supply of money for publick exigencies and also on one other act passed in the year 1778. intituled an act to amend an act intituled an act for raising a supply of money for publick exigencies some apprehending that they should value lands at the rates at which they would sell in gold and silver, and not at what they would sell in paper bills of credit of this Commonwealth or of Congress; others that they should value them as they would sell were all or a great part of the lands within the commonwealth, or within a county to be offered to sale at one time, and not at the sum at which they would sell if exposed to sale in moderate quantities as happens in the ordinary course of things; and others that, as the legislature had by the latter act only trebled the tax laid in the former, they intended thereby that no more than three times as much money should be raised, and of course that the valuation of the present year should be the same as it was the last without any regard to the rise in the price of property since that time; all which constructions are contrary to the intention of the said acts: and in consequence of such differences of construction very great inequalities have arisen in the rates at which property of equal value has been assessed in different counties during the present year:</p>


   <p>Be it therefore enacted by the General assembly that forthwith on the receipt of this act the Commissioners of the tax for the several counties and corporations shall call together their respective assessors to meet at their court house at as short a day as may be in the present year, and in the subsequent years during the continuance of this act at such time as by the said first mentioned act is directed; and being there assembled, the said assessors shall take an oath or make affirmation as follows I<span class="space" title="space in original source" style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-right:1.5em;"></span>do swear (or affirm) that I will when called on by the commissioners of the tax for my county, truly, candidly, and without reserve declare the worth of the several kinds of lands within my county or corporation, as they would sell according to my own opinion if exposed to sale for ready money in paper bills of credit of this Commonwealth or of Congress, so help me god. which oath or affirmation may be administered by any one of the Commissioners. The said Commissioners shall then proceed to describe the lands of their county in so many general classes not exceeding six as their different natures or kinds may require, and shall call on each assessor singly to declare under the obligation of his oath or affirmation what he thinks each several kind of the said lands would sell for by the acre if exposed to sale in moderate quantities according to the usual course of things, for ready money in paper bills of credit of this commonwealth or of Congress; which several opinions, together with their own they shall state in writing for each kind of land separately, and shall add together the several sums at which the same kind of land is rated by the different commissioners and assessors, and then divide the aggregate sum by the number of persons whose opinions were stated, and shall take the quotient or result, or such sum nearthereto as to avoid the difficulty of fractions may be approved by a majority of the said commissioners and assessors, as the average price of such kind of land; and so shall proceed to deduce an average price for every other kind into which they shall have classed the lands of their county, as before directed. But lots of land in towns and ferry landings and mines of coal or metal, shall not be included within any of the said general classes, but shall, as well as mills and other extraordinary buildings be valued by the assessors within whose bounds they are as they would sell if exposed to sale for ready money in paper bills of credit of this commonwealth or of Congress. The said assessors shall then instead of the oath or affirmation appointed to be taken by the first mentioned act, take the following oath or affirmation to be administered by any one of the Commissioners I<span class="space" title="space in original source" style="padding-left:1.5em; padding-right:1.5em;"></span>do swear (or affirm) that I will to the best of my skill and judgment, in the several parcels of land within the bounds of my assessment estimate the <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0224">[224<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-02/TSJN-01-02-02-pb-0224.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> quantity of each kind thereof as classed or described by the commissioners of the tax for my county, that I will assess the same at the legal pound rate according to the average value of the same kind of lands settled by the commissioners and assessors of my county: that I will faithfully justly and impartially assess the pound rate imposed by law on all other property liable thereto within my hundred, according to the plain meaning of the several acts of assembly under which I act as they appear to my judgment; that I will spare none for favour or affection and none aggrieve for hatred malice or illwill, but in all things do my duty of an assessor honestly, impartially and to the best of my abilities: so help me god. And if any assessor were not present at the said meeting, the said oath last stated shall be afterwards administered to him by some one of the Commissioners or any Justice of the peace of the county or corporation and before he shall proceed to make his assessments. The said Assessors shall then proceed to the assessment of their hundred; in the course of which if they shall differ in opinion as to the value of any parcel of land or of other property the medium between their two opinions shall be taken as the true value.</p>


   <p>And the same inequalities having arisen in the assessment of slaves in the several counties, and it being supposed that the assessment on this kind of property may be rendered much more equal by way of poll tax so settled as to bear the proportion of one and a half per cent to their average value.</p>


   <p>This was a more ingenious and less artificial plan to obtain uniformity and fairness in evaluations of property than that proposed in the Bill as introduced, but it, too, failed to convince the legislators and the varying interpretations on the part of different county commissioners of the tax no doubt continued.</p>
