The deletion in the title just quoted was made by TJ, who interlined the words concerning officers as a substitution for those struck out. This is perhaps explained by TJs attitude toward dependence upon volunteers (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-02-02-0065" class="document">TJ to R. H. Lee, 5 June 1778</a>).

   <p>On 21 May 1779 TJ was appointed head of a committee to bring in a bill concerning officers, soldiers, sailors and marines; he reported it the same day. These facts show that the Bill was already in the corrected state as described above when the committee was appointed. The Bill was amended by both the House and the Senate and finally agreed to 16 June (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by  session and date of publication) ]">JHD</span>, May 1779, 1827 edn., p. 1617, 257, 45, 50, 51).</p>

   <p>At this point the Act as adopted includes the following proviso: that every of the said officers shall, in any one year, be entitled to receive  the following articles of imported dry goods, to wit: Six yards of cloth, seven quarters of a yard wide, with trimmings for a suit of clothes, stuff for six summer vests and breeches, linen for six shirts, cambrick for ruffles to them, and buttons, six stocks, three pair of silk, and three pair of thread hose, six handkerchiefs, two pair of good shoes, and one hat, and no more. Considering the enormous difficulties being experienced in obtaining essential materials for the conduct of the war (see, for example, notes to Bill No. 89, below), it is fairly certain that the amendment entitling officers to silk stockings and cambric ruffles was not one proposed by TJ.</p>
