<p>Whereas George the Third, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Elector of Hanover, heretofore intrusted with the exercise of the Kingly Office in this Government, hath endeavoured to pervert the same into a detestable and insupportable Tyranny; by putting his negative on laws the most wholesome and necessary for the publick good;</p>
<p>by denying his Governours permission to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation for his assent, and, when so suspended, neglecting to attend to them for many Years; by refusing to pass certain other laws, unless the persons to be benefited by them would relinquish the inestimable right of representation in the legislature; <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0378">[378<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-01/TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0378.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> by dissolving legislative assemblies repeatedly and continually, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions of the rights of the people;</p>

<p>by affecting to render the Military independent of, and superiour to, the civil power;</p>
<p>by combining with others to subject us to a foreign Jurisdiction, giving his assent to their pretended Acts of Legislation;</p>
<p>for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;</p>
<p>for cutting off our Trade with all parts of the World;</p>
<p>for imposing Taxes on us without our Consent;</p>
<p>for depriving us of the Benefits of Trial by Jury;</p>
<p>for transporting us beyond Seas, to be tried for pretended Offences;for suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all Cases whatsoever;</p>
<p>by plundering our Seas, ravaging our Coasts, burning our Towns, and destroying the lives of our People;</p>
<p>by inciting insurrections of our fellow Subjects, with the allurements of forfeiture and confiscation;</p>
<p>by prompting our Negroes to rise in Arms among us, those very negroes whom, by an inhuman use of his negative, he hath refused us permission to exclude by Law;</p>
<p>by endeavouring to bring on the inhabitants of our Frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of Warfare is an undistinguished Destruction of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions of Existance;</p>
<p>by transporting, at this time, a large Army of foreign Mercenaries, to compleat the Works of Death, desolation, and Tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy unworthy the head of a civilized Nation;</p>
<p>by answering our repeated Petitions for Redress with a Repetition of Injuries;</p>
<p>and finally, by abandoning the Helm of Government, and declaring us out of his Allegiance and Protection;</p>

<p>This document is included here not only because it must be regarded as in part a TJ document, but also because it is essential in establishing a significant fact: that TJs contribution to the Virginia Constitution is greater than has been generally supposed. Wythe wrote TJ on 27 July: To those who had the chief hand in forming it the one you put into my hands was shewn. <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Two or three parts of this</span> [italics supplied] were, with little alteration, inserted in that. Despite this reference to the inclusion of two or three parts of TJs Draft, most historians have accepted the view that the Virginia Constitution included only the preamble (though Wirt, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Henry, I</span>, 196 and K. M. Rowland, A Lost Paper of Thomas Jefferson, <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;William and Mary Quarterly&lt;/i&gt; ]">WMQ</span>, 1st ser., I [18921893], 37, incidentally refer to but do not otherwise identify the modifications introduced into the body of the Constitution from TJs Draft). Indeed, TJ himself in 1825 agreed with this view: he asserted that Pendleton had informed him by letter that the members had been so long in debate upon a plan of governmentdisputed inch by inch, and the subject of so much altercation and debatethat they could not, from mere lassitude, have been induced to open the instrument again; but that, being pleased with the Preamble to mine, they adopted it in the House, by way of Amendment to the Report of the Committee; and thus my Preamble became tacked to the work of George Mason (TJ to Augustus B. Woodward, 3 Apr. 1825).</p>
<p>The fact is, however, that the Convention did open the instrument again and for the purpose of doing more than tacking on TJs preamble. When Wythe and Lee arrived in Williamsburg-on Sunday, 23 June, the Committee on the Plan of Government had, presumably, finished its labors (<a href="default.xqy?keys=TSJN-print-01-01-02-0169" class="document">Fleming to TJ, 22 June</a>). On Monday the 24th Archibald Cary for the Committee reported a plan of government for this colony; on Wednesday to Friday, 26 to 28 June, the Convention resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole to discuss this plan; the amendments were agreed to on the last date and the Constitution as amended ordered to be fairly transcribed; thus amended, it was unanimously adopted on the third reading, 29 June (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Conv. Jour</span>., May 1776, 1816 edn., p. 64, 66, 76, 78). From this it seems clear that some parts from TJs Draft were added by the Committee of the Whole; but see Document VII, explanatory note, where it is conjectured that the Committee may have incorporated TJs preamble in the missing Report. Hence by comparing the Committee Revision (Document v) and TJs Third Draft (Document III) with the present document it is possible to identify with more or less certainty the passages from the Third Draft that were incorporated in the Constitution. The results of such a comparison are presented in the notes below. From this it appears that there were four distinct parts of TJs Draft, not two or three, embodied in the Constitution with little alteration (notes 2, 18, 19, and 20); three parts that very probably had direct influence on the revisions made 2628 June (notes 3, 16, and 17); and one part that was copied from TJs Draft during the amending process and later struck out (see note 3 Document VI).</p></div>

<p>The phrase &amp; raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands which appeared in the First and Third Drafts was not adopted by the Virginia Convention, though it was retained by the Continental Congress as a permanent part of the Declaration of Independence. On 15 Aug. 1775 the Virginia Convention directed surveyors to make no surveys under the late instructions to the governor (see petition of George Mason, June 1774); now, faced by pressures from the Transylvania Company and other land companies, it is possible, as St. George L. Sioussat plausibly suggests (private communication to editor, 1 Mch. 1949), that the Convention may have thought it would conceivably be necessary further to alter, if not raise the conditions of new appropriations of lands. Dr. Sioussat first called attention to the omission of this phrase in the Virginia Constitution (The Breakdown of the Royal Management of Lands in the Southern Provinces, 17731775, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Agricultural History</span>, <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">iii</span> [1929], 6798).</p></div>

<p>The TJ preamble ends at this point. Whereas TJs Draft had divested George III of all authority and deposed him for abuse of the kingly office; had abolished an office which all experience hath shewn to be inveterately inimical to the public liberty; and had forever prohibited the reestablishment of the <span class="pb" title="page number in print edition" id="TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0385">[385<a style="padding-left: 0px" onclick="window.open('/img-document-get.xqy?image=TSJN/Pages/TSJN-01-01/TSJN-01-01-02-pb-0385.jpg', 'pageImage', 'scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); return false" onkeypress="this.onclick();" tabindex="0" title="Click to view image of page from print edition"><img src="/img-ML/page-icon.gif" width="18" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="page icon"/></a>]</span> royal authority in Virginia, the more conservative Convention merely dissolved the government formerly exercised under the crown in Virginia. However, it is to be noted that the Mason Plan included no preamble whatever; the one adopted from TJs Draft required the insertion of these transitional sentences, even though their terms are very different from those used by TJ. The remainder of this paragraph may, therefore, be properly regarded as an amendment or revision of this part of TJs Draft.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#TSJN-01-01-0171-fn-0003-ptr" id="TSJN-01-01-0171-fn-0003">3</a>
<p>It is probable, though not conclusively demonstrable, that part of the second half of this paragraph was drawn from TJs Draft. The distinctive provision that <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">no person</span> exercising one power should be capable of appointment to the others does not occur in the Mason Plan or the Committees Revision, but does occur, differently phrased, in TJs Draft. The fact that this amendment was not brought forth in the two weeks prior debate, yet was included after the arrival of the one draft that incorporated such a provision, would seem to indicate the direct influence of TJs Draft. However, the provision that justices of the peace should be allowed to sit in the Assembly is so foreign to the ideas incorporated in TJs Draft that it may have been inserted by way of reaction to his more strict adherence to separation of powers; even judges of the High Court of Chancery and of the General Court, under his constitution, would only have session and deliberative voice, but not suffrage in the Senate.</p></div>

<p>This paragraph was copied from TJs Draft, almost literally, except for the following major differences: (1) the addition of the reservation of free navigation of the Potomac and Pohomoke; and (2) the elimination of the requirement that western territories should be established on the same fundamental laws contained in this instrument, and  be free and independent of this colony and of all the world. This, stated T. P. Abernethy, who does not identify it as TJs contribution to the Constitution, was the first sweeping assertion by Virginia of her right to jurisdiction over all the land remaining within the boundaries fixed by the charter of 1609 (Abernethy, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Western Lands</span>, p. 148, where its effect on the strategy of the Indiana Company and the Articles of Confederation are also indicated).</p></div>

<p>Copied from another part of TJs Draft, though included in the same paragraph with the foregoing. However, TJs Draft provided that (1) no lands should be appropriated until purchased of the Indians and (2) every Indian purchase should have the authority of an act of legislature for each transaction. These two important provisos were not included in the Constitution as adopted. However, though the language is TJs, such a provision probably would have been included in the Constitution anyway. For on 24 June, probably as a result of what Wythe and Richard Henry Lee had learned in Philadelphia of the plans of the Indiana Company as well as for the reasons stated (that is, in response to petitions from inhabitants on the western frontiers), the Convention passed a resolution which declared That no purchases of lands within the Chartered limits of Virginia shall be made, under any pretence whatever, from any Indian tribe or nation, without the approbation of the Virginia legislature (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Proceedings&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;the Convention of Delegates&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in the Colony of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; (cited by session and date of publication) ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Conv.
