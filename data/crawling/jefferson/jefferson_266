In <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Library of Congress ]">DLC</span> (TJ Papers, 2:309) there is an undated petition signed by Captains John Allison and John Lee in behalf of themselves and the other officers of the marine companies and stating that they do with great concern find themselves, in their present situation, of very little use to their country, a circumstance the more distressing as they ardently wish to serve effectually the cause they have engaged in. That the smalness of the vessels, and the manner in which most of them are employd, render their establishment useless at present; and before larger vessels can be ready, the time for which the privates enlisted will be expired. That they find, amongst their men, a general willingness to engage during the war, upon the terms proposed by Congress; and have no doubt, that their companies can speedily be recruited, to the number requisite for a continental Battalion. That the marines are a body of active, robust young fellows, well fitted for the land service, to which they are strongly enclined, whilst at the same time they have withstood all endeavours to engage them in that of the sea. That they have thought it their duty to represent these facts, and with due respect submit to the wisdom of the Assembly, whether such a disposition of them may not be made, as will greatly facilitate the raising the troops required by Congress. On the verso of this petition are two items in TJs hand: (1) calculations of quotas for the various counties of Virginia with the names of some of the officers; (2) the following Resolution: That it be an instruction to the Committee appointed to prepare a bill for raising 6 additional battalions to insert in the same a clause or clauses for regimenting and engaging in the Continental service so many of the marine officers and privates in the service of this commonwealth as are willing, and making the same part of one of the said 6 battalions. This resolution was adopted by the House, as an instruction to the committee, on 25 Oct.

The draft of the Bill from which the present text derives has, after each county, two additional numbers that have been deleted: thus the entry for Warwick reads as follows: 7 Warwick (100) [8] 7, the last two figures having been crossed out, as was done for almost all other counties. The deleted figures are not represented in the present text, and the two documents noted above are not given because they are merely TJs progressive calculations for the various quotas. His procedure was as follows: on the basis of the known or estimated militia rolls of each county (the figures given to the right of the name of the county), TJ arrived at a quota of enlistments for each county (the figures given at the left of the name of the county). However, since the instructions given the committee on 18 Oct. designated the number of officers and men of each battalion, the quotas of men here given are not, of course, in the Act; these quotas were in turn used by the House as the basis for determining the number of captains and subalterns to be chosen by the field officers and captains of militia of each county, and the allotment as thus determined is given in the Act (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William W.

On the recto of the second of the two documents referred to at the beginning of this note, in an unidentified hand, is the following: Heads of the bill for raising six battalions of infantry on continental account. That the six battalions consist of ten companies each, and each company of sixty eight men rank and file with their proper officers to serve during the continuation of the war, unless sooner discharged by Congress. That each of the battalions be commanded by a colonel a lieutenant colonel, a major, ten captains twenty lieutenants ten ensigns and forty serjeants, and each company to be allowed a drummer and a fifer. The nine companies of marines to be included in the six battalions. This meant that each company of non-commissioned officers and men (68 men plus four sergeants, one drummer and one fifer) totalled 74, or 740 in a battalion. The total number of militia tabulated by TJ on the verso of the document just quoted was 47,255; this figure he divided by 3330 (740 multiplied by 4.5), obtaining the quotient 14; thus one-fourteenth of the militia strength of the county was set as the quota for that county, and this in turn was the figure used in calculating the number of officers to be appointed in each county. TJ arrived at the figure 4.5 by deducting the half-battalion on the Ohio and the whole battalion of West Augusta from the total of six.</p></div>
