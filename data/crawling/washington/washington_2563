<p>If you saw my Brother John in Stafford when you were down there at Christmas; if you had any Conversation with my Br. Saml on the Subject I mentioned to you; and if any time was proposed for your meeting at this place, I shoud be glad to know it, &amp; beg you will write me a line by the first Post after this gets to hand informing me of it accordingly; as I want to prepare for my journey but am desirous before hand of knowing whether I am to go alone or in company as it will make some difference in my preparations.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0001-ptr">1</a></p>
<p>As I expect it will now shortly be known, whether the Officers &amp; Soldiers under the Kings Proclamation have any chance to come in for Lands West of the Alligany mountains<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> I shoud be glad to know if any of them which may fall in your way woud sell their rights; and upon what terms; tho. I have little expectations that any of them will sell upon such terms as I woud buy, or any person coud afford to buy, unless they warranted the Land; for if the number of Grants (which are of older date to the Kings Proclamation) shoud take place, as their is but too much reason to apprehend, if they do not by clashing with each other, destroy themselves; I woud hardly give any Officer a button for his Right: for besides a large Tract of Country reserved for the Indian Traders, from Fort Pitt near 150 Miles down the Ohio, &amp; up to the Laurell Hill, there appeard by a List laid before the House of Burgesses by Order of the Govr to be between 6 &amp;
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-08-02-pb-0301">[301]</span>
7,000,000 of Acres actually granted, &amp; Petitioned for; &amp; most of the Grants made in such generall, &amp; indeterminate terms, that if confirmd, no man can lay off a foot of Land &amp; be sure of keeping it, till they are servd.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0003-ptr">3</a></p>
<p>Upon my shewing Mr Thruston (who was formerly a Lieutt, &amp; thereby entitled to 2,000 Acres of Land) a Copy of the Grants, &amp; proceedings of the House of Burgesses thereupon, he immediately sold his right (tho. otherwise very fond of it) to Lund Washington for Ten pounds<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0004-ptr">4</a>Now, coud I purchase 12 or 15,000 Acres upon the same terms, I woud do it, considering of it as a Lottery only; and my Reasons for so doing are theseSuch a quantity of Land as this, added to what I may expect in my own Right, woud form a Tract of so great dignity as to render it worth my while to send out a Person for the discovery of Land, clear if possible of these numerous grants; and to be at some expence and trouble in seating and Saving it; for without this the Land woud soon be forfeited (which I beleive will be the case with half the Officers in this Colony) if they shoud actually obtain the Land. &amp; again, it woud be worth my while thus situated, to buy of some who might under their Grants think I clashd with them.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, as you are situated in a good place for seeing many of the Officers at different times,<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0005" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> I shoud be glad if you woud (in a joking way, rather than in earnest at first) see what value they seem to set upon their Lands, and if you can buy any of the rights of those who continued in the Service till after the Cherokee Expedition, at the rate of about five, Six, or Seven pounds a thousand acres I shall be obligd to you, &amp; will pay the money upon demand. I am of opinion that Chew,<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0006" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0006-ptr">6</a> &amp; some of those who may be in want of a little ready money, would gladly sell; nor is it much to be wondered at if they shoud, for if those large Grants which I have already mentiond shoud take place the purchaser will have sunk so much money to very little purpose; nor is the Officers right under the Proclamation of any consequence to those who either does not resolve to go after the Land himself, or employ others to do it for him; the first I do not suppose many are inclind to, the last is hardly worth the expense for small tracts; &amp; the Officer is as much obliged to find the Land as any other individual; nor is his Title, if he be not entitled to some degree of preference, a jot better than any

other Mans who will go in pursuit of Lands himself, except that he is to enjoy it 10 years free of Quitrents.</p>
<p>If you shoud make any purchases, let it be done in your own name; for reasons I shall give you when we meettake Bonds in large Penalties to convey all their Rights under the Kings Proclamation to you; and they shoud be obligd to suffer their names to be made use of to obtain the Land, as the Kings Proclamation requires a Personal application to the Govr &amp; Council in order to entitle them to the Respective quantities granted. In looking over the List of Grants that were laid before the Ho. of Burgesses I perceivd one for 10,000 Acres to a certain Ambrose Powell (who I beleive lives in Culpeper County) lying above the Mouth of the great Kanhawaythis is comprehended within our Grant of 200,000 Acres, it is also fixed at a place where two or three other Grants are laid &amp; I believe some of them older; but yet, as it lyes in the way of a scheme I have in view; and woud, in some small degree promote my Plan if I had it, I shoud be obligd to you if you woud enquire in a round about way who this Powell is, where he lives, &amp;ca; &amp; tell me who you think the most likely person for me to employ to purchase his right to the Grant<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0007" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0007-ptr">7</a>You need not let your reasons for enquiring after Powell be known, till you have given me what information you can concerning him, least it may give him or others cause to imagine that his grant is more valuable than it really is: In fact, I do not think that it is intrinsically worth a groat (tho. I woud give eight or Ten pounds for it, If I coud not get it for less) inasmuch as it is totally swallowed up in other Grants; but several of this sort may in some measure give me a prior claim to have my share of the 200,000 Acres laid of above the Mouth of the Gt Kanhaway where I am told the land is very fine, it is for this reason therefore I would even give a tittle for Powells.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0008" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0008-ptr">8</a></p>
<p>In the whole of your transactions, either with the Officers, or on this other matter; do not let it be known that I have any concern therein. I have Inclosd you a copy of the Bond I drew from Thruston to Lund Washington, which will serve you for a Precedent in case you shoud make any purchasesI have put your name in the place of Lund Washingtons as I would have the title given to you, &amp; not to me, till matters are riper than they appear to be at present. I shall take care to furnish you

   <p>John Augustine Washington with his wife and one daughter, Samuel Washington, and Lawrence Washington of Chotank, also with a daughter, all arrived at Mount Vernon on 22 Feb. and remained until 1 March. The third brother, Charles Washington, did not get to Mount Vernon until 16 Mar., accompanied by Fielding Lewis, their brother-in-law. The journey that GW is referring to may be that of October 1770 to Pennsylvania and the Ohio country, with only James Craik as a traveling companion. For a possible indication of the Subject of the family meeting, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-08-02-0153" class="document">Edmund Pendleton to GW, 3 July 1769</a>.</p>

   <p>By the terms of the royal proclamation in 1763, the governors of the colonies in America had been instructed to give land to the officers and men who had served in America during the war just ended, but the proclamation also banned the granting of land in the transmontane west. Consequently, the veterans of the French and Indian War still had not received their bounty land. Treaties with Indians in 1768 ceding rights to a large area in the West (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-08-02-0203&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0003#GEWN-02-08-02-0203-fn-0003" class="document">note 3</a>) inspired the general expectation that restrictions on the granting of western lands imposed by the Proclamation of 1763 were at the point of being lifted. Under the terms of the proclamation, GW was entitled to 5,000 acres.</p>

In 1773 GW used the Thruston warrant to claim 2,000 acres on the Great Kanawha within William Crawfords 1771 survey, but it was not until 12 April 1784 that the grant for the land was issued to GW (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-04-01-02-0067&amp;expandNote=GEWN-04-01-02-0067-fn-0006#GEWN-04-01-02-0067-fn-0006" class="document">GW to Thomas Lewis, 1 Feb. 1784, n.6</a>).</p>
