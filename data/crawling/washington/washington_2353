<p>It is difficult for me to tell which was greatest, my Surprise, or concern, at finding by your Letter of the 20th<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0001-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0001-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> that instead of being able with the money I agreed to lye somewhat longer out of, to discharge your Debts, that you wanted to borrow a further Sum of 500 to answer this purpose. I was in hopes, and you gave me the strongest assurances to believe, that when I lent you (&amp; very inconvenient it was for me to do it) the first Sum of 700 you coud therewith, not only discharge all your Creditors, but in two years time sink the principal which was lent to effect that end; how it comes to pass then, that instead of being prepared in twice two years to discharge my claim, you shoud require 500 more to satisfie others, is,<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0001-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0001-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> as I at first said, entirely beyond my comprehension, and leaves but too much cause to apprehend, that if you coud be supplied with the further Sum required, it woud afford but temporary relief; and that at the end of any other prefixd period you woud be as unprepard and as reluctantly then, as now, part with yr effects to discharge this Debt; thinking it equally hard to be forced into compliancefor permit me to say again, if you have not been able in the course of 4 Years to lay up anything towards sinking even the Interest of a Sum which you said woud entirely clear you of all demands, what prospect can you possibly have to expect when 500 more (&amp; probably this woud be insufficient) is added to the other surety of between eight and nine hundd, that you will have it in your power to effect this end, when even the Interest thereof is a pretty little Income, &amp; woud be such a Moth in your Estate as woud inevitably destroy it, be your notions of saving &amp; Industry extended to never so high a degree: Indeed Sir, the only purpose it coud possibly answer woud be to put the evil day of for a moment, in comparison, &amp; then like most things swelld beyond their natural bounds, burst upon you like a torrent &amp; redouble your distresses. Besides, you really deceive yourself greatly in estimating your Effects, as you will unhappily experience; you have viewed them but on one side, considering only what they cost you, not what they will

sell at, which is a delusive way of calculating; for you will find that many things which you perhaps have lavishd large Sums in the purchase of, in order to gratify yr own taste, will neither suit, nor probably please others; so in respect to buildings which are rarely considered in the purchase of Lands, &amp; principally I presume from the same causes, especially upon small bits of Land divested of Wood &amp; Timber.</p>
<p>I wish with all my Heart you may be strengthned by some able and friendly hand in such a manner as to keep your effects together; provided it may turn to your future good in enabling you to Work thr the load of Debt you seem to be entangled in, but that it is intirely out of my power without selling part of my own Estate to contribute further thereto you may easily be convincd of when I tell you, &amp; affirm it that I find it next to impossible to extract any part of the money which is due to me; that I have struggled to the utmost of my power for two years past, unsuccessfully to raise 4 or 500 to lend a very particular friend of mine, who I know must sell part of his Estate without it&amp; that I have not yet dischargd the Sums you Involvd me in the payment of before, having my Bond out to Mr Greens Estate for the 260 you borrowd of him &amp; cannot raise money to discharge it, altho I have used my true endeavours for that purpose<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0001-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0001-fn-0003-ptr">3</a>add to these, some Engagements of my own which there is a necessity of complying with, or doing Acts of Injustice. How absurd and Idle woud it be then, under these Circumstances, to enter myself security for the payment of yr Debts, unless I foresaw some prospect of raising the moneytrue it is some of yr Creditors might agree to wait, others tis presumeable woud not, and certain it is pay day must come to all; what then is to be done? to tell a Man who had been disappointed from time to time, and at last had waited in confidence of Receiving his money from me, that I was unprovided with the means of satisfying his demand, woud be gauling to meunjust to him&amp; what I can by no means think of practising. the only favour therefore that is in my power to shew you, is to be easy &amp; forbearing in my own demands, which I shall endeavour to do as long as I can with any sort of convenience to myself, notwithstanding I am in want of the money; &amp; to point out any Person who cd lend so much money even if they liked the Security, I am equally at a loss to do: but few there are I beleive, who woud choose to risque their money (unless influenced by
