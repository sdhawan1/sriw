<p>With regard to Shiping Your Corn or Flour to New EnglandIf I coud have got a Vessle, I shoud have Shipd it, before this either there, or to some other place for I see no prospect of sellg it hereI was upon a Bargain with a new england man to furnish him with 4000 Bushels of Corn at 8/ pr Barrelbut while he was deliberateg whether it was not rather too high a price to give, a Maryland gentleman or two offerd to supply him for 8/ maryland Currency.</p>
<p>Mr Hooe Advises me to send it, to one of the French Islands in the West Indias, he thinks the Risque in going there not so great as in going to the above, the prices equal if not much better<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0286-fn-0005" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0286-fn-0005-ptr">5</a>however there is one argument in favour of new england, which is that after you had run the risque of the Cargo outwards, there woud be no danger of the remittance as it might be paid to you, whereas the remittance from the West Indias woud run as great a Risque in comeing safe to hand as the Cargo did in going there. there is no Vessle to be had for either port.</p>
<p>I shall plant the Locust Trees as you direct the distance between the Kitchen and Store is not sufficient for 4 trees two well grown Locusts will be fully enoughin mentiong putg a tree between the Store and smoke House, and that and the Hen House, and so on, you are not so particular as I coud wish for I am at a loss whether to put them between the Houses, in the Center of the Gable Ends, or to range them with the sidesI shall do the latter, on the side next the garden, if it is wrong they may be moved hereafter.</p>

   <p>Nicholas Cresswell (17501804), an English traveler who was in Leesburg, the county seat of Loudoun County, on 12 Feb. 1776, wrote in his diary entry for that date: Court day. Great confusion, no business done. The populace deters the Magistrates and they in turn are courting the rebels favour. Enlisting men for the Rebel Army upon credit. Their paper money is not yet arrived from the Mine (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Lincoln MacVeagh, ed. &lt;i&gt;The Journal of Nicholas Cresswell, 17741777&lt;/i&gt;.

   <p>Lund Washington reported in his letter of 22 Feb. that Col. Hugh Mercers 3d Virginia Regiment was expected at Alexandria in a few days. On 5 Mar. 1776 the Virginia committee of safety ordered Mercer and his regiment to Dumfries, a town on Quantico Creek in lower Prince William County, about twenty-five miles down the Potomac from Alexandria. Mercers orders were again changed on 2 April by Gen. Charles Lee who directed him to march his men to Williamsburg. For the building of armed vessels at Alexandria, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-04-02-0017" class="document">George Mason to GW, 2 April 1776</a>.</p>

   <p>Until 1780 Charles Washington lived in Fredericksburg about twenty-five miles from Dumfries where Mercers regiment was to be stationed. GW had offered during the previous fall to loan his marquee to his brother Samuel (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0067" class="document">GW to Samuel Washington, 30 Sept. 1775</a>). Although GW then indicated that he might soon want the marquee for his headquarters, he apparently
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-03-03-02-pb-0398">[398]</span>
did not call for it because during the spring of 1776 he acquired three tents including two marquees from Philadelphia (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-03-02-0062&amp;expandNote=GEWN-03-03-02-0062-fn-0003#GEWN-03-03-02-0062-fn-0003" class="document">GW to Joseph Reed, 14 Jan. 1776, and references in note 3</a>). George Mason, Jr., was either Col. George Masons eldest son, George Mason (17531796), who lived near his father on Masons Neck at Lexington, or the colonels first cousin George Mason who lived on Pohick Creek.</p>
