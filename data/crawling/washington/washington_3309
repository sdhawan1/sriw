   <p>On 1 Dec. 1771 (12 Dec. according to Adams account in the Custis Account Book) GW as guardian of Martha Parke Custis lent 1,000 Virginia currency to Robert Adam, who the year before had entered a partnership with two merchants in Alexandria. At Martha Parke Custiss death in 1773, GW as the husband of her mother received as a part of his share of the childs estate the debt of 1,000 owed by Adam. In order to secure the debt, GW had Adam on 19 Dec. 1774 execute a deed mortgaging to him two tracts of land in Loudoun County, one of 400 acres 1 miles from Leesburg, the other of 500 acres 4 miles from the town (Loudoun County Deed Book L, 3539, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Loudoun County Courthouse, Leesburg, Va.
