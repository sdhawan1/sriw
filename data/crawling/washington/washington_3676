<p>Your Letter by Captn Prince came to my hands last Night<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0001" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0001-ptr">1</a>I was glad to learn by it that all are well. the acct given of the behaviour of the Scotchmen at Port Tobacco &amp; Piscataway surprizd &amp; vexed meWhy did they Imbark in the cause? what do they say for themselves? What does other say of them? are they admitted into Company? or kicked out of it? what does their Countrymen urge in justification of them? they are fertile in invention, and will offer excuses where excuses can be made.
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-03-01-02-pb-0335">[335]</span>
I cannot say but I am curious to learn the reasons why men, who had subscribed, &amp; bound themselves to each other, &amp; their Country, to stand forth in defence of it, should lay down their arms the first moment they were called upon.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0002" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0002-ptr">2</a></p>
<p>Although I never hear of the Mill under the direction of Simpson, without a degree of warmth &amp; vexation at his extreame stupidity, yet, if you can spare money from other Purposes, I could wish to have it sent to him, that it may, if possible, be set agoing before the Works get ruined &amp; spoilt, &amp; my whole money perhaps totally lost.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0003" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> If I am really to loose Barrauds debt to me, it will be a pretty severe stroke upon the back of Adams,<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0004" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> &amp; the expence I am led into by that confounded fellow Simpson, and necessarily so in Seating my Lands under the Management of Cleveland.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0005" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0005-ptr">5</a></p>
<p>Spinning should go forward with all possible dispatch, as we shall have nothing else to depend upon if these disputes continue another year<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0006" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0006-ptr">6</a>I can hardly think that Lord Dunmore can act so low, &amp; unmanly a part, as to think of siezing Mrs Washington by way of revenge upon me; howevr as I suppose she is, before this time gone over to Mr Calverts, &amp; will soon after retug, go down to New Kent, she will be out of his reach for 2 or 3 Months to come, in which time matters may, &amp; probably will, take such a turn as to render her removal either absolutely necessary, or quite uselessI am nevertheless exceedingly thankful to the Gentlemen of Alexandria for their friendly attention to this point &amp; desire you will if there is any sort of reason to suspect a thing of this kind provide a Kitchen for her in Alexandria, or some other place of safety elsewhere for her and my Papers.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0007" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0007-ptr">7</a></p>
<p>The People of this Government have obtained a Character which they by no means deservedtheir Officers generally speaking are the most indifferent kind of People I ever saw. I have already broke one Colo. and five Captains for Cowardice, &amp; for drawing more Pay &amp; Provisions than they had Men in their Companies. there is two more Colos. now under arrest, &amp; to be tried for the same Offences<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0008" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0008-ptr">8</a>in short they are by no means such Troops, in any respect, as you are led to believe of them from the Accts which are published, but I need not make myself Enemies among them, by this declaration, although it is consistent with truth. I daresay the Men would fight very well

(if properly Officered) although they are an exceeding dirty &amp; nasty people. had they been properly conducted at Bunkers Hill (on the 17th of June) or those that were there properly supported, the Regulars would have met with a shameful defeat; &amp; a much more considerable loss than they did, which is now known to be exactly 1057 Killed &amp; Wounded<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0009" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0009-ptr">9</a>it was for their behaviour on that occasion that the above Officers were broke, for I never spared one that was accused of Cowardice but brot em to immediate Tryal.</p>
<p>Our Lines of Defence are now compleated, as near so at least as can bewe now wish them to come out, as soon as they please, but they (that is the Enemy) discover no Inclination to quit their own Works of Defence; &amp; as it is almost impossible for us to get to them, we do nothing but watch each others motions all day at the distance of about a Mile; every now and then picking of a stragler when we can catch them without their Intrenchments; in return, they often Attempt to Cannonade our Lines to no other purpose than the waste of a considerable quantity of Powder to themselves which we should be very glad to get.</p>
<p>What does Doctr Craik say to the behaviour of his Countrymen, &amp; Townspeople? remember me kindly to him, &amp; tell him that I should be very glad to see him here if there was any thing worth his acceptance; but the Massachusets People suffer nothing to go by them that they can lay hands upon.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0010" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0010-ptr">10</a></p>
<p>I wish the money could be had from Hill, &amp; the Bills of Exchange (except Colo. Fairfaxs, which ought to be sent to him immediately) turnd into Cash; you might then, I should think, be able to furnish Simpson with about 300;<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0011" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0011-ptr">11</a> but you are to recollect that I have got Cleveland &amp; the hired People with him to pay also. I would not have you buy a single bushel of Wheat till you can see with some kind of certainty what Market the Flour is to go to&amp; if you cannot find sufficient Imployment in repairing the Mill works, &amp; other things of this kind for Mr Roberts and Thomas Alferd, they must be closely Imployed in making Cask, or working at the Carpenters or other business otherwise they must be discharged, for it is not reasonable, as all Mill business will probably be at an end for a while, that I am to pay them 100 a year to be Idle. I should think Roberts himself must see, &amp; be sensible of the reasonableness of this request,
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-03-01-02-pb-0337">[337]</span>
as I believe few Millers will find Imploymt if our Ports are shut up, &amp; the Wheat kept in the Straw, or otherwise for greater Security.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0012" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0012-ptr">12</a></p>
<p>I will write to Mr Milnor to forward you a good Country Boulting Cloth for Simpson which endeavour to have contrived to him by the first safe conveyance.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0013" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0013-ptr">13</a> I wish you would quicken Lanphire &amp; Sears about the Dining Room Chimney Piece (to be executed as mentioned in one of my last Letters) as I could wish to have that end of the House compleatly finished before I return.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0014" id="GEWN-03-01-02-0234-fn-0014-ptr">14</a> I wish you had done the end of the New Kitchen next the Garden as also the old Kitchen with rusticated Boards; however, as it is not, I would have the Corners done so in the manner of our New Church.

   <p>Lund Washingtons letter has not been found. Although there was a Capt. Asa Prince in Col. John Mansfields Massachusetts regiment on Winter Hill, the bearer was probably Capt. Thomas Price of Frederick, Maryland. He left Frederick with his rifle company on 18 July and arrived at Cambridge about 11 Aug., after a brief stopover in Philadelphia, where he may have been given Lunds letter.

   <p>The town of Piscataway on Piscataway Creek in Prince Georges County, Md., is a few miles east of Mount Vernon. Port Tobacco lies in Charles County, Md., about sixteen miles south of Piscataway. Dr. Robert Honyman, who visited Port Tobacco on 2 Mar. 1775, wrote in his journal that he went out into a field by the town &amp; saw a Company of about 60 Gentlemen learning the military Exercise (Philip S. Padelford, ed., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Colonial Panorama, 1775: Dr. Robert Honymans Journal for March and April</span> [San Marino, Calif., 1939], 2).</p>

   <p>As manager of GWs property at Washingtons Bottom, Pa., Gilbert Simpson, Jr., was supervising the construction of a large gristmill near the
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-03-01-02-pb-0338">[338]</span>
  mouth of Washingtons Run, a tributary of the Youghiogheny River. Begun in early 1774, the work on the mill had been slow and costly, which GW attributed to Simpsons mismanagement (Gilbert Simpson to GW, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-09-02-0239" class="document">31 Aug.</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-09-02-0266" class="document">1 Oct. 1773</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-10-02-0035" class="document">4 May</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-10-02-0095" class="document">20 Aug.</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-10-02-0106" class="document">24 Sept.</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-10-02-0121" class="document">9 Nov. 1774</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-10-02-0187" class="document">6 Feb.</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-10-02-0248" class="document">3 April 1775</a>). The mill ran for the first time in the spring of 1776, but it produced no profits during the war years to reimburse GW for the 1,000 to 1,200 that he spent in building it. When GW visited western Pennsylvania in September 1784, he found the mill on Washingtons Run in a state of total disrepair (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig, eds. &lt;i&gt;The Diaries of George Washington&lt;/i&gt;. 6 vols.

   <p>GW never received the 1,748 17s. in Virginia currency that the Norfolk firm of Balfour &amp; Barraud owed him for flour and ship biscuit (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Manuscript Ledger Book 2, 1772-93, in George Washington Papers, Library of Congress. ]">Ledger B</span>, 136). The contract that GW signed with an agent of the company at Mount Vernon on 4 Jan. 1775 called for GW to deliver the flour and bread by 1 March and for the company to pay him half of his money at the April meeting of the general court in Williamsburg and the balance at the courts October meeting. The companys failure to meet its April obligation may have been due to James Balfours death early that month at his home near Hampton. GWs absence from Virginia and the wartime disruption of the economy in tidewater Virginia effectively prevented his bringing the firms surviving partner, Daniel Barraud, to account (Fielding Lewis to GW, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0342" class="document">14 Nov. 1775</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-03-02-0307" class="document">6 Mar. 1776</a>; <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-04-04-02-0070" class="document">GW to Neil Jamieson, 20 May 1786</a>). GW did receive some compensation, however, for the debt of 106 6s. 6d. in Virginia currency that Daniel Jenifer Adams (b.1751) of Charles County, Md., still owed him for flour that Adams had sold for GW in the West Indies during 1772.

   <p>William Roberts was the miller at Mount Vernon from 1770 to 1785. During the fall of 1775, Roberts and his apprentice, Thomas Alfred (Alford), were employed for several weeks in repairing the milldams and millrace, which were twice damaged by freshets (Lund Washington to GW, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0105" class="document">5</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0164" class="document">15</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0193" class="document">22 Oct. 1775</a>), but Lund Washington found little else for them to do because barrels that were made in advance usually had to be rebuilt before they could be used (Lund Washington to GW, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0328" class="document">12 Nov. 1775</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-03-02-0134" class="document">25 Jan. 1776</a>).

   <p>William Milnor was a Quaker merchant in Philadelphia who rented a fishery at Mount Vernon during 1774. A strong supporter of the American cause, Milnor assisted GW during the winter and spring of 1775 in obtaining various military accoutrements both for his own use and for the Fairfax and Prince William independent companies. Milnor also supplied GW with household and plantation goods from Philadelphia, and in the fall of 1773 he sent GW two yards of good bolting cloth, presumably for the Mount Vernon mill (<a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-09-02-0277" class="document">Milnor to GW, 19 Oct. 1773</a>; <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-09-02-0309" class="document">GW to Milnor, 16 Dec. 1773</a>). Although no letter has been found from GW to Milnor requesting a bolting cloth for the mill at Washingtons Bottom, Milnor did receive the order, and sometime before 15 Oct. he wrote to Lund Washington assuring him that the bolting cloth would be sent (<a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0164" class="document">Lund Washington to GW, 15 Oct. 1775</a>).

mansion house on both ends by adding a downstairs library and an upstairs master bedroom on the south and a two-story banquet room on the north. Work on the southern addition was begun in April 1774 by Going Lanphier (17271813), a house carpenter who had done smaller jobs at Mount Vernon in 1759 and 1765. This addition was finished by the end of 1775, and in 1776 Lanphier began raising the northern addition. The interior of the second addition was still incomplete when GW returned to Mount Vernon at the end of 1783. The work on the chimneypiece in the dining room, which adjoined the southern addition, was apparently the responsibility of William Bernard Sears. He was sick and absent from Mount Vernon during much of October 1775, but he returned in late fall to finish the chimneypiece and to paint the dining room and the new rooms (Lund Washington to GW, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0061" class="document">29 Sept.</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0105" class="document">5</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0164" class="document">15</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0193" class="document">22 Oct.</a>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0480" class="document">10 Dec. 1775</a>).</p>

   <p>GW wished to have the brick lining of the well replaced. The old lining was removed without great difficulty, but the tendency of the unsupported sides to fall in made the replacing of the lining a dangerous job which workmen were reluctant to undertake.
