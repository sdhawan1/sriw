   <p>Lord Dunmore, with about twelve hundred men including Maj. William Crawfords command, was at Fort Gower on the Great Hockhocking from which place he sent messengers to Andrew Lewis with instructions to join him near Chillicothe rather than at Point Pleasant at the mouth of the Great Kanawha as originally planned. Before Lewis could comply with the new orders his division of the army was attacked on 10 Oct. at Point Pleasant by the Shawnee chief Cornstalk and a large force of Shawnee and Mingo warriors. After a hard-fought battle the defeated Indians crossed the Ohio River, headed for
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-10-02-pb-0184">[184]</span>
the Shawnee towns. The Shawnee chiefs came to Camp Charlotte on the Pickaway Plains where Dunmore was encamped and agreed to a peace treaty, although some of the chiefs were bitterly opposed. The treaty set the Ohio River as the boundary between Indians and white settlers. Shawnee hostages were taken to ensure compliance with the treaty. For Dunmores proclamation regarding the treaty and his instructions to protect the Indians, see the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Virginia Gazette</span> (Dixon and Hunter; Williamsburg), 28 Jan. 1775. On 17 Dec. Col. Angus McDonald arrived in Williamsburg with the four hostages and their interpreter. Three of them are Warriors, viz. Imcatewhawa, or the Black Wolf; Wissecapoway, or Captain Morgan; Genusa, or the Judge; and the other is a young Man, called Neawah, who is the Snakes Son, a principal Warrior of that Nation (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Pennsylvania Gazette</span> [Philadelphia], 4 Jan. 1775). An Englishman who saw the four hostages in Winchester in December on their way to Williamsburg described them in detail as tall, manly, well-shaped men, of a Copper colour with black hair, quick piercing eyes, and good features. They were dressed as white men except for loincloths instead of breeches which they refuse to wear (Cresswell, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Journal</span>, 4950). The Point Pleasant victory kept the frontiers relatively free from Indian threats during the early years of the Revolution.</p>


   <p>Andrew Montour was a mixed-blood Seneca guide and served as a captain with the British forces during the French and Indian War. See <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ W. W. Abbot et al., eds. &lt;i&gt;The Papers of George Washington, Colonial Series&lt;/i&gt;. 10 vols. Charlottesville, Va., 198395. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Papers, Colonial Series</span></span>, 1:122. John Montours mother was the daughter of a Delaware chief, and so John Montour was considered a Delaware. He was educated in Philadelphia and adhered to the side of the colonists during the Revolution, although his loyalty was sometimes in question. Another John Montour, called Stuttering John, fought with the British in the Revolution and took part in the Wyoming Valley massacre.</p>

 
   <p>The town of Seekonk, or Salt Lick Town, was a Mingo town on the west bank of the Scioto River near present-day Columbus. Crawford, with about two hundred and fifty men, was sent against the town, and Dunmore assured him that if any plunder was taken it should be equally divided among the captors. The sale amounted to 35ol. 15s. halfpeny, when the captains of each company became responsible for the purchases made by their men. However, the commissioners settling the expenses of the war stopped this amount out of the officers pay. It was not until 1776 that the legislature agreed that the men were indeed entitled to the money from the sale of the plunder and ordered each officer on Crawfords expedition to give in a list of men who served on the expedition and to pay to each his share of the money (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Delegates of Virginia.

For another account of the attack on Salt Lick Town, see William Christian to William Preston, 8 Nov. 1774, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Reuben Gold Thwaites and Louise Phelps Kellogg, eds. &lt;i&gt;Documentary History of Dunmores War, 1774&lt;/i&gt;.
