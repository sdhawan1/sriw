   <p>GW left Great Meadows presumably on 16 June with his men and provisions, leaving Capt. James Mackay and the independent company at the nearly completed fort at the Meadows. The company, carrying the nine swivel guns brought up by George Muse (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-01-02-0066" class="document">GW to Dinwiddie, 10 June 1754</a>), intended to clear the road at Redstone Creek for the heavy artillery expected from Alexandria but, as GW noted in his journal, were extremely perplexed, our Waggons breaking very often (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig, eds. &lt;i&gt;The Diaries of George Washington&lt;/i&gt;. 6 vols.

From 18 to 21 June he began a series of unproductive conferences with the Indians which are described in detail in his journal. Unable to procure enough Indian support even to provide reliable scouts, GW was compelled to use his own relatively inexperienced men as scouts. Uncertain of the movements of the French and realizing the danger of dispersing his small force widely, on 27 June he dispatched a party under Capt. Andrew Lewis, Lt. Thomas Waggener, and Ens. John Fenton Mercer to continue work on the road and held his own troops at Gists Settlement to await further developments.</p>

   <p>Carlyle was too optimistic, for Dinwiddie wrote Carlyle on 27 June that he did not think the Messenger You sent, proper to carry any Money up to You (ibid.).</p>

   <p>GW and his troops left Alexandria for the Forks on 2 April 1754, and not until 9 June did Lt. Col. George Muse march the remainder of the Virginia Regiment into GWs camp at Great Meadows. The captains of the three companies that had remained behind in April were Robert Stobo, second captain, date of rank 6 Mar.; Andrew Lewis, third captain, 8 Mar.; and George Mercer, who was commissioned lieutenant on 25 Feb. and became a company commander when GW, Muse, and Adam Stephen moved up in rank in early June after Col. Joshua Frys death.</p>

   <p>The Castleman family was among the earliest families to settle in Frederick County. In GWs military accounts for 175558 there are payments on 12 April, 31 Aug., and 24 Sept. 1757 to Lodowick, William, and Jacob Castleman for horse hire after Deserters (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>).</p>

   <p>Draper Simon Wood was probably one of Carlyles six deputies. Wood served as Deputy Commissary of Stores and Provisions for his Majestys Forces in North America at Carlisle, Pa., during the Forbes expedition in 1758. He remarked then that he had served in the Station that I am now in since the commencement of this War (Henry Bouquet to James Burd et al., 6 June 1758, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ University of Virginia, Charlottesville ]">ViU</span>: John Forbes Papers).</p>

   <p>Peter Hog, whose commission as captain was dated 9 Mar. 1754, was present at the capitulation at Fort Necessity. He was among the Virginia officers whom Gen. Edward Braddock used in his campaign in 1755. When GW reconstituted the Virginia Regiment in the fall after Braddocks defeat, he assigned Hog to a post on the frontier in Augusta County, where he served until GW relieved him of his command in July 1757. For further information about Peter Hogs military career, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-02-02-0009" class="document">GWs first letter to Hog of 6 Sept. 1755</a>.</p>

   <p>John West, Jr., a lieutenant in the Virginia Regiment, delivered at least 21 recruits to GW. Although GW later listed them as having been in service before 3 July 1754, he noted on the return of Captain Wests new recruits of June 1754 that they were not incorporated (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>).</p>

   <p>James Towers was first an ensign (25 Jan. 1754) in the Virginia Regiment and had recently (9 June) been made lieutenant. He was at Fort Necessity on 3 July and remained with the Virginia forces until December, only a short time after GWs resignation.</p>

   <p>Capt. James Mackays independent company from South Carolina was
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0145">[145]</span>
authorized to have two lieutenants and one ensign. Mackay also brought along at least one cadet. Lt. Peter Mercier of the company was killed at Fort Necessity, and Ens. John Grey was then promoted to lieutenant. The other lieutenant was probably Paul Demer, who succeeded to Mackays captaincy. A cadet, Joseph Lloyd, was wounded at Fort Necessity.</p>

   <p>The 4 hogsheads of tobacco were brought down to the Alexandria warehouse for inspection from GWs Bullskin Plantation in Frederick County. On 25 Nov. 1754, after returning to Mount Vernon, GW paid Simeon Rice for the Carriage of 10 hogsheads of tobacco delivered to this date (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Manuscript Ledger Book 1, 1750-72, in George Washington Papers, Library of Congress. ]">Ledger A</span>, 17, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>).</p>
