   <p>Vanderpools house was probably near the present village of Vanderpool in what is now Highland County. Here Jackson River turns west through Vanderpools Gap in Back Creek Mountain. Vanderpool may have been Abraham Vanderpool, from Wallpack, Morris County, N.J., who held land on the South Fork of the South Branch as early as 1748 and is known to have been living on the Greenbrier River in 1753.</p>

   <p>Miller was Capt. John Miller who lived about 15 miles up Jackson River from Fort Dinwiddie. In July of this year Millers was chosen as the site for one of the forts to be built and garrisoned for the protection of the Augusta County frontier. Wilsons may have been the land of William and Stephen Wilson on Jackson River at the mouth of Bolar Run, earlier called Wilsons Mill Run, near John Millers place.</p>

   <p>There was an Alexander Gillespie in the Augusta County rangers in 1758. He served in the company of Andrew Lewiss brother Capt.

   <p>In 1756 a man named Felix Gilbert was a soldier in Capt. George Wilsons Augusta militia company. He was probably the same man who later became a merchant in Augusta County, a justice of the county, and a member of the Augusta Parish vestry.
