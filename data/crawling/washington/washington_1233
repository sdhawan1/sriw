   <p>Fort Lyttelton, more often called Vauses fort, was on the South Fork of the Roanoke River. Lt. Thomas Bullitt had been there building the fort on 24 July when GW ordered him to replace Peter Hog as commander of the company pending Major Lewiss arrival. Dickinsons fort was on Jackson River about thirty miles from Fort Dinwiddie.</p>

   <p>Lewiss old company was the 1st company of the Virginia Regiment. Capt. Peter Hog had been its commander in Augusta County since the regiment was reorganized in September 1755 with GW as its colonel and Lewis its major. For a listing of the men who had been in Hogs company, see A Necessary Roll of Cloths Wanting to Compleat that part of Majr Lewis Compy Late Capt.

   <p>In early July 1757 Lewis was in Fredericksburg receiving the men drafted in the different counties. Several junior officers were with him there to conduct the new recruits to Winchester. A sizable number of the recruits deserted en route.

   <p>Capt. James Campbell of the Augusta militia owned land on the north bank of Roanoke River to the west of Neelys, or Mason, Creek. The council of war held on 27 July 1756 in Augusta County (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-03-02-0289&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0032#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0032" class="document">GW to Dinwiddie, 4 Aug. 1756, n.32</a>) called for a fort to be built on Campbells land, 12 miles from Vauses and 13 miles from Neal McNeals plantation on Carvin Creek. This fort was built to the east of Campbells house and was called Fort Lewis. It became a principal supply depot for the southern frontier. Old Cloyds probably refers to the house of David Cloyd, who lived near the head of Rentfroe Creek, a branch of Tinker, or Buffalo, Creek. Cloyds house may have been the residence of Capt. William Preston during this period, and Prestons fort, or Fort William, was only a few miles west of Cloyds.</p>

   <p>This was Capt. John Dickinson (17311799) of the Augusta County militia. Craig Creek flows north into the James River a few miles above the mouth of Catawba Creek. The fort on Craig Creek was to be built at the mouth of Johns Creek, according to the recommendations of both GW and the council of war held 27 July in Augusta County.

It would be, according to GWs proposal, 18 miles from Dickinsons fort on Jackson River and 15 miles from Fort William in the Catawba Valley. In 1758 the legislature ordered that Capt. John Dickinson be paid for sundry persons employed in building a fort at Craigs creek (7 <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William Waller Hening, ed. &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia, from the First Session of the Legislature, in the Year 1619&lt;/i&gt;. 13 vols. 181923.

   <p>During the war William Preston (17291783) was active as a militia officer and a ranger captain on the Augusta County frontier. The North River is probably what is now called the Maury River. It flows southward into the James River where it forms the Forks of the James. There was a sizable settlement in that area by 1757. The region suffered a devastating raid in late July in which two men were killed near Purgatory Mountain and nine women and children captured (Preston Register).</p>

   <p>William Preston seems to have been stationed at this time at Fort George on the west bank of Bullpasture River. Earlier in the year Preston built the fort on the orders of Andrew Lewis. The fort, located on the land of Capt. Wallas Estill (Astin) of the Augusta militia, was 80 feet square. For a description of the fort, see Preston to Lewis, 7 April 1757, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison ]">WHi</span>: Draper Collection, IQQ, 15253.</p>

A few weeks later Lewis received a letter from Dinwiddie complaining that he remembered ordering three Comps. of 60 Men each, but till now I knew neither the Officers Names or their Stations, only Dickeson &amp; Preston (Dinwiddie to Lewis, 19 Sept. 1757, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Virginia Historical Society, Richmond ]">ViHi</span>: Dinwiddie Papers). One of the other two companies of militia which Lewis reports here as still on duty was probably that of a Captain Smith who was stationed on the South Branch of Potomac.</p>

   <p>Henry Woodward was stationed somewhere on the South Branch until he was ordered in July 1757 to Vauses fort.</p>

   <p>The militia sergeant may have been a Sergeant Henry who was listed in the Preston Register as having been killed at Fort Dinwiddie in September.</p>
