<p>Your two Letters of the 13th and 14th I shall answer Paragraphically. The Expedition against the Shawnesse I hope will be attended with Success, as two Women who were taken Prisoners made their Escape mention their being in their Towns &amp; did not hear of their Intention of moving.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0001-ptr">1</a></p>
<p>You have done very right in ordering the Men to be traind in the Indian Method of fighting but I can give You no express Commands in regard to taking the Field but during Your absence order them to be employd in any Thing that may be necessary to keep them from Idleness. I approve of the Forts You have built, as it encourages the People to return to their Plantations, &amp; will be a Protection to them.</p>
<p>I expect the Govr of Pensylvania will send me a Plan of Operations for next Year for my Approbation; &amp; on Your return from General Shirley call on him &amp; desire a Letter to me, I wrote him lately &amp; cannot now write him, therefore Nothing can be determind on till Your return.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> I agree with You, we cannot expect Horses, Waggons &amp;ca till the old Score is paid: I wrote pressingly to Genl Shirley on that Head, but as yet no Answer; if he shoud give his Orders there is Money here sufficient to pay them all, but as yet I am not furnishd with their Demds which they shoud choose a proper Person to sollicit their Affair for them.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0003-ptr">3</a></p>
<p>I enclose You a Commission for calling a General Court Martial, drawn up by the Atto. Genl agreeable to the Act of Assembly, which You are to fill up the Blanks.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> As for Cloathing You shoud apply to the Committee,<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0005" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> for You know I cant touch their Money; but I expected You woud have furnishd me with an Accot of the Cloathing issued to the Men by You &amp; Colo. Fairfax that was at Maj. Carlyles &amp;ca that I may be paid for
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-02-02-pb-0291">[291]</span>
them &amp; I doubt not You make the proper Stoppages on this Acctpray send me a particular Acct of the Cloathing.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0006" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0006-ptr">6</a></p>
<p>I think Provisions for 1000 Men for one Year is sufficient; &amp; You did well to turn out those Beeves not fit for Slaughter to grazing, which may be of great use next Summer. I agree to Your appointing Mr Dennis McCarty in the room of Mr Polson &amp; I shall be glad the Vacancies that may happen be filled up from the Volunteers giving me previous Notice thereof for my Approbation.</p>
<p>I doubt not Capt. Hogg will comply with Your Orders to account for the Money he has received. Capt. Stewarts purchasing his Horses &amp;ca must also remain till You return. I am fully of Opinion, &amp; hereby order Ensign DeKeiser be dismissed the Service, at same time I expect You will give Orders to discourage Gaming, as it viciates the Mind &amp; occasions Excesses &amp; Quarrels.</p>
<p>It was a great Neglect of Mr Prentis not to send You the Particulars shipt in the Sloop, I have now ordered him to furnish You therewith.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0007" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0007-ptr">7</a></p>
<p>Yours of the 13th gives me a good deal of Concern.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0008" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0008-ptr">8</a> It is very just that the Maryland &amp; No. Carolina Forces shoud furnish their own Provisions, or a particular Accot kept of the Supplies given them to make a proper Charge to Each Colony, tho Capt. Dagworthy very unjustly says they all have an equal right as its in the Kings Garrison, tho. purchasd by this ColonyThat Fort was built by His Majestys Money &amp; this Countrys; &amp; as a Kings Garison it is not to be esteemd the Property of the Proprietor of Maryland; as His Majesty has an undoubted Right to build Forts in any of the Colonies, &amp; I ordered it to be built by his Commands. Genl Braddock appointed Colo. Innes to be Governor, &amp; when he left he directed Colo. Stephens to Command till his return; how Colo. Stephens came to give the command to Capt. Dagworthy I know not; but this Step is the Origin of the great Dispute subsisting; &amp; I cannot help blaming Stephens for tamely giving up the Command given him by Colo. Innes, which he assured me when here was the Case.</p>
<p>As to his detaining our Provisions till he sees proper to deliver them is inconsistent with Reason &amp; Justice; as we are at the Charge of a Commissary to take care of them, &amp; the Fort I judgd
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-02-02-pb-0292">[292]</span>
the safest Place to keep them; which You must represent in the strongest Terms when You go to General ShirleyHis Answer to my Letter was, that he left the Accomodation of that Affair to Govr Sharpe, which is what I coud not have expected, as I applied to him as Comdr In Chief of the Forces, &amp; he knew the Attachment that Mr Sharpe had to Capt. Dagworthy, it was giving the Power out of his own Hands, &amp; no Doubt the Govr pressd this Method of adjusting it, which I do not take kind of Mr Sharpe.</p>
<p>I agree to Your going to Genl Shirley; You may present the Memo[rial] from the Officers to him, which I have recommended: but I fear Success because His Majesty sends over Officers to the different Regiments to be raisd; but You will know his Sentiments thereonHowever I again repeat my desire to him to grant You &amp; the two Field Officers Brevate Commissions to put an End to this unhappy Dispute; how far he may have Power to put Your Regiment on the Establishmt I know notbut I have earnestly applied for blank Commissions from Home, I wish I may succeed.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0009" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0298-fn-0009-ptr">9</a> You have my Letter to the General with a detail of the whole Affair; but You will be able to represent it more fully when You come to converse with him.</p>
<p>I cannot see Capt. Dagworthy can deduce any right on his former Comission from the King, as that was cancelld by his receiving a Sum of Money in lieu of half Pay, &amp; that he now Commands a very small Company of Provincials, himself &amp; them paid by the Govermt of MarylandHis Majestys Commission takes place of any Governors Commission when the Regulars are joind with the Provincials; but this is not the Case in this Dispute, which You must urge to the General.</p>
<p>I have lately wrote to all the Governors &amp; now I have no Time, or have I any thing now to write them. Deliver my Letter to the General with Your own Hand, &amp; I hope he will comply with my Request. In Your return see Govr Morris &amp; make Yourself Master of what Plan that Gent. Proposes for the next Campaign, which will in some measure make me able to concert a proper Plan for our Forces. You know Dispatch is absolutely necessary. I wish You an agreeable Journey, &amp; a safe return. I remain Sir Your most humble Servt</p>

   <p>Dinwiddie must have been referring to Mary Draper Ingles, who had recently escaped from the Shawnee. Her long trip, with only an old German woman as a companion, from the Lower Shawnee Town on the Ohio back to the Virginia settlements on the New River in the fall of 1755 was a remarkable feat. Mrs. Ingles was among those who had been captured on 31 July 1755 at Drapers Meadow by a party of Indians who also killed James Patton, the county lieutenant of Augusta County.</p>

   <p>Dinwiddie wrote Gov. Robert Hunter Morris on 2 Jan.: As You are now enabled [by the Pennsylvania Assemblys appropriation of 60,000], I hope You will plan out operations for next Spring, &amp; I shall be ready to join in any Thing for the Public Service, and concluded with the wish that Morris would let him know his plans as soon as possible (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Virginia Historical Society, Richmond ]">ViHi</span>: Dinwiddie Papers).

   <p>The excerpt that Dinwiddie enclosed in his letter to GW comprises about half of the letter that he wrote to William Shirley on 24 Jan. 1756 (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Virginia Historical Society, Richmond ]">ViHi</span>: Dinwiddie Papers). The excerpt reads:</p>


   <p>Govr Sharpe has not answd Yr Ex.s intents in removg the Dispute between Co. W. &amp; C[ap]t. D.; he has orderd him to keep the Comd of the Ft wch he does in an absolute MannerWe have purchasd &amp; laid in Proviss. for 1000 for one Year, as the Ft was the most safe Place they were depositd there &amp; a Commissary appointed at the Charge of this Cotry, he will not allow him to discharge his Duty but refuses any of the Proviss. to be touchd but by his Orders: &amp; tho. the Proviss. are supplied by the Cotry he insists on a Right to supply his own Men from our Magazine, tho. Myld pays no part of the Charge , he otherways acts in an arbitrary manner, &amp; insists on his Rank superior to any of our Offrs &amp; he has not above 30 Men wn Co. W. has upwds of 500. This Ft was built by Virtue of H. Mys Instructs. to me &amp; by my Orders to Co. Innes then in the Pay of this Govt &amp; wth a great charge to this Country; tis true it happens to be in Myld, but I presume H. My has a Right to build a Ft where he pleases in any of H. Colonies; &amp; the Guns mounted are Guns sent by H. My for the ser. of Virga it cannot reasonably be suggested that H. M. intended them for the Propriety of MyldGl Bdk gave a Como. to Co. Innes to be Gr of the Ft his private Affairs callg him to his Estate in No. Cara he appointed Lt Co. Stephens to Comd in his AbsenceCt. D. with his pretended Rank wrested the Comd from him witht any Rule but his Como. of Ct. in the Canada Expedtn tho not on the half pay List, but recd a Sum of Mo: in lieu by his acceptg that Mo. I am of Opinion he revokd the Como.This Affr makes much Noise here that I thot it necessary to send Co. W. to You who can be more particular. If I was to call the Assembly now, I know this Affr has raisd the rancour of the People so much that they wd go into Extremes of Resentmt &amp; do no Business for the Service. I am sorry I have occasion to be so long on this Affr but as it makes much Noise here, witht You interpose Yr Autho. I do not know wt will be the ConsequenceAs formerly I desire the Favo. of a Brevate Como. to Co. W. &amp; the other two F[iel]d Offrs &amp; that You wd please reinstate Co. Stephens to the Comd of the Ft till Gr Innes returnsAs Comdr in Chief of the Forces this is in Yr Power only &amp;

And really Myld has behavd so very tardy in regd to the Expedtn that they have no Claim to my FavrsI must refer You to Co. W. for any further Particulars. . . . I forgot to mentn that Ft Cumbd being a Kings Ft I cannot see the Proprietrs Govr can have any Right to appt a Govr &amp; more so as it has been built by this GovtThe Right is in You &amp; I doubt not You will assume it in order to restore Peace.</p>
