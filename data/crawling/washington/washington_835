   <p>Before giving up command of the forces in America in June 1756, Gov. William Shirley made John Winslow of Plymouth, Mass., commander of the New England troops recruited for the summers Crown Point campaign in New York. Winslow and his army reached Fort Edward from Albany by 20 July and then pushed on in early August to Fort William Henry on Lake George. Winslows expedition against the French at Fort Ticonderoga and Grown Point on Lake Champlain was brought to a halt on 20 Aug. 1756 when word came from Loudoun at Albany that Oswego had fallen and that Winslow should remain on the defensive.</p>

   <p>Loudoun recalled Winslow and officers of his staff from Lake George to Albany on 3 Aug. shortly after Loudouns own arrival there, and asked them to state in writing whether the provincial troops would be willing to act in conjunction with the regular forces and under the command of Loudoun, the kings commander in chief. The officers expressed their own willingness to do so but suggested it would please the provincial troops to act separately in so far as it is consistent with His Majestys Service (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Lawrence Henry Gipson. &lt;i&gt;The British Empire before the American Revolution&lt;/i&gt;. 15 vols.

   <p>It was agreed at a council of war called by General Shirley on 25 May 1756 that the 44th Regiment of Foot under the command of Lt. Col. Thomas Gage and the 48th Regiment under that of Lt. Col. Ralph Burton, both of which regiments had participated in the Braddock campaign in 1755, should join Winslow and his provincials in the attack on Crown Point. For further

   <p>The 35th Regiment of Foot under Col. Charles Otway and the 42d (or Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot landed in New York on 15 June and by this time were in Albany. The equipment and new recruits for the regiments did not get to New York from England until mid-August.</p>

   <p>Upon his arrival in North America, Col. Daniel Webb was supposed to serve as commander in chief of the forces in North America in the place of William Shirley until the arrival of Gen. James Abercromby. Abercromby, in turn, was to have the command only until Lord Loudoun came. Webb landed in New York on 7 June and waited there until Abercromby came into port on 16 June. The two officers then traveled up the Hudson River to Albany where on 25 June Abercromby took over from Shirley. A month later, 23 July, Loudoun arrived in New York.</p>

   <p>Lt. Col. John Bradstreet, who as a captain had been in command at Oswego for a time in 1755, was given by Shirley in March 1756 the crucial task of getting supplies to threatened Oswego. Bradstreet recruited about 2,000 bateaumen for this task, and by early June he had delivered to Oswego supplies sufficient to maintain 5,000 men for six months. According to Shirley, Bradstreets engagement with the Indians which is described here took place on 3 July on the Onondaga River 11 miles from Oswego. He reported that twenty of Winslows men were killed and twenty-four were wounded, while the French and Indians lost at least, 100 (Shirley to Henry Fox, 26 July 1756, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Charles Henry Lincoln, ed. &lt;i&gt;Correspondence of William Shirley: Governor of Massachusetts and Military Commander in America, 1731-1760&lt;/i&gt;. 2 vols. New York, 1912. ]">Lincoln, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Shirley Correspondence</span></span>, 2:48892). Webb did not march from Albany with the 44th Regiment to reinforce Lt. Col. James F. Mercer at Oswego until 9 Aug. He was at the German Flatts on the Mohawk River, far from Oswego, when he learned on 17 Aug. that the comte de Montcalm and his forces on 14 Aug. had completed their conquest of the forts at the great trading center at Oswego.</p>

   <p>Robert Rogers (17311795), one of the more romantic figures of the French and Indian War in America, remained in the thick of things as an officer from the time of his participation in Shirleys proposed expedition to Nova Scotia in 1755 until his service in the defense of Detroit against Pontiac in 1763. In 1776 GW ordered Rogers to be detained as a suspected spy. Thereafter Rogers fought for the British and in 1780 went to England to live.</p>

   <p>Maj. Edward Brice Dobbs, commander of the North Carolina forces that were sent to New York, returned to Carolina in the fall of 1756 after having been seized with a confirmed Rheumatism (Arthur Dobbs to William Pitt, 19 Mar. 1759, in Saunders, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">N.C. Col. Rec.</span>, 6:18). His father Arthur Dobbs, governor of North Carolina, appointed him naval officer of the colony in 1758. Young Dobbs held this office and was a member of the North Carolina council until the spring of 1759, when he went to Gibraltar to rejoin the regiment of fusiliers in which he had held a lieutenancy.

   <p>It seems probable that Godfry Rowe did not receive the lieutenants commission in the 44th Regiment after all; a Godfrey Roe, however, did later receive an ensigncy dated 6 June 1757 in the 48th Regiment. This Lieutenant Rowe (Roe) may have been the officer who was at Fort Cumberland in the fall and winter of 175556. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-03-02-0354" class="document">Orders, 19 Sept. 1755</a>.</p>

   <p>The uncle of GWs aide-de-camp George Mercer was Capt. James Mercer (17161757) of the 48th Regiment of Foot. He often has been confused with the Lt. Col. James F. Mercer who was in command at Oswego and was killed when it fell in August 1756.</p>
