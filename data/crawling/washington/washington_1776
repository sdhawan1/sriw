 See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-06-02-0026" class="document">Orderly Book, 21 September24 November 1758.</a> The brigade orders at the beginning and at the end of this entry are GWs. The general orders and the after orders in between were almost certainly issued by Bouquet, who seems to have come up to Washingtons Camp during the day. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-06-02-0125" class="document">Forbes to GW, 1920 November</a>.</p>


   <p>The post at Turtle Creek, known as Washingtons Camp, was occupied by the army until 22 Nov. when Bouquet moved the army across the creek toward Bouquets camp, which was less than twelve miles from Fort Duquesne.</p>

</div>
<div id="fn" class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#GEWN-02-06-02-0126-fn-0001-ptr" id="GEWN-02-06-02-0126-fn-0001">1</a>

   <p>What follows are GWs orders for breaking each corps, or element, of the 3d Brigade into a number of divisions commanded by captains, the divisions into platoons commanded by subalterns, and these into squads commanded by sergeants. Forbess general orders in Orderly Book, 21 Nov., indicate that the other two brigades were similarly organized at this time. In A Return of the Number of Platoons in Brigadier Washingtons Brigade And what Each Consists of, dated 20 Nov. 1758 (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>), GW gives the number of men in each of the platoons in the 13 divisions of his brigade. Each of the 5 divisions of the 1st Virginia Regiment was divided into 4 platoons with 2 sergeants and from 20 to 29 men in each, for a total of 515 privates out of a total of 595 officers and soldiers in the regiment. The 2 companies or divisions of artificers had 3 platoons each with an overall total of 90, both officers and men. In the single division of North Carolina forces there were 3 platoons totaling 56 officers and soldiers. The 3 divisions in the Maryland contingent, each with 2 platoons, came to a total of 117 officers and men, while the 2 divisions and 4 platoons of officers and men from the Lower Counties came to a total of 70. In sum, the 3d Brigade of Forbess army as it approached Fort Duquesne and
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-06-02-pb-0150">[150]</span>
possible combat had 929 officers and soldiers broken up into 13 divisions composed of 39 platoons. Also on 20 Nov., at Washingtons Camp, returns of both GWs 1st Virginia Regiment and his 3d Brigade were prepared and are in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>. They confirm the figures given here in the return of the platoons in the 3d Brigade.</p>

   <p>Presumably Lt. Col. George Mercer and a contingent of the 2d Virginia Regiment arrived at Washingtons Camp with their brigade commander, Colonel Bouquet, on this day after GW had issued his brigade orders (B. O.). See the After Orders that follow.</p>

   <p>Forbes wrote that the party of Catawba and George Croghans Indians should be at Washingtons Camp by nightfall. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-06-02-0125&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-06-02-0125-fn-0002#GEWN-02-06-02-0125-fn-0002" class="document">Forbes to GW, 19 Nov., n.2</a>.</p>

   <p>GW with most of his brigade were to begin on 21 Nov. to open the road to Bouquets camp to be built on Thompson Run less than twelve miles from Fort Duquesne and not that far from Camp Washington. Apparently GW and his brigade marched as far as, or almost as far as, the site of Bouquets camp and began to cut the road back toward Washingtons Camp along the trail blazed by Evan Shelby (see GWs battalion orders immediately following). On 21 Nov. Forbes sent a large work party from Bouquets brigade to cut the road from Camp Washington until it met up with GWs party, when both should return to Washingtons Camp (<a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-06-02-0127" class="document">Orderly Book, 21 Nov.</a>; <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-06-02-0128" class="document">Francis Halkett to GW, 21 Nov.</a>). Forbes explained to Bouquet on 22 Nov. that he had not pushed on that afternoon to Camp Bouquet with the other two brigades because he had no reason either to expect that the road was better, or better opend than what I had come, which was . . . monstrously and Carelessly done (Stevens, <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Donald H. Kent et al., eds. &lt;i&gt;The Papers of Henry Bouquet&lt;/i&gt;. 6 vols. Harrisburg, Pa., 1951-94. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Bouquet Papers</span></span>, 2:6067). When Forbes moved his army out of Camp Washington on the morning of 22 Nov., Bouquet and the 1st Brigade moved ahead to prepare the next camp, Camp Bouquet, which Forbes and the rest of his army did not reach until 23 November. The Old Path was the trading path to the Forks of the Ohio (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-06-02-0128&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-06-02-0128-fn-0003#GEWN-02-06-02-0128-fn-0003" class="document">Francis Halkett to GW, 21 Nov. 1758, n.3</a>).</p>

   <p>GWs orders in this paragraph are directed to all the units in his brigade except for the Carolinians and Marylanders whom Bouquet had already sent ahead to reconnoiter.</p>
