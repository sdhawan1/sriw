   <p>John Mercer (17041768), of Stafford County, was a lawyer who since the early 1740s had been retained by the Custises, first by John Custis (16781749) and then by his son Daniel Parke Custis (17111757), to counsel them in the Dunbar case. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-06-02-0164-0002&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-06-02-0164-0002-fn-0005#GEWN-02-06-02-0164-0002-fn-0005" class="document">note 5</a>. From 1757 he acted in the same capacity for Daniel Parke Custiss widow, later GWs wife, and for her two children. Mercer, who obtained a large loan from Martha Custis, served as GWs attorney in the settlement of the Custis estate until shortly after the final settlement in 1761.</p>

   <p>Upon Daniel Parke Custiss death Martha Custis became the common-law guardian of her children and would remain so, unless another were appointed, until the children reached the age of 14. Talk of appointing a male guardian seems to have first come up in the fall of 1758 as a result of developments in the Dunbar case (see note 5). John Mercer wrote Martha Custis 11 Oct. 1758: However as you seemd determined in Case the Suit should be renewed to have some Gent. of Reputation &amp; Fortune appointed Your Sons Guardian I enquired in a round about manner of the Speaker [John Robinson] if such a thing had ever been proposed to him, he said not, but added, that it would be to no manner of purpose as he would not upon any Account undertake it, as it would be attended with so much trouble as must necessarily accompany the management of so large an Estate (as your Son was intitled to) &amp; at such a distance from him. As I observed that I apprehended you would be satisfied with his being appointed his Guardian for the management of his Law Suits, in which his Advice and Character might be of great benefit to the young Gentleman &amp; that his Estate might be continued under the same management as at present, he said upon that Condition if you desired, he would very readily undertake the matter &amp; do your Son all the Service he could either
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-06-02-pb-0212">[212]</span>
   by his advice or Interest. This, Madam, I thought proper to advise you of, as you may thereby be better enabled to form your Resolution upon that head (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Virginia Historical Society, Richmond ]">ViHi</span>: Custis Papers). Then, on 2 Nov. 1758, two months before her marriage to GW, Mercer wrote Mrs. Custis: I received all the Papers together with your Letter and should have awaited on the Speaker in two or three days after but I heard he was gone for a few days out of Town. On Saturday last I applied to him &amp; he promised to be in Court that day but something prevented. however this Day he came to Court &amp; was admitted not only your Sons but your Daughters Guardian to defend &amp; prosecute such Suits as may be for their Interest, for it seems that not only your Son but yourself &amp; Daughter will be Parties to the Suit of Dunbar here (ibid.). In his response (<a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-06-02-0164-0003" class="document">doc. II</a>), Mercer suggests to GW that his marriage to Mrs. Custis puts him in the position to assume the guardianship in her right, but he advises him to delay doing so until after the estate was divided and finally settled. GW seems to have taken his advice, for it was not until 21 Oct. 1761 at the time of the final settlement of the estate that the General Court appointed GW guardian of the two children, in place of John Robinson (Order of the General Court, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Va. ]">ViLxW</span>: Washingtons Account Book). For GWs decision in April 1759 to secure an order from the General Court giving him the administration of the childrens property, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-06-02-0164-0001&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-06-02-0164-0001-fn-0006#GEWN-02-06-02-0164-0001-fn-0006" class="document">Editorial Note, 20 April 17595 Nov. 1761, n.6</a>. GW remained the manager of the property of the two young Custises until 1773, when Patsy died and Jacky was preparing to marry, rendering each year annual accounts of the credits and debits of their estates for the preceding year.</p>

   <p>At this time the Custis estate again was being threatened by the claims first brought against it as early as 1723 by one Thomas Dunbar, renamed Dunbar Parke, of Antigua. When Daniel Parke Custiss grandfather Daniel Parke (b. 1669) was murdered in 1710 at Antigua where he was in residence as the British governor of the Leeward Islands, it was discovered that Parke had left his Antigua property valued at more than 30,000 to Lucy Chester, the young daughter of a Mrs. Catherine Chester of that place. The Antigua property was to pass to Lucys heirs provided that upon her marriage she and her husband changed their name to Parke. Under the terms of the will, Colonel Parkes daughter Frances Parke Custis, the mother of Daniel Parke Custis, was to get her fathers Virginia and English property, out of which Parkes legal debts, presumably in Virginia and England, were to be paid. Nearly fifteen years after Parkes death, and long after Frances Custis herself had died, John Custis, Francess husband and Daniel Parke Custiss father, received notice from Dunbar Parke, who had taken the name upon his marriage to Lucy Chester, that the Frances Parke Custis estate must reimburse him for up to 10,000 which had been paid out of his wifes inheritance to settle Col. Daniel Parkes Antiguan debts. The point at issue was whether Parkes will required only that the Custises pay his Virginia and English debts or that they pay all of his debts, including those in Antigua. Lawyers on both sides remained active off and on from the mid1720s. At the time of John Custiss death in 1749 (Dunbar Parke died in 1734) the case still had not come to trial. Dunbars heirs renewed the suit in 1750. When the trial was finally held before the Virginia General Court in April 1754, it was dismissed. In July 1757 the Privy Council
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-06-02-pb-0213">[213]</span>
reversed the Virginia courts decision, which meant that the case should go back to Virginia for retrial. It was upon word of this that Martha Custis suggested to John Mercer the appointment of a male guardian for her children (see note 4), and it was with the reopening of the case in mind that GW posed his eighth and ninth questions to John Mercer.
