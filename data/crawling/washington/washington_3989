<p>The Committee then proceeded to the Consideration of such Matters as have been mentioned in the Generals Letters to the Congress upon which no Order had been made.</p>
<p>First. What Steps are necessary to be pursued with Regard to Dr Church? If guilty, the Articles for the Government of the Army point out a very inadequate Punishment, &amp; to set him at Liberty must be exceedingly dangerous?</p>
<p>Upon a Discussion of all Circumstances it was agreed to refer Doctor Church for Tryal &amp; Punishment to the General Court of Massachusetts Bay: But that no Procedure be had hereupon untill the Pleasure of the Congress be known on the late Application made by the General.</p>
<span class="pb center" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-03-02-02-pb-0197">[197]</span>
<p>2. What Distinctions are necessary to be made between Vessels &amp; Cargoes taken by the armed Vessels in the Pay of the Continent &amp; those taken by Individuals. Should not the fitting out of Privateers by Individuals be done under some Authority &amp; Accidental Captures subject to some Regulations to prevent Piracies &amp; other capital Abuses, which may arise?</p>
<p>Agreed that the General Court ought properly to take Cognizance of all armed Vessels fitted out by Individuals in this Province &amp; that Commissions should be granted in such Cases; at least that Captures be made under some Authority. That Captures made by armed Vessels in the Pay of the Continent be disposed of by the General for the publick Use untill the Continental Congress give farther Direction.</p>
<p>The Delegates then proposed to the Consideration of the Members what Number of effective Men it may be expected that the Colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut &amp; Rhode Island could &amp; would furnish by the 10th March next &amp; on what Terms.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Gentlemen were of Opinion that 20,000 effective Men might be raised in this Province to serve the next Campaign if absolutely necessary on the Terms of the present Army viz. A Coat, 40/ <img class="char" src="images/char-per-trans.png" alt="[per]"/> Month, one Months Wages being advanced&amp; a greater Number to come on a special Emergency.</p>
<p>The Connecticut Gentlemen were of Opinion that 8000 Men may be raised in their Province to serve the next Campaign on the Terms of the present Army viz. 40/ <img class="char" src="images/char-per-trans.png" alt="[per]"/> Month &amp; 40/ Bounty.</p>
<p>The President of New Hampshire Convention gave his Opinion that his Colony could furnish 3000 Men for the next Campaign at the Rate of 40/ <img class="char" src="images/char-per-trans.png" alt="[per]"/> Month without a Bounty unless a Bounty was given by the adjoining Colonies, in which Case they would expect it.</p>
<p>The Governour of Rhode Island gave his Opinion that Province could not go farther than they had done this Campaign viz. to raise 1500 Men on the same Terms.</p>
<p>Upon considering the additional Instruction<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-02-02-0175-0003-fn-0019" id="GEWN-03-02-02-0175-0003-fn-0019-ptr">19</a> it was unanimously agreed that the Number of Forces necessary for the Northern Department depended so much on Events &amp; particularly the Success of the present Expeditions against Canada that no probable Calculation can be made at this Timetherefore deferred.</p>

<p>It was then deliberated what should be done with Tory Property how is it to be applied or treated? Some of the Tories have Estates near the Camp at Cambridge, which have Wood upon them &amp; other Articles wanted for the Army ought they to be meddled with?<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-02-02-0175-0003-fn-0020" id="GEWN-03-02-02-0175-0003-fn-0020-ptr">20</a></p>
<p>Agreed that the Determination of this Matter be referred to the Congress.</p>
<p>The General then proposed the following Question? Should there not be a reasonable Price fixed upon Wood, Hay &amp; other Articles wanted for the Army to prevent Imposition &amp; Extortion.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-02-02-0175-0003-fn-0021" id="GEWN-03-02-02-0175-0003-fn-0021-ptr">21</a></p>
<p>Agreed that if it be indispensably necessary, such Articles should be valued &amp; taken at such Valuation for the Use of the Army and that a Regulation corresponding herewith be recommended to the General Court of Massachusetts Bay.</p>
<p>The Conference then broke up with the several Governours of Connecticut &amp; Rhode Island the President of the Convention of New Hampshire &amp; the Committee of Council for Massachusetts Bay.</p>

<p>7. Ought not Negroes to be excluded from the new Inlistment especially such as are Slavesall were thought improper by the Council of Officers?<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-02-02-0175-0003-fn-0023" id="GEWN-03-02-02-0175-0003-fn-0023-ptr">23</a></p>
<p>Agreed. that they be rejected altogether.</p>

   <p>This amendment corrects an error apparently made in taking many of the Continental articles of war from the Massachusetts articles. Continental article 2, which regulates behavior at religious services, is the first Massachusetts article, and Continental article 3, which prohibits profanity, is the second of the Massachusetts articles. Continental article 1, which does not appear in the Massachusetts articles, concerns the subscribing of the articles of war and includes no punishments (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington Chauncey Ford et al., eds. &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789&lt;/i&gt;. 34 vols.
