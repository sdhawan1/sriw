   <p>Sir John St. Clair (Sinclair; d. 1767), Braddocks hot-tempered and hardworking quartermaster, was styled a Scottish baronet by his contemporaries although no record of the creation of the title has been found (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ George E. Cokayne, ed. &lt;i&gt;Complete Baronetage&lt;/i&gt;. 5 vols. Exeter, England, 19001906. ]">Cokayne, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Complete Baronetage</span></span>, 4 : 301). He was appointed to the much coveted position of deputy quartermaster general for the forces in North America on 15 Oct. 1754. He landed in Virginia on 9 Jan. 1755 to begin securing the supplies and facilities that Braddocks troops would soon need. Dinwiddie on meeting St. Clair found him a Gent. of much Merit &amp; great Knowledge in Military Affairs, he has been at most Courts in Europe, &amp; his Observats on them are very judicious (Dinwiddie to Thomas, Lord Fairfax, 15 Jan. 1755, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Virginia Historical Society, Richmond ]">ViHi</span>: Dinwiddie Papers). At the time St. Clair was made quartermaster, some English journals reported that he was a lieutenant colonel in the 22d Regiment of Foot and was to rank as a colonel while serving as quartermaster, but he was, in truth, a major in his regiment given local rank as a lieutenant colonel in America.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0147-fn-0002-ptr" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0147-fn-0002">2</a>

   <p>Russell Chapman joined the 44th Regiment as a captain upon its establishment in 1741, was promoted to major of the regiment 10 years later, and obtained a lieutenant colonelcy in the Royal American Regiment on 5 Jan. 1756. The following year he asked to be allowed to retire on half pay because of illness. Permission was granted not so much on account of his poor health as his poor performance of duties with the Royal Americans.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0147-fn-0003-ptr" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0147-fn-0003">3</a>

   <p>St. Clair left Fort Cumberland on the morning of 29 May 1755 under orders to establish an advanced camp on the Little Youghiogheny (now Casselman) River about 25 miles west of the fort or, if that place could not be reached in 5 days marching, at some convenient spot along the way. He took with him two 6pound guns, 2 Coehorn mortars, 50 wagons containing 8 days provisions for 3,200 men, and Chapmans detachment. The detachment consisted of about 35 officers and 600 men, including 250 soldiers from the 44th and 48th regiments plus John Rutherfurd and Paul Demers independent companies and three companies of Virginia provincials. Difficult terrain hampered the partys progress almost from the start. It was not until 5 June, after 6 days of marching and 2 of rest, that St. Clair reached Little Meadows, about 3 miles east of the Little Youghiogheny. There on the following day the wagons were unloaded and sent back to Fort Cumberland under escort of Chapman and about 300 men for use in moving the main body of the army. St. Clair stayed at Little Meadows with the remainder of Chapmans detachment to clear a camp, build a shelter for the provisions, and erect fortifications.</p>

   <p>Charles Spendelow (d. 1755), a lieutenant in the Royal Navy since 1 May 1752, was attached to Braddocks army by orders of the Admiralty to assist in building floats for river crossings and mapping the area through which the army was to march. He also commanded the detachment of seamen assigned to Braddock. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-01-02-0127" class="document">GW to William Fairfax, 23 April 1755</a>. He was supposed to
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0296">[296]</span>
command a small armed vessel on Lake Ontario later in the campaign but was killed at the Battle of the Monongahela on 9 July 1755.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0147-fn-0005-ptr" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0147-fn-0005">5</a>

   <p>Spendelow and six of his seamen accompanied St. Clairs party on 29 May to assist with road work. Following Nemacolins Path, they crossed Wills (now Haystack) Mountain through Sandy Gap about 2 miles west of Fort Cumberland. This road was so steep and rough that it took all day to get the provision wagons over the mountain. In the process three wagons were destroyed, many were damaged, and numerous horses apparently broke down. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-01-02-0149" class="document">GW to George William Fairfax, 7 June 1755</a>. Faced with these difficulties, Braddock ordered further work done on the mountain route, for according to Robert Orme, he did not imagine any other road could be made, as a reconnoitring party had already been to explore the country (Captain Ormes Journal, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Winthrop Sargent, ed. &lt;i&gt;The History of an Expedition against Fort Du Quesne, in 1755; under Major-General Edward Braddock, Generalissimo of H.B.M. Forces in America&lt;/i&gt;. Philadelphia, 1856. ]">Sargent, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Braddocks Expedition</span></span>, 324). Spendelow, having returned with his men to Fort Cumberland on 1 June, went the next day to examine the road with Orme, Ralph Burton, and a midshipman. He soon left the others and arrived alone back at the fort about 2 <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">P.M.</span> with the news that the road builders could circumvent the mountains by going up Wills Creek through its Narrows to the mouth of a tributary (later called Braddock Run) and then up that stream to a junction with Nemacolins Path about a mile west of the mountain. A party of engineers and one of seamen began clearing a road along this route on the morning of 3 June.</p>

   <p>Sir Peter Halkett (c.16951755) was colonel of the 44th Regiment from 26 Feb. 1751 to his death at the Battle of the Monongahela 9 July 1755. A Scottish baronet, Halkett served in the House of Commons 173441 and fought against the Jacobite rebels at Prestonpans in Sept. 1745 as lieutenant colonel of the 44th Regiment, then commanded by Col. John Lee. Halkett was one of several officers captured in that British defeat. He was soon released on parole, the terms of which he scrupulously observed despite some apparent pressure from the duke of Cumberland to violate them.</p>

   <p>Braddock divided his army into two brigades for marching and camping on the road to Fort Duquesne. The first brigade, commanded by Sir Peter Halkett, consisted of the 44th Regiment, the two New York independent companies, three companies of Virginia provincials, and one of Maryland provincials. The second brigade, under Col. Thomas Dunbar, included the 48th Regiment, the South Carolina Independent Company, one company of North Carolina provincials, and four companies of Virginia provincials. Braddock realized that this arrangement was not the best for the initial departure from Fort Cumberland, as it would be impossible for the whole line with the baggage to move off the ground in one day. He therefore ordered the main army to march in three divisions to the first camp west of the fort, each division to leave on a different day (Captain Ormes Journal, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Winthrop Sargent, ed. &lt;i&gt;The History of an Expedition against Fort Du Quesne, in 1755; under Major-General Edward Braddock, Generalissimo of H.B.M. Forces in America&lt;/i&gt;. Philadelphia, 1856. ]">Sargent, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Braddocks Expedition</span></span>, 322). It was the first of these divisions, composed of the 44th Regiment and about 100 wagons loaded with provisions, stores, and powder, that Sir Peter Halkett led from the fort on 7 June.</p>

   <p>Horatio Gates (17281806), who later gained fame as a major general in the Continental Army during the American Revolution, was from 1754 to 1759 captain of one of the four New York independent companies. Born in England, he entered the British army at an early age. Between 1749 and 1754 he served in Nova Scotia, first as a lieutenant attached as an aide to the colonys governor and later as a captain lieutenant in the 45th Regiment of Foot. Returning to England, he purchased the captaincy of a New York independent company in Sept. 1754. He joined his new command at New York City the following March in time to take it south for Braddocks expedition. Gatess company, which consisted of 5 officers and about 90 men, had arrived on the Potomac by 28 April 1755. After that time Braddock temporarily stationed it at the mouth of the Conococheague to help forward stores, ammunition, and provisions to Fort Cumberland. The company itself finally reached the fort on 19 May. At the Battle of the Monongahela on 9 July 1755, Gates, apparently with the vanguard of the army, received a wound in the chest from which he was several weeks recovering.</p>

   <p>Ralph Burton (d. 1768) arranged in the fall of 1754 to join Braddocks expedition by exchanging his majority in the 2d Troop of Horse Grenadier Guards for the lieutenant colonelcy of the 48th Regiment, a commission of about equal value on the market for purchased commissions. A man of good sense, and an excellent officer in the opinion of his contemporaries, Burton went on to have a distinguished military career in North America. He rose to the rank of major general in 1762 and was named in 1764 commander in chief of all forces in the province of Quebec and the upper Great Lakes (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Daniel Dulany.

He returned to his native Yorkshire in 1766.</p>

   <p>Braddock on 7 June ordered Burton to march this second division of the army from Fort Cumberland on the morning of 8 June, but the departure was delayed until the next day. Six provincial companies in all marched with Burton.</p>

   <p>Dunbar and the third division of the army, which consisted of the 48th Regiment, the remaining provision wagons, and the packhorses, began marching from Fort Cumberland on the morning of 10 June. Braddock, accompanied by his aides-de-camp and Capt. Robert Stewarts troop of light horse, departed that afternoon and apparently arrived at Spendelows Camp with Dunbars division by nightfall.</p>

   <p>The Council of War, which consisted of Braddock and the six field officers of the 44th and 48th regiments, convened, according to Robert Orme, on 11 June, and the general meeting of all the officers occurred at Braddocks tent about 11 <span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">A.M.</span> that same day. The council made only a moderate reduction in the long line of wagons and artillery pieces with which the army was encumbered. It was agreed, reported Orme, to send back [to Fort Cumberland] two six-pounders, four cohorns, some powder and stores, which cleared near twenty waggons. All the Kings waggons [apparently 16 that had come
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0298">[298]</span>
from England with the artillery train] were also sent back to the Fort, they being too heavy, and requiring large horses for the shafts, which could not be procured; and country waggons were fitted for the powder in their stead. The most effective step taken to increase the mobility of the army was the councils decision to lighten the loads of the provision and ammunition wagons from 1820 to 1214 hundredweight each. The armys horses had proven to be both too few and too weak in general to pull the more heavily laden wagons with much efficiency even over Spendelows road, which was, as Lieutenant Colonel Burton reminded Braddock, a better road than could be expected in the coming days (Captain Ormes Journal, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Winthrop Sargent, ed. &lt;i&gt;The History of an Expedition against Fort Du Quesne, in 1755; under Major-General Edward Braddock, Generalissimo of H.B.M. Forces in America&lt;/i&gt;. Philadelphia, 1856. ]">Sargent, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Braddocks Expedition</span></span>, 33132). The wagonloads were to be reduced by transferring a large part of the provisionsmostly flour and baconto packhorses and redistributing the remaining provisions and ammunition among the wagons. It was to obtain the extra packhorses required as well as additional wagon horses that Braddock appealed to the officers to send all but their most essential baggage back to Fort Cumberland and give up the animals thereby freed for public service. Braddock promised to commend each cooperating officer to the king by name. He set a personal example by contributing with his military family 20 horses. GW gave up one of his horses, but apparently not until several days later. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-01-02-0160" class="document">GW to John Augustine Washington, 28 June2 July 1755</a>. In all about 100 horses were acquired from the officers, and the remainder of 11 June and all of the next day were used to rearrange loads and horses. For GWs support of the use of packhorses, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-01-02-0156" class="document">GW to John Augustine Washington, 14 June 1755</a>.</p>
