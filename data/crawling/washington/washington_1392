<div class="docbody">
<p style="text-indent: 0;">To The President</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 0;"><span style="float: left;">Honble Sir</span><span style="float: right;">Ft L[oudou]n the 4[10]th May, 1758.</span></p>  
<p style="clear: both;">The enclosed letter from Capt. Waggener, will inform your Honor of a very unfortunate affair. From the best accounts I have yet been able to get, there are about 60 persons killed and missing.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> Immediately upon receiving this Intelligence, I sent out a Detachment of the Regiment, and some Indians that were equipped for war, in hopes of their being able to intercept the Enemy in their retreat. I was fearful of this stroke, [(]but not time enough to avert it) as your Honor will find by the following account which came to hand just before Capt. Waggeners letter, by Captn McKenzie.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0002-ptr">2</a></p>
<p>Lieutenent Gist with 6 Soldiers and 30 Indians marched the 2d of April from the South-Branch; and after a tedious march (occasioned by the deep snows on the mountains) got on the waters of the monongahela, where Mr Gist was lamed by a fall from a steep bank, and rendered incapable of marching. The white people and some of the Indians remained with him; and the rest of the indians divided themselves into three parties, &amp; separated. Ucahula and two more went down the monongahela in a bark-canoe and landed near Ft du Quesne, on the no. side, where they lay concealed for two days; at length an opportunity offered of attacking a canoe, in which were two french-men fishing; those they killed and scalped in sight of two other canoes with french men in them, and came off safe.</p>
<p>When he got about 15 miles on this side Ft du Quesne, he came upon a large indian Encampment; from the size of which, and the number of tracks, judged to be at least 1,00, making directly for the frontiers of Virginia; as they again discovered, by crossing their tracks.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0003-ptr">3</a></p>
<p>At present I have nothing more to add to your Honor, having written several times lately on matters, to which I have received no answer.</p>
<span class="pb center" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-05-02-pb-0157">[157]</span>
<p>I had wrote thus far, and was going to send off an Express with this melancholy account, when I received advice, that the Particulars relative to those murders had been transmitted from Augusta, to your Honor:<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> I thereupon thought it most advisable to postpone sending, till I should receive answer to my several letters by Jenkins and Mr Gist;<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0005" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> which I was accordingly honored with, the 7th and last night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">May 10th</p>
<p>After due deliberation on your Honors letter of the 2d by Gist;<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0006" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0006-ptr">6</a> I am of opinion, that the number of Militia you have ordered for the defence of the Posts, to be evacuated by the Regiment, will be sufficient, unless the completing the works at this place should be thought necessary: As it can not be supposed, that the Enemy will attempt any formidable inception after the march of our army; and as to the depradations to be feared from their small scalping-parties, it would be out of the power of thrice the proposed number (or indeed of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">any</span> number) effectually to prevent them. But, as you are pleased to desire my opinionI beg leave to offer a few things relative to the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">disposition</span> you propose.</p>
<p>I humbly conceive, therefore, that it woud be infinitely more for the interest of the service, to order the 1,00 from Prince-William to the south-branch, and continuing Rutherfords company in its present station, making this its Head-Quarters. For, as that compy is perfectly acquainted with all that range of mountains, extending from the Potomack to the Augusta Line; and thro which the Enemy make incursions into this settlement; <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">they</span> could, with greater facility obstruct their inroads, and assist the Inhabitants of this valley (of whom they themselves form a very great part) than those who are ignorant of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Ground</span>. The Militia from Prince-William, equally know the Branch and this vicinity, and therefore may be supposed to do as much there, as here; Whereas moving Rutherfords <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">there</span>, would be stripping them of those essential advantages which they may derive from their thorough knowledge of these parts, &amp; removing them from defending their immediate Rights (the sole motive of their enlisting.) One half of this company, were it continued here, might be constantly ranging, and the other left in this fort, which is centrical to their present Station.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0007" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0007-ptr">7</a></p>
<p>If the works here are to be completed, which from their great
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-05-02-pb-0158">[158]</span>
importance I should think highly necessaryin that event, an additional number of 60 or 80 good men from the militia, for that particular service, would be wanted; and I do not know any person so capable of directing the works as Major Joseph Stephen, of Carolina-County. He formerly had the over-looking of them, and managed with remarkable Industry.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0008" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0008-ptr">8</a></p>
<p>A part of the Militia ordered for the Branch, should take post at Edwardss (on Cacapehon) and at Pearsalls, for the security of convoys passing from hence to Fort Cumberland.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0009" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0009-ptr">9</a></p>
<p>I really do not know what method can be practised to compel the Country-people to deliver up the public arms; unless there coud be a general search in every County. Governor Dinwiddie, if I remember right, issued two or three proclamations ordering them in, to no purpose.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0010" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0010-ptr">10</a></p>
<p>With regard to opening the Roads, I think it would be most advisable to postpone all attempts, till Sir Jno. St Clairs arrival, as he is expected so soon. For Pearsalls, altho it is the most convenient road for the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Virginia</span>, may not be used by the northern Troops; as I understand their Rendezvous is ordered at Fort Frederick in marylandThis may also (altho I can not yet absolutely say) render Garrisons at Edwards and Pearsalls, uselessunless it be a few to preserve the Forts, and the families gathered into them.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0011" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0011-ptr">11</a></p>
<p>As several of our best Sergeants were made Officers in the Carolina Regiment (besides some other vacancies in that Rank) parting with 10 for the use of the new Regiment, will be a very great hardship at this juncture.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0012" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0012-ptr">12</a> We are likewise short of our number of Drummers; and many of those we have, are <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">raw</span> and untutored. As the General expects not regularity from the new Levies, well knowing how little any attempts towards <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">it</span>, in a short time, would avail; I can not help being surprized at their requesting your Honor to give directions for doing what would be of no real service to the new Regiment, and would be of vast prejudice to that I have the honor to command.</p>
<p>In consequence of your Orders for completing the Regiment (with all possible dispatch) by Recruiting; I sometime ago sent all the officers I could spare to those parts of the Country where there is the greatest probability of success, and furnished them with all the money I had, and directions to draw upon me for whatever sum they might want for that Service.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0013" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0013-ptr">13</a> I likewise engaged
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-05-02-pb-0159">[159]</span>
some of the most popular of the Country Gentlemen to recruit for me, giving them the same liberty, to draw upon me, well knowing the difficulty of getting any tolerable number in a short time. I exerted myself in prosecuting every measure that afforded a prospect of success, having then, not the least reason to doubt of being duly supplied with money: But how great is my surprize at that paragraph of your Honors letter, that you can not send me <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">any</span> for that Service. As I had immediate demands upon me, which I put off until Mr Gists arrival, I consulted with my officers about applying the 4,00 sent for contingencies, towards these demands; and enclose you their opinion on that head:<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0014" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0014-ptr">14</a> and I must earnestly request, that you will be pleased to fall upon some measures of sending me 8,00 or 1,000 more; as your honor, the honor of the Colony, as well as mine and the Officers, together with that of those Gentlemen above-mentioned, who I have employed, is so nearly and immediately interested in the completion of those Engagements, which I have, in consequence of your Orders entered into. Surely it can not be imagined that I can pay the money (if I had it to deposit) out of my own private fortune; nor does the shortness of the time, nor the circumstances I am under, admit of any other alternative.</p>
<p>I will chearfully bespeak, and can easily procure, the Stage-Horses you desirewhen furnished with money for that purpose.</p>
<p>As Jno. Berry was made a Soldier [(]how legally, the Court of Officers, &amp;c. that sent him, can better declare) I must think it not only repugnant to Law but to the articles of war, and the customs of the army, to allow him to enlist in any other Corps; for, by this means, if there were no other bad consequences attending it, he defrauds the Country of double Bounty-money.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0015" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0120-fn-0015-ptr">15</a></p>
<p>I shall make a prudent use of the Power you have been pleased to give me, respecting the issuing Orders to the parties of Militia.</p>
<p>Your favor of the 3d by Mr French Mason, I have just been presented with: and would gladly have appointed him Ensign in the Regiment, had not the vacancies been disposed of, in the following manner, before <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">it</span> came to handvizt</p>

   <p>In his letter to St. Clair of 4 May GW adds information about parties of Indians having fallen upon the back Inhabitants of Augusta County and destroyd near 50 persons besides an Officer &amp; 18 Men of Captn Hogs Rangg Company. The Virginia council at its meeting of 19 May read two Letters from Capt. Hog in Augusta, the one of the 7th of April, giving an Account of two Forts in that County being destroyed by the Enemy, and the third Part of his Company cut off (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ H.

Journals of Virginia Council</span></span>, 6:9193). The forts captured and burned were the Upper Tract fort on the upper reaches of the South Branch and Fort Seybert, a short distance away on the South Fork of the South Branch. The Preston Register reports on 27 April the slaying of Capt. James Dunlop and twenty-two others at the Upper Tract, and, on the following day at Fort Seybert, the killing of Capt. Jacob Seybert (Siebert) and sixteen others and the capture of twenty-four. Dunlop, a militia captain, was also a lieutenant in Peter Hogs ranger company.</p>

   <p>The (missing) letter from Thomas Waggener that GW enclosed was clearly one that Waggener wrote after <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-05-02-0113" class="document">his letter to GW of 30 April</a>, which Robert McKenzie also apparently brought to Winchester.</p>

   <p>Nathaniel Gist, the second son of Capt. Christopher Gist, became a lieutenant at the end of 1755 in his fathers company of scouts, which was attached to GWs regiment, and he remained in the Virginia Regiment after the scouts were disbanded in 1757. Ucahula (Ocayula) was a son of the Cherokee emperor Old Hop. <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-05-02-0119" class="document">GWs letter to John St. Clair of 4 May</a> seems to suggest that GW got this account from Ucahula himself.</p>

   <p>James Duncanson, who served as a volunteer in the Virginia Regiment until he was made an ensign in Capt.

In any case, he was at this time in Augusta with Andrew Lewis, and he was killed in James Grants raid in September 1758 when Andrew Lewis was captured. John McCulley, a member of the Virginia forces since 1754 and a protg of Andrew Lewis with whom he was now serving, was a longtime and well-regarded sergeant in the Virginia Regiment (see the recommendation that he be promoted made <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-05-02-0006" class="document">to GW, 10 Oct. 1757, by Thomas Bullitt et al.</a>). John Sallard came in September 1755 from Richmond County with the recommendation of Landon Carter to join the Virginia Regiment. He was a sergeant in 1756 and a lieutenant in 1762 before the Regiment was disbanded.</p>
