The presence of the introductory paragraph indicates that GW did not deliver his address from the Pendleton document. However, the insertion of a phrase in GWs writing (see note 5 below) suggests that he subsequently reviewed the document and corrected it to read as he thought it should.</p>

   <p>John Hancock (17371793) of Massachusetts was elected president of the Second Continental Congress on 24 May 1775 in place of Peyton Randolph, who, as speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses, felt obligated to return to Virginia to attend the June session of the Burgesses. Hancock served as president of Congress until 29 Oct. 1777.</p>

   <p>The only known account of Congresss debate on GWs appointment as commander in chief is given by John Adams in his autobiography. Speaking to the committee of the whole sometime before 15 June, Adams moved that Congress adopt the army outside Boston and appoint a general to command it. He then added that though this was not the proper time to nominate a
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-03-01-02-pb-0002">[2]</span>
General, yet as I had reason to believe this was a point of the greatest difficulty, I had no hesitation to declare that I had but one Gentleman in my Mind for that important command, and that was a Gentleman from Virginia who was among Us and very well known to all of Us, a Gentleman whose Skill and Experience as an Officer, whose independent fortune, great Talents and excellent universal Character, would command the Approbation of all America, and unite the cordial Exertions of all the Colonies better than any other Person in the Union. Mr. Washington, who happened to sit near the Door, as soon as he heard me allude to him, from his Usual Modesty darted into the Library Room. . . . The Subject came under debate and several Gentlemen declared themselves against the Appointment of Mr. Washington, not on Account of any personal Objection against him: but because the Army was all from New England, had a General of their own [Artemas Ward], appeared to be satisfied with him and had proved themselves able to imprison the British Army in Boston, which was all they expected or desired at that time. Mr. [Edmund] Pendleton of Virginia [and] Mr. [Roger] Sherman of Connecticutt were very explicit in declaring this Opinion, Mr. [Thomas] Cushing and several others more faintly expressed their Opposition and their fears of discontent in the Army and in New England. Mr. [Robert Treat] Paine expressed a great Opinion of General Ward and a strong friendship for him, having been his Classmate at [Harvard] Colledge, or at least his contemporary: but gave no Opinion upon the question. The Subject was postponed to a future day. In the mean time, pains were taken out of doors to obtain a Unanimity, and the Voices were generally so clearly in favour of Washington that the dissentient Members were persuaded to withdraw their Opposition, and Mr. Washington was nominated, I believe by Mr. Thomas Johnson of Maryland, unanimously elected, and the Army adopted (L. H. Butterfield et al., eds., <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ L. H.

   <p>The word doubt is struck from the main line, and the word consciousness is inserted above it in Pendletons writing.</p>

   <p>Many years later Dr. Benjamin Rush of Philadelphia wrote that shortly after GW was appointed commander in chief of the Continental forces, I saw Patrick Henry at his lodgings, who told me that General Washington had been with him, and informed him that he was unequal to the station in which his country had placed him, and then added with tears in his eyes Remember, Mr. Henry, what I now tell you: From the day I enter upon the command of the American armies, I date my fall, and the ruin of my reputation (George W. Corner, ed., <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">The Autobiography of Benjamin Rush</span> [Princeton, 1948], 113).</p>

   <p>Immediately before selecting GW as commander in chief on 15 June, Congress resolved that the general who commanded the Continental forces have five hundred dollars, per month, . . . for his pay and expences (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington Chauncey Ford et al., eds. &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789&lt;/i&gt;. 34 vols.

  wrote to Elbridge Gerry on 18 June. A Gentleman, of one of the first Fortunes, upon the Continent, leaving his delicious Retirement, his Family and Friends, Sacrificing his Ease, and hazarding all in the Cause of his Country. His Views are noble and disinterested. He declared when he accepted the mighty Trust, that he would lay before Us, an exact account of his Expences, and not accept a shilling for Pay (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Washington University, St. Louis, Mo. ]">MoSW</span>). Eliphalet Dyer of Connecticut was equally impressed with GWs character, but he expressed some concern about the cost of the generals anticipated expenses. He is Clever, &amp; if any thing too modest, Dyer observed in a letter of 17 June to Joseph Trumbull. He seems discret &amp; Virtuous, no harum Starum ranting Swearing fellow but Sober, steady, &amp; Calm. His modesty will Induce him I dare say to take &amp; order every step with the best advice possible to be obtained in the Army. His allowance for Wages [for his staff] expences &amp; every thing is we think very high, not less than  150 lawll per month, but it was urged that the largeness of his family, Aide Camps, Secretary Servts &amp;c, beside a Constant table for more or less of his officers, daily expresses, dispatches &amp;c Must be very expensive (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Paul H.
