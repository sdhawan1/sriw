<p>Your obliging favours of the 28th Ulto &amp; 1st Instt are now before me, &amp; claim my particular thanks for the polite attention you pay to my wishes, in an early, &amp; regular Communication of what is passing in your Quarter.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0001" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0001-ptr">1</a></p>
<p>If my dear Sir, you conceive that I took any thing wrong, or amiss, that was conveyed in any of your former Letters you are really mistakenI only meant to convince you, that nothing would give me more real satisfaction than to know the Sentiments which are entertaind of me by the Publick, whether they be favourable, or otherwiseand, urged as a reason that the Man who wished to steer clear of Shelves &amp; Rocks must know where they layI knowbut to declare it unless to a friend, may be an argument of vanitythe Integrety of my own HeartI know the unhappy predicament I stand in. I know, that much is expected of meI know that without Men, without Arms, without Ammunition, without any thing fit for the accomodation of a Soldier that little is to be doneand, which is
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-03-03-02-pb-0287">[287]</span>
mortifying; I know, that I cannot stand justified to the World without exposing my own Weakness &amp; injuring the cause by declaring my wants, which I am determined not to do further than unavoidable necessity brings every Man acquainted with themIf under these disadvantages I am able to keep above Water (as it were) in the esteem of Mankind I shall feel myself happy; but, if from the unknown, peculiarity of my Circumstances, I suffer in the opinion of the World I shall not think you take the freedom of a friend if you conceal the reflections that may be cast upon my conduct. My own Situation feels so irksome to me at times, that, if I did not consult the publick good more than my own tranquility I should long ere this have put every thing to the cast of a DyeSo far from my having an Army of 20,000 Men well Armd &amp;ca I have been here with less than one half of it, including Sick, furloughd, &amp; on Command, and those neither Armd or Cloathed, as they should be.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0002" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> In short my Situation has been such that I have been obligd to use art to conceal it from my own Officers.</p>
<p>The Congress as you observe, expect I believe, that I should do more than others; for whilst they compel me to Inlist men without a bounty they give 40/ to others;<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0003" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> which will, I expect, put a stand to our Inlistments, for notwithstanding all the publick virtue which is ascribd to these people, there is no nation under the Sun (that I ever came across) pay greater adoration to money than they doI am pleasd to find, that your Battalions are Cloathed and look well, and that they are filing of for CanadaI wish I could say that the Troops here had altered much in Dress or appearanceOur Regiments are little more than half compleat &amp; Recruiting nearly at a standIn all my Letters I fail not the mention of Tents &amp; now perceive that notice is taken of the Appli[catio]n.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0004" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0004-ptr">4</a></p>
<p>I have been convinced by General Howes conduct that he has either been very ignorant of our Situation (which I do not believe) or, that he has received positive Orders (wch I think is natural to conclude) not to put any thing to the hazard till his reinforcements arriveotherwise, there has [not] been a time since the first of December that we must have fought like men to have maintaind these Lines, so great in their extentThe Party to Bunkers Hill had some good, &amp; some bad Men engaged in itOne or two Courts have been held on the Conduct

of part of itto be plain, these Peopleamong friendsare not to be depended upon if exposedand any Man will fight well if he thinks himself in no dangerI do not apply this to these PeopleI suppose it to be the case with all raw, &amp; undisciplined Troops.</p>
<p>You may rely upon it, that Transports left Boston Six Weeks ago with Troops. where they are gone to (unless drove to the West Indias) I know notyou may also rely upon General Clintons Sailing from Boston about 3 Weeks ago with about four or five hundred Menhis destination I am also a stranger to.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0005" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> I am sorry to hear of the failures you speak of from France, but why will not Congress forward part of the Powder made in your provence? they seem to look upon this as the Season for Action, but will not furnish the meansbut, I will not blame themI dare say the demands upon them are greater than they can supplythe cause must be starved till our resources are greater, or more certain within ourselves.</p>
<p>With respect to myself, I have never entertaind an Idea of an Accomodation since I heard of the Measures which were adopted in consequence of the Bunkers Hill fight. The Kings Speech has confirmd the Sentiments I entertaind upon the News of that Affair<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0006" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0006-ptr">6</a>and, if every Man was of my Mind the Ministers of G. B. should know, in a few Words, upon what Issue the cause should be put. I would not be deceived by artful declarations, or specious pretencesnor would I be amused by unmeaning propositions. but in open, undisguised, and Manly terms proclaim our Wrongs &amp; our Resolutions to be redressed. I would tell them, that we had born muchthat we had long, &amp; ardently sought for reconciliation upon honourable termsthat it had been denied usthat all our attempts after Peace had provd abortive and had been grossly misrepresentedthat we had done every thing that could be expected from the best of Subjectsthat the Spirit of Freedom beat too high in us, to Submit to Slavery; &amp; that, if nothing else would satisfie a Tyrant &amp; his diabolical Ministry, we were determined to shake of all Connexions with a State So unjust, &amp; unnatural. This I would tell them, not under Covert, but in Words as clear as the Sun in its Meridian brightness.</p>

Corner Heros. I am glad their zeal is in some measure abated because if Circumstances will not permit us to make an Attempt upon B[oston] or if it Should be made and fail, we shall not appear altogether so culpableI entertain the same opinion of the attempt now which I have ever done. I believe an Assault will be attended with considerable loss. and I believe it wd Succeed, if the Men should behave wellwithout it, unless there is equal bad behaviour on the other side, we cannotAs to an Attack upon B Hill (unless it could be carried by surprize) the loss, I conceive, would be greater in proportion than at Boston and if a defeat should follow would be discouraging to the Men, but highly animating if crownd with Success. great good, or great evil, would consequently result from it. it is quite a different thing to what you left, being by odds the strongest Fortress they possess, both in Rear and Front.</p>
<p>The Congress having ordered all Captures to be tried in the Courts of Admiralty of the different Governments to which they are sent&amp; some irreconcaleable difference arising between the Resolves of Congress, &amp; the Law of this Colony respecting the preceedings, or something or another, which always happens to procrastinate business here has put a total stop to the tryals to the no small injury of the publick as well as great grievance of Individuals whenever a condemnation shall take place I shall not be unmindful of your advice respecting the Hulls &amp;ca.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0007" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0209-fn-0007-ptr">7</a></p>
<p>Would to Heaven the Plan you Speak of for obtaining Arms may succeedthe acquisition would be great and give fresh life &amp; vigour to our measures as would the arrival you speak of; Our expectations are kept alive, and if we can keep ourselves so and spirits up another Summer I have no fears of wanting the needful after that.</p>
<p>As the number of our Inlisted Men were too small to undertake any offensive Operation if the Circumstances of Weather &amp;ca should favour I ordered in (by Application to this Govt Connecticut, &amp; New Hampshire) as many Regiments of Militia as would enable us to attempt something, in some manner or otherthey were to have been here by the first of the Month. but only a few stragling Companies are yet come in.

   <p>Commodore John Manleys armed schooner <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Harrison</span> was pursued by the British armed brig <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Hope</span> commanded by Capt. George Dawson. The <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">New-England Chronicle: or, the Essex Gazette</span> (Cambridge, Mass.) for 8 Feb. 1776 reported that as Capt. Manly was coming out of Plymouth, January 30, an armed brig (which went from Boston for the purpose of taking him, as is supposed) gave him chace; upon which he ran his vessel on shore, a little South of the North river in Scituate. The brig came to anchor, and fired not less than 400 times upon the privateer; but, very remarkably, no man was even wounded. One ball entered the stern, and passed but about six inches from Capt. Manly, who was confined by sickness in his cabin. The next day, 130 balls were found upon the adjacent shore. Having run ashore at low tide, the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Hancock</span> floated free at high tide on the evening of 30 Jan. and sailed into the North River where she again ran aground. Manley then abandoned the vessel and with the help of local militiamen built and manned a breastwork on the nearby shore. When a party from the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Hope</span> boarded the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Hancock</span> on the morning of 31 Jan. and attempted to burn her, it was soon driven off by firing from Manleys breastwork. Saved from destruction, the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Hancock</span> was floated two days later and moved to Scituate for refitting.</p>
