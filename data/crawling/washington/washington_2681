   <p>Poseys letter of April has not been found. Posey indicates below that GW had helped secure a job for young John Price Posey at Thomas Lawsons Neabsco ironworks in Prince William County. Mr Haul is probably Jonathan Hall who at this time was in business in Alexandria with George Gilpin (17401813).</p>

   <p>GWs letter of 20 Jan. has not been found. For the suit by John West, Jr., to recover from Posey the 6acre tract on the Potomac at Mount Vernon where Posey lived and operated his ferry, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-08-02-0136&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-08-02-0136-fn-0002#GEWN-02-08-02-0136-fn-0002" class="document">John West, Jr., to GW, 26 April 1769, n.2</a>. Poseys lawyer is Robert Hanson Harrison.</p>

   <p>At the time of the public sale of Poseys assets in October 1769, Hector Ross of Colchester was one of Poseys largest creditors. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-08-02-0175&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-08-02-0175-fn-0001#GEWN-02-08-02-0175-fn-0001" class="document">GW to Robert Hanson Harrison, 7 Oct. 1769, n.1</a>.</p>

   <p>The assets of Poseys second wife, Elizabeth Adair Posey, who died in late 1769, had proved insufficient to meet the claims against her estate, and the five slaves that Posey had posted to secure his bond did not cover the deficit. As Posey indicates here, Thomas Ringgold (17151772) of Kent County, Md., a well-to-do and well-connected land speculator and merchant in Chestertown, was pressing him as the holder of Poseys bond. Negro Jack, probably a ferryman, was in the hire of GW from 23 April to 17 Nov. 1770, for which Posey charged GW 6.14 (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Manuscript Ledger Book 1, 1750-72, in George Washington Papers, Library of Congress. ]">Ledger A</span>, 256).</p>

   <p>For the disputed 6acre tract of land and GWs eventual purchase of it, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-08-02-0136&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-08-02-0136-fn-0002#GEWN-02-08-02-0136-fn-0002" class="document">John West, Jr., to GW, 26 April 1769, n.2</a>. GW sent 12 to Posey by your Son Price in July 1771. He had the previous year sent sixteen shillings, Virginia currency, to Poseys son Hanson, pr his order on 11 April 1770 when Posey was at Annapolis (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Manuscript Ledger Book 1, 1750-72, in George Washington Papers, Library of Congress. ]">Ledger A</span>, 256). Poseys plea for assistance with the education of his son St. Lawrence was answered by GW. While Posey was in jail in Queenstown, Francis Baker took pity on the child and took him into his house. Baker sent St. Lawrence to the Queen Annes County free school with his own children. Later this year, after Poseys release from prison and return to Virginia, William Minor presented Baker with an order from John Posey for custody of the child and put him to work in his Queenstown tavern until Posey himself rescued the boy a few months later. GW reimbursed Baker for the money he had spent on St. Lawrences behalf and provided more money for the boys education as late as 5 Nov. 1774, when he paid 17, Maryland currency, to John Price Posey in discharge of his Fathers ordr for Board &amp; Schooling of Lawrence Posey.
