   <p>Valentine Crawford (d. 1777) lived on Jacobs Creek in western Pennsylvania, several miles north of Stewarts Crossing on the Youghiogheny River (now the site of Connellsville, Pa.), where his brother William Crawford (17321782) had settled. Both men were deeply involved in GWs efforts to acquire large holdings of land west of the Allegheny Mountains. During the late 1760s and early 1770s, William Crawford surveyed a number of tracts for GW, including one on the Youghiogheny, one near Chartiers Creek, and several along the Kanawha and Ohio rivers. To preserve his titles to those Kanawha and Ohio lands, GW engaged Valentine Crawford in the spring of 1774 to take a party of workers down the Ohio and seat his tracts by building houses and cultivating fields as required by Virginia law (3 <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William Waller Hening, ed. &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia, from the First Session of the Legislature, in the Year 1619&lt;/i&gt;. 13 vols. 181923. Reprint. Charlottesville, Va., 1969. ]">Hening</span> 31213). That expedition was canceled before it started because of the outbreak of Dunmores War.</p>

   <p>On 10 Jan. 1775 GW hired James Cleveland of Loudoun County, Va., to do what Valentine Crawford had been prevented from doing the previous year: lead an expedition down the Ohio to improve his Ohio and Kanawha lands. Cleveland reached GWs tract near the mouth of the Kanawha in late April, but his work went slowly. He described his difficulties, in particular the problem of the runaway indentured servants, to GW in letters of <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-10-02-0278" class="document">12</a> and <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-10-02-0280" class="document">21 May</a> and <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-10-02-0283" class="document">7 June 1775</a>. The five runaways who tried to escape to the Shawnee town on the Muskingum River were caught, but one man ran off again before he could be brought back to Clevelands camp. Cleveland did not think it worth the time to try to recapture him. Of the four servants who were returned, Cleveland considered three to be poor workers, and apparently they were the ones sold. The Indian trader who assisted Cleveland in recovering the runaways was David Duncan of Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. During the latter part of the Revolution, Duncan moved his home to western Pennsylvania and served as deputy quartermaster general at Fort Pitt. Fort Pitt was called Fort Dunmore by Virginians during 1774 and 1775 in honor of their royal governor, John Murray, fourth earl of Dunmore. Gilbert Simpson, Jr., with whom Cleveland left three barrels of corn, was GWs manager at Washingtons Bottom, the tract of land that GW owned on the Youghiogheny River at the site of present-day Perryopolis, Pennsylvania. For Clevelands account of the canoe that sank on the way down the Ohio, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-10-02-0278" class="document">Cleveland to GW, 12 May 1775</a>. James McCormick (died c.1789) of Berkeley County, Va. (now W.Va.), served as a soldier under GW during the Fort Necessity campaign in 1754. Charles Morgan became GWs rent collector in western Pennsylvania in 1794.</p>

   <p>Dr. James Craik (17301814) of Port Tobacco, Md., a close friend of GW, was granted several thousand acres of land on the Ohio and Kanawha rivers for his service as a surgeon during the Fort Necessity campaign. He was

   <p>Jurisdiction over the area around the Forks of the Ohio had long been contested between Virginia and Pennsylvania, and by 1775 the two colonies had established rival local governments in the region. Virginia included the disputed territory within the boundaries of its District of West Augusta, and in February 1775 a court for West Augusta was convened at Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania considered the area to be part of its Westmoreland County, whose court sat at Hannastown, about thirty miles east of Pittsburgh. Dr. John Connolly (c.17431813), a physician and land speculator, was Governor Dunmores chief representative at Pittsburgh despite the fact that Connolly was a native Pennsylvanian. Appointed commandant of militia at Pittsburgh by Dunmore, Connolly took possession of the abandoned Fort Pitt in January 1774, renamed it Fort Dunmore, and summoned the local inhabitants to form a militia under his command. His actions greatly angered Pennsylvanias adherents in the area, and there ensued a series of arrests and counterarrests by Virginia and Pennsylvania officials, of which the ones mentioned in this letter were only the latest. On 22 June 1775 the sheriff of Westmoreland County, John Carnaghan, arrived at Pittsburgh with a force of men, including Westmoreland justice George Wilson (d. 1777) of Georges Creek, and freed James Cavet and Robert Hanna, two Westmoreland justices whom Connolly had held under arrest since February. At the same time Carnaghan arrested Connolly and took him to the house of Arthur St. Clair, a Westmoreland justice and future Continental general, who lived at Fort Ligonier, about forty-five miles east of Pittsburgh. In reprisal for Carnaghans actions, a group of Connollys supporters from Chartiers Creek southwest of Pittsburgh, led by Capt. George Gibson, seized George Wilson and two other Westmoreland justices, Joseph Spear and Devereaux Smith, both Indian traders residing at Pittsburgh. Those three prisoners were sent to Fort Fincastle at Wheeling, which a Virginia force commanded by William Crawford had built the year before.</p>


   <p>The problems caused by these arrests were settled by the committees of safety for the two rival governments, both of which were chosen on 16 May 1775. The West Augusta committee included not only Virginia justices, such as William Crawford, but also two of the Pennsylvania justices who were seized in June, George Wilson and Devereaux Smith. John Connolly was not a member of the West Augusta committee, however. Because of his close ties to Governor Dunmore, he became a staunch Loyalist, and he was attempting at this time to organize support for the royal government on the western frontier. The West Augusta committee was particularly fearful that Connolly would use his considerable skills as an Indian negotiator to persuade the Indians living north of the Ohio to ally themselves with the king against his rebelling subjects, but they also found themselves in the embarrassing position of having to depend on Connolly to conduct a previously scheduled peace council with those Indians. At the conclusion of Dunmores War in October 1774, Governor Dunmore promised the defeated Indians that their hostages would be returned and a final peace made at Pittsburgh the next spring. Connolly was preparing to negotiate this peace under the watchful eyes of the members
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-03-01-02-pb-0032">[32]</span>
of the West Augusta committee when he was suddenly carried off by the Pennsylvanians, leaving the assembled chiefs puzzled and the committee members frustrated in their desire to placate the Indians. To remedy the unfortunate turn of events, the West Augusta committee not only persuaded the Westmoreland committee to return Connolly but also secured the release of the three Pennsylvania justices, whose seizure it condemned as illegal. Connolly conferred with the Indian chiefs at Pittsburgh on 29 June, and between 3 and 6 July he concluded a peace that satisfied the West Augusta committee, even though the Shawnee were absent. During the next several months Connolly vigorously pursued a scheme for raising a Loyalist force west of the Alleghenies. In November 1775 American authorities arrested Connolly and eventually imprisoned him at Philadelphia.
