   <p>The expedition to the Indian towns was planned by John Connolly and approved by Dunmore, not only to send troops to destroy the upper Shawnee towns on the Scioto and Muskingum rivers but also to build Fort Fincastle and Fort Gower at the mouths of Wheeling and Hockhocking creeks. Dunmore recommended William Crawford as a prudent, active, and resolute man (Dunmore to Connolly, 20 June 1774, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Pa. Archives</span>, ser. 1, 4:52223). Major Angus McDonald, however, did lead the attack on the Shawnee towns in late July and early August. Valentine Crawfords other brother was John Stephenson, who had settled near the Great Crossing of the Youghiogheny in 1768.</p>

   <p>The young John Knight purchased by William Crawford was probably the surgeons mate named John Knight (d. 1838) who was captured with William Crawford in the Sandusky campaign of 1782 and provided an eyewitness account of Crawfords torture and death at the stake.
