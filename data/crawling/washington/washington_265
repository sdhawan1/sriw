   <p>Thomas Cresaps fortified trading post at Shawnee Old Town was 15 or 20 miles overland from Fort Cumberland. Patterson, or Pattersons, Creek flowed into the upper reaches of the Potomac River from the Virginia side between Fort Cumberland and Cresaps; Town Creek emptied into the Potomac from Pennsylvania and Maryland a few miles downriver from the trading post.

   <p>John Fraser, whom GW first met at Turtle Creek on his mission to Fort Le Boeuf in 1753, was a gunsmith. In 1758 he served as Capt. of the Guides in the Forbes expedition (<a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-05-02-0211" class="document">Henry Bouquet to GW, 8 July 1758</a>). According to another letter on the same day, Jenny McClane, the Girl that lived with Fraser, was taken just by the Fort; the man that was with her had his Horse shot through, but carried him off (William Trent to James Burd, <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Colonial Records of Pennsylvania&lt;/i&gt;. 16 vols.

Adam Stephen, in a letter dated 22 Dec. 1756 to Governor Denny of Pennsylvania, referred to the woman as a woman who once belonged to John Fraser (his wife or mistress) and has now, after being prisoner with Shingas, &amp;c., thirteen months, made her escape from Muskingum (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Charles A.

   <p>Barnaby Currin was a Pennsylvania trader. In 1750 he had accompanied Christopher Gist on his explorations for the Ohio Company. Currin was also associated with George Croghan in the Indian trade and was one of the Servitors who accompanied GW on his journey to Fort Le Boeuf in 1753 (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig, eds. &lt;i&gt;The Diaries of George Washington&lt;/i&gt;. 6 vols.

   <p>Great Island, or Big Island, was on the West Branch of the Susquehanna River near present Lock Haven. It was located on trails leading directly to the Seneca country and to the Ohio and was a favorite stopping and meeting place for the Delaware, Shawnee, and Iroquois. There does not, however, seem to have been any permanent settlement there at this time. Monacatoocha wrote to Gov. Robert Hunter Morris on 11 Sept. that he was gathering a party of men to attack the French forts and, although there were only 23 there, more were coming every day. Andrew Montour was among those already present (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Colonial Records of Pennsylvania&lt;/i&gt;. 16 vols.

The proposed expedition evidently came to naught, probably because not enough men arrived. Winingo is Stephens rendering of Venango.</p>

   <p>In 1746, when the British proposed a joint British-American assault against the French at Montreal and Quebec, John Dagworthy, a storekeeper in Trenton, N.J., became a captain in Gov. William Goochs contingent of troops from the middle colonies. Unlike in the conflict that broke out in 1754 when the commissions of the colonial officers came from the colonial governors, Dagworthys captains commission was from the king, making him in effect an officer in the regular British army, but only for the duration of the expedition. When the expedition to Canada failed to materialize, the American troops in 1747 were disbanded. See William Shirleys proclamation, 2 June, Shirley to Benning Wentworth, 8 June, and to duke of Newcastle, 28 July 1746, all in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Charles Henry Lincoln, ed. &lt;i&gt;Correspondence of William Shirley: Governor of Massachusetts and Military Commander in America, 1731-1760&lt;/i&gt;. 2 vols.

It would seem that the disbanding of the American troops should have put an end to the matter, but Dagworthy used his captaincy in the aborted Canadian expedition to make his claim in the fall of 1755 that he outranked all officers at Fort Cumberland who held colonial commissions. Upon leaving Fort Cumberland on his march in June 1755, General Braddock made Col. James Innes, who held a regular commission, governor of the fort. Trouble did not begin until Innes went to North Carolina on personal business in September and indicated that the senior colonial officer present at the fort, Lt. Col. Adam Stephen of the Virginia forces, should act as commanding officer during his absence. It was at this point, according to Stephen, that Dagworthy began to insist that his earlier kings commission as a captain entitled him to take precedence over Lieutenant Colonel Stephen and to assume command of all the
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-02-02-pb-0075">[75]</span>
troops at Cumberland. Dagworthys claim was particularly galling to GW, who stayed away from the fort lest Dagworthy directly challenge his own authority. GW bitterly complained to Dinwiddie and ultimately got his permission to go to Boston in Feb. 1756 to get William Shirley to settle the matter, which he did more or less to GWs satisfaction in <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-02-02-0321" class="document">his Memorandum to GW of 5 Mar. 1756</a>.

   <p>Lieutenant Bacon was probably John Bacon, a lieutenant in Marylands Independent Company stationed at Fort Cumberland and commanded by Capt. John Dagworthy. Later this month GW ordered Bacon to supervise the building of forts on Patterson Creek in Virginia for the ranger companies commanded by William Cocks and John Ashby. On 8 April 1756 the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Maryland Gazette</span> (Annapolis) reported the rumor that Bacon had been killed by Indians about 4 miles from Fort Cumberland, and in a letter of 5 May 1756 to Cecilius Calvert, Governor Sharpe confirmed that Bacon was scalped as he was returning from Colo Cresaps to the Fort (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William Hand Browne, ed. &lt;i&gt;Correspondence of Governor Horatio Sharpe&lt;/i&gt;. 3 vols. &lt;i&gt;Archives of Maryland&lt;/i&gt;, vols. 6, 9, and 14.
