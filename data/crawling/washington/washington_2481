<p>I was some weeks out of Town for the benefit of my Health, which I seldom enjoy here, on my return to this place I had the immense pleasure to receive both your Affectionate and most acceptable Favors of the 5th August via Barbados and of the 1st Novemr under Cover from my Friend Mr Jameison from Norfolk breathing those Sentiments of real Friendship which I have on all occasions had the happiness to experience by which I think myself greatly hond and which I will ever deem one of the most happy and valueable acquisitions I made in Life,<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0123-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0123-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> the kind manner in which you are pleased to enter into my present situation and the fears you apprehend on my accot from the nature of this Climate at once evince the warmth of your regard and the rectitude of your opinion, which from a great variety of

instances in the course of that agreeable part of my Life in which I had the honor and very great satisfaction to Serve under your Orders I ever found supported by those powerfull reasons that are the certain marks of real Genius and a solid Judgement which seldom unite in one person; The Physician who I have chiefly employd in this Island (where I in general have been Sick and at best rather enjoy the absence of pain than good Health) has given it as his opinion that a perfect Recovery from my Bilious Disorder with which I am so much afflicted is not to be hoped for but in a Cold Climate, I have therefore resolved to embark for England the first good opporty after the vernal Equinox and tho. my Constitution is much injured I have hopes given me that my native air exercise and a proper Regimen will in time effect the re:establishment of my Health, the deprivation of which in a great measure destroys the relish of most other enjoymts, you see by my dwelling so long upon this disagreeable Subject how much an Invalid I amI sometime ago wrote for leave to appoint a Depy but should it not come in Time the Governor<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0123-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0123-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> can on such an emergency grant 12 Months leave of absence and for that time appoint a Depy who I hope to get confirmd in London in which event I can be able to save more from the part I shall receive than from the whole Emoluments of my Office if I continue in this very expensive &amp; to me disagreeable place, whenever I get my Affairs settled in London I propose to retire either to the Highlands of Scotland or to the South of France as the Physicians shall direct till I can recover my Health and get clear of the heavy Burthen my long and very expensive attendance unavoidably brought me under, this I hope to accomplish in about four years and then I flatter myself with the pleasing hope of passing the Eveng of my Life with some degree of independence &amp; comfort in that dear Country calld Old England which I must confess I would prefer to all othersI observe with the utmost Gratitude that you have Drawen only for the Principal of the Money you was generously Pleased to advance for me!<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0123-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0123-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> I really want words to convey the Ideas of what I feel on this N<span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">oble</span> A<span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ct</span> and fresh mark of your uncommon Friendship, I pray Heaven may one day or other enable me to demonstrate by actions what words can so imperfectly express in the mean time accept my dear Friend of my most Gratefull Thanks.</p>

<p>The accots you indulge me with of some of the Officers of the Virginia Regiment are very pleasing, I often think of that Corps who owd its distinguished Character to your Military Talents with uncommon satisfaction tho. blended with much regret from the situation of many of its brave Officers, who certainly have not been rewarded in any degree adequate to their Merit and uncommon Sufferings, I think without vanity we can assert that there never was and very probably never will be such another Provincial Regimt. I am truely glad that honest Weedon (for whom I have a great regard) is well and still maintains the same happy flow of Spirits and Joyous turn for which he was always remarkd<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-08-02-0123-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-08-02-0123-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> what is become of your Secretary Mr Kirkpatrick whose lively Conversation and very Elegant Letters have so often made me happy?

<p>I am astonishd how my Letters to you from London could have miscarried I generally sent Jack (your old Courier) who still lives with me to the Virginia Coffee House with them, for I very seldom went into the City which I hate, and Mercer can tell you how often I lamented the great misfortune of not hearing from you, tho by incessant enquires I frequently had the great pleasure to hear of you. To recapitulate the various Planns I formd to continue a Soldier and the infinite pains I took at different times to get into the Service of the East India Compy, of Portugal

In 1763 the Board of Trade received a request to rule on the legitimacy of Van Rensselaers claims, and in 1765 thirty reduced army officers asked that the lots of land they are entitled to under his Majestys proclamation of the 7th of October, 1763, may be located on the lands unwarrantably claimed by Van Renselaer (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Journal of the Commissioners for Trade and Plantations&lt;/i&gt;. 14 vols. 192038.

In 1767 the board instructed the governor of New York, Sir Henry Moore (17131769), to bring suit against Van Rensselaer on behalf of the officers, who should be granted 250,000 acres of the land claimed by Van Rensselaer (ibid., 12:365, 13:412).
