ProvincesComplaints are made by Some of them, that they are in want of bedding &amp; many other things; as I understand that Mr Franks has undertaken that business, I wish he was orderd to send a deputy immediatly, to See that the prisoners get what is allowed them by Congress, allso to Supply the Officers with money as they may have occasion, it will Save me much time &amp; much trouble.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0202-fn-0006" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0202-fn-0006-ptr">6</a></p>
<p>there are yet but few Companys of the Militia come in, this delay will, I am much affraid, frustrate the intention of their being Called uponas the Season is slipping fast away when they may be of Service.</p>
<p>the demands of the Army were So very pressing before your Last remittence Came to hand, that I was under the necessity of borrowing 25,000 Lawful money from this province, they very chearfully Lent it, &amp; passd a vote for as much more, if required, I have not repaid the Sum borrowed, as I may Stand in need of it, before the arrival of another Supply, which the demands of the Commissary General, Quartermaster General, &amp; paying off the arrearages, will very Soon require.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0202-fn-0007" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0202-fn-0007-ptr">7</a></p>
<p>Your esteemd favour of the 29th Ultimo is just Come to hand, it makes me very happy to find my Conduct, hath met the approbation of CongressI am entirely of your opinion, that Should an accommodation take place, the terms will be Severe or favorable, in proportion to our ability to resist, and that we ought to be on a respectable footing to receive their Armaments in the Springbut how far we shall be provided with the Means, is a Matter I profess not to Know, under my present unhappy want of, Arms, Ammunition, and I may add men, as our Regiments are very incomplete, the recruiting goes on very Slow, and will, I apprehend be more So, if for other Service the men receive a bounty, &amp; none is given here.</p>
<p>I have tried every Method I Coud think of to procure Arms for our men, they realy are not to be had in these Governments belonging to the Public<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0202-fn-0008" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0202-fn-0008-ptr">8</a> and if Some method is not fallen upon, in the Southern Governments to Supply us, We shall be in a distressd Situation for want of them, there are near 2000 men now in Camp, without firelocks, I have wrote to the Committee of Newyork this day, requesting them to send me those Arms, which were taken from the disaffected in that Government,<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0202-fn-0009" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0202-fn-0009-ptr">9</a> the Congress interesting themselves in this request, will

doubtless have a good effectI have Sent Officers into the Country with money to purchass Arms in the different towns, Some have returnd, &amp; brought in a few, many are Still out, what their Success will be, I cannot determine.</p>
<p>I was in great hopes, that the expresses Resolved to be establisd between this place &amp; Philadelphia woud ere now have been fixtit woud, in my opinion, rather Save, than increase the expence, as many horses are destroyed by one man Comeing the whole way, it will certainly be more expeditious, &amp; Safer than writeing by the post, or private hands, which I am often under the necessity of doing.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-03-03-02-0202-fn-0010" id="GEWN-03-03-02-0202-fn-0010-ptr">10</a> I am with great respect Sir Your most Ob.

   <p>Capt. Daniel Waters in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Lee</span> and Capt. Samuel Tucker in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Franklin</span> captured the brig <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Henry and Esther</span>, Captain Nellis, master, on 29 Jan. and brought her into Squam on the Cape Ann peninsula the following day. Winthrop Sargents letter to GW of 2 Feb. 1776 informing him of this capture has not been found. Two days later Moylan replied to Sargent instructing him to give the officers and crewmen their private property after Captain Nellis proved it on oath and to libel the vessel immediately. If the Harbour is unsafe, Moylan further directed, . . . remove her to a place more secure. If the Sailors will engage on Board any of our armed vessels for 12 months, they will be entitled to one months pay advance, but they must be dispersed so that many of them may not be on b[o]ard any one vessel (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>). Daniel Waters (17311816) of Malden, Mass., and Samuel Tucker (17471833) of Marblehead, Mass., became captains of armed vessels on 20 Jan. 1776 and served as such until the following January. Tucker moved from the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Franklin</span> to the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Hancock</span> in the spring of 1776, while Waters remained with the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Lee</span> throughout the year. On 15 Mar. 1777 Congress appointed both Waters and Tucker captains in the Continental navy. Tucker commanded the frigate <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Boston</span> until she was captured at Charleston in May 1780, and in January 1781 he became captain of a Massachusetts privateer which was captured at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River later that year. Waters was unable to obtain an immediate command in the Continental navy and served for a time during 1777 as a lieutenant under Capt. John Manley. In the summer of 1779 Waters participated in the ill-fated Penobscot expedition as captain of the ship <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">General Putnam</span>, which he was obliged to destroy to prevent its capture, and in 1781 he commanded a Massachusetts privateer. Eyre Massey (17191804),

colonel of the 27th (or Inniskilling) Regiment, arrived at Halifax with his regiment by 5 Dec. 1775. Given the rank of major general in America, Massey commanded the British forces in Nova Scotia for the next four years.</p>

   <p>GW requested the appointment of a commissary of prisoners in his <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-02-02-0304" class="document">letter to Hancock of 8 Nov. 1775</a>. On 1 Dec. 1775 Congress resolved that David Franks (17291794) of Philadelphia be permitted to supply provisions and other necessities to the British prisoners in Pennsylvania at the expense of the crown. Franks was also asked to undertake the same task for the prisoners of war held in the other colonies, but there is no evidence that he agreed to do so. On 16 May 1776 a committee recommended to Congress that a commissary of prisoners be appointed for each of the three military departments. That suggestion was recommitted to the committee, and not until 7 Oct. 1776 did Congress resolve that each state should appoint a commissary of prisoners (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington Chauncey Ford et al., eds. &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789&lt;/i&gt;. 34 vols.

Franks acted as a commissary of British prisoners until the fall of 1778 when he was relieved of his duties and arrested for conducting a treasonous correspondence (ibid., 12:1032). Franks was banished to

   <p>On 1 Feb. 1776 Congress discussed a report on the establishment of expresses between Philadelphia and Cambridge, but the delegates postponed action and instructed Postmaster General Benjamin Franklin to consult his deputies about the terms on which expresses could be obtained. The matter was not taken up again until June, and in July Congress ordered the postmaster general to establish expresses between Philadelphia and GWs New York headquarters (Richard Smiths Diary, 1 Feb. 1776, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Paul H.
