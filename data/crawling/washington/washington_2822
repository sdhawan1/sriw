   <p>The Custis plantation in Hanover County, a considerable distance from the other lands, was rented out.</p>

   <p>This is the earliest reference to the White House that has been found in the correspondence or Custis estate material. This Custis house in New Kent County was the home of Daniel Parke Custis before and during his marriage to Martha Dandridge. All of the correspondence, slave listings, and accounts of tobacco made at the Custis plantations in New Kent County list Rockahock, Brick House, Old Quarter, and Harlows as the four plantations. White House may have been a later name for one of the other plantations, probably Rockahock, or this may have been the name only of the house. No record of the rental of the White House has been found, and so the house may have been lived in by one of the overseers at this time.</p>

   <p>Old Nanney is probably the 50year-old slave by that name at the Brick House plantation.

   <p><a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-09-02-0055" class="document">Hill wrote GW on 24 July</a> that he had broken the partnership between Joseph Valentine and John Stratton. The copy of the agreement, in an unknown hand, that Hill enclosed reads: An Agreement made between Joseph Valentine and John Stratton that the aforesd Joseph Valentine is to put on Twenty Ewes and John Stratton forty Ewes for which they Are to have the wool of their Own sheep the first year and Ever After to Devide Equally as long as they Can Agree and the Aforesaid John Stratton is to put on Twenty One head of Cattle for which he is to find water and pasturerage for the same &amp; to Carry on and Bring off and Kill all Cattle that shall be wanted Carried or Killd by James Biggs and the aforsaid John Stratton is to have Liberty to put on any person Or persons whome he shall Chuse. The agreement is signed by Valentine and Stratton and witnessed by William Jackson and William Biggs. John Handby is undoubtedly one of the Hanby family, who were small landowners in the lower part of Northampton County near the Custis lands.</p>

   <p>By count undoubtedly means at face value. At this period so many coins were clipped, shaved, or otherwise reduced in value that many were worth much less than their face value.</p>

   <p>Chrosia Graves is probably GWs former overseer Richard Croshor Graves. Foster Webb (17351795) owned 437 acres in New Kent County in 1782. George Webb the Younger (1729c.1786) owned Putney, a plantation on the Pamunkey River in New Kent County 8 miles above New Castle. Numerous members of the Wilkins family owned lands on the Eastern Shore just to the north of the Custiss Arlington plantation in Northampton County. This Mr. Wilkins may be John Wilkins, one of the appraisers of the Custis estate in Northampton County after Daniel Parke Custiss death (<a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-06-02-0164-0006" class="document">Settlement of the Daniel Parke Custis Estate, 20 April 17595 Nov. 1761, doc.
