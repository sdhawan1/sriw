<p>In my way to this place I met with your Letter of the 10th of Jany at DumfriesIn consequence of which, I immediately wrote to Mr Willis (having an oppertunity so to do) desiring him to go to Belvoir, &amp; after examining &amp; considering every thing maturely, to give me his opinion of the Rent which ought to be set upon your Interest there (collectively or seperately) that I might, by knowing the opinion of others, be enabled, as I intended to advertise the Renting of it as soon as I came to this place, to give answers to any applications which should be
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-10-02-pb-0095">[95]</span>
made; what follows is his answer as I wrote both to Berkeley &amp; Belvr as he was expected at the latter place.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0001-ptr">1</a></p>
<p>Whether Mr Willis is under, or over the Notch, time only can determineI wish he may not have exceeded it, although I apprehend you will be disappointed at his estimate for you will please to consider, that, there are very few People who are of ability to pay a Rent equivalent to the Interest of the Money which such buildings may have cost, who are not either already provided with a Seat, or would choose to buy one, in order to Improve it; chance indeed, may throw a Person peculiarly circumstancd in the way, by which means a good Rent may be had, but this is to be viewd in the light of a lucky hit not as a matter of expectation; for the generalty of Renters would not give, I conceive, any more rent for the mansion House than if the Land was totally divested of It; &amp; as to your Fishery at the Racoon Branch, I think you will be disappointed there likewise as there is no Landing on this side the River that Rents for more than <span class="choice addition" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover_choice ] header=[]  body=[ Added &lt;span style='font-size: 90%'&gt;[[2006-04-12]]&lt;/span&gt; ]">one</span> half of what you expect for that and those on the other side opposite to you (equally good they say) to be had at 15 Maryld Curry however Sir every notice that can, shall be given of their disposal, &amp; nothing in my power, wanting to put them of to the best advantage in the manner desird. I have already advertizd the Publick of this matter, also of the Sale of your Furniture, as you may see, by the Inclosd Gazette, which I send, as it contains some acct of our American transactions respecting the oppressive and arbitrary Act of Parliament<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> for stopping up the Port &amp; commerce of Boston; The Advertisements are in Mrs Rinds Gazette also&amp; the one relative to Renting shall be put into the Papers of Maryland &amp; Pensylvania whilst the other is already printed in hand Bills, &amp; shall be distributed in the several Counties &amp; Parts round about us, that notice thereof may be as general as possible.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> the other parts of your Letter relative to the removal of your Negros Stock &amp;ca shall be complied with &amp; you may rely upon it that your Intention of not returning to Virginia shall never transpire from me though give me leave to add by way of caution to you that a belief of this sort generally prevails, &amp; hath done so for sometime whether from People, conjectures, or any thing you may have dropt I know not. I have never heard the most distant Insinuation of Lord Dunmores wanting Belvoir nor am I inclind to think he does as he talks much of

a Place he has purchasd near the warm Springs, In short I do not know of any Person at present that is Inclind that way. I shall look for your Bonds when I return, and do with them as directedyour Books of Accts I found in your Escruitore, &amp; never heard of a Ballances drawn or Settlement thereof made by Messrs Adam &amp; Campbell but will now endeavour to do this myself.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0004-ptr">4</a></p>
<p>Our Assembly met at this place the 4th Ulto according to Proragation, and was dissolvd the 26th for entering into a resolve of which the Inclosd is a Copy, and which the Govr thought reflected too much upon his Majesty, &amp; the British Parliamt to pass over unnoticed<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0005" id="GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0005-ptr">5</a>this Dissolution was as sudden as unexpected<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0006" id="GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0006-ptr">6</a> for th[e]re were other resolves of a much more spirited Nature ready to be offerd to the House wch would have been<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0007" id="GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0007-ptr">7</a> adopted respecting the Boston Port Bill as it is calld<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0008" id="GEWN-02-10-02-0067-fn-0008-ptr">8</a> but were withheld till the Important business of the Country could be gone through.

   <p>GW struck out here a paragraph which he first numbered 2 and then changed to 3. It reads: Inclosd you have a Copy of the Acct I settled before I left home with Mr Craven Peytonas also of my Acct in the New Church at Pohick which is now conveyed to you by the Vestry &amp; Upon Record.

   <p>Dunmore had acquired a great deal of land in Virginia, especially in the west. Earlier this same year the governor purchased a ninety-nine-year lease on a 1,100acre plantation located at the confluence of the Potomac River and Warm Spring Run in what was then Berkeley County. The Warm Springs, now Berkeley Springs, W.Va., was nearby. Dunmore borrowed money from Edward Snickers to finance the purchase and development of the land which he called Mount Charlotte. Snickerss loan was never repaid, but Snickers held and operated the plantation for Dunmore and received the profits from it until his death in 1790. By provisions of Snickerss will his son William took over and managed the land (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Ingrid Jewell Jones. &lt;i&gt;Edward Snickers, Yeoman&lt;/i&gt;.

   <p>GW deleted &amp; effectual before measures and inserted effectually here. The association adopted by the members of the burgesses at the Raleigh Tavern on 27 May, the day after Lord Dunmore dissolved the House, is printed, ibid., 9798. At a second meeting on 30 May, which GW also attended, the decision was reached to call together the late Representatives to meet at Williamsburg on the first Day of August (ibid., 99100). The original signed document of the 30 May meeting is in the Virginia State Library. The broadside calling for the meeting in August, which GW enclosed, reads: WILLIAMSBURG, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">May</span> 31, 1774. G<span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">entlemen</span>, LAST <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Sunday</span> Morning several Letters were received from <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Boston, Philadelphia</span>, and <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Maryland</span>, on the most interesting and important Subject of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">American</span> Grievances. The Inhabitants of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Boston</span> seem to be in a most piteous and melancholy Situation, and are doubtful whether they will be able to sustain the impending Blow without the Assistance and Cooperation of the other Colonies. By the Resolutions of their Town Meeting, it appears to be their Opinion that the most effectual Assistance which can be given them by their Sister Colonies will arise from a general Association against Exports and Imports, of every Kind, to or from <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Great Britain</span>. Upon Receipt of this important Intelligence, the Moderator judged it most prudent immediately to convene as many of the late Representatives as could be got together, and yesterday, at a Meeting of twenty five of the late Members, we took the Business under our most serious Consideration. Most Gentlemen present seemed to think it absolutely necessary for us to enlarge our late Association, and that we ought to adopt the Scheme of Nonimportation to a very large Extent; but we were divided in our Opinions as to stopping our Exports. We could not, however, being so small a Proportion of the late Associates, presume to make any Alteration in the Terms of the general Association, and therefore resolved to invite all the Members of the late House of Burgesses to a general Meeting in this City on the first Day of <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">August</span> next. We fixed this distant Day in Hopes of accommodating the Meeting to every Gentlemans private Affairs, and that they might, in the mean Time, have an Opportunity of collecting the Sense of their respective Counties. The Inhabitants of this City were convened yesterday in the Afternoon, and most chearfully acceded to the Measures we had adopted.</p>


   <p>We flatter ourselves it is unnecessary to multiply Words to induce your Compliance with this Invitation, upon an Occasion which is, confessedly, of the most lasting Importance to all <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">America</span>. Things seem to be hurrying to an alarming Crisis, and demand the speedy, united Councils of all those who have a Regard for the common Cause. We are, Gentlemen, your most affectionate Friends, and obedient humble Servants,</p>
