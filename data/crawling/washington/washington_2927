   <p>For Hills troubles with coachman Jemmy (Jammey), see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-09-02-0132" class="document">Hill to GW, 5 Feb. 1773</a>. Mr. Graves may be either Henry Graves of Skimino on the York River in York County or his brother, GWs former overseer Richard Croshor Graves. The latter by 1768 was living on the Chickahominy River in New Kent County but also owned land in James City County. Mr Moodey is probably Matthew Moody, Sr., a tavern keeper whose house was near Capitol Landing on Queens Creek. Moodys death in 1775 elicited the following testimonial: Died, Mr. MATTHEW MOODY, senior, in a very advanced age. Like the rest of the human race, he had foibles; but a charitable disposition towards his fellow creatures, and many other good qualities which he possessed, far eclipsed them (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Virginia Gazette</span> [Pinkney; Williamsburg], 8 June 1775).</p>


   <p>Moody may well have had a grudge against Daniel Parke Custis and his heirs. An undated incomplete deposition in a suit by Daniel Parke Custis against Matthew and Anne Moody is in the Custis Papers at the Virginia Historical Society. The deposition indicates that John Custis had for a number of years before his death showered both Matthew Moody and his wife Anne with gifts, including furniture, a horse, and a number of pieces of silver plate, some previously belonging to Custiss father-in-law, Daniel Parke. Custis had also made Matthew Moody trustee for a piece of land that he had given to his freed slave Jack. According to the deposition John Custis told Anne Moody that he had rather this Defendt [Anne Moody] shoud have them than any Dandridges Daughter or any Dandridge that ever wore an Head[.] he said that he had not been at Work all his Lifetime for Dandridges Daughter alluding as this Deft understood to a Daughter of Mr John Dandridge of New Kent County to whom the complainant as this Deft heard about that Time was making his Addresses by Way of Courtship for which Match this Deft had at several Times heard the sd John Custis express a very great Dislike imagining, as this Defent has understood that the sd Mr Dandridges Daughter was much inferior to his Son the Complaint in Point of Fortune. Nothing has been found concerning the outcome of this suit.</p>


   <p>In John Custiss will dated 14 Nov. 1749, he left Anne Moody an annuity of 20 sterling and the picture of his young negro boy Christened John otherwise Called Jack born of the body of my slave Alice (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Virginia Historical Society, Richmond ]">ViHi</span>: Custis Papers).</p>
