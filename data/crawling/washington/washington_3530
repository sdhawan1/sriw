This letter fell into British hands when a party from a British warship captured its bearer, Benjamin Hichborn, while he was crossing Narragansett Bay on his way to Cambridge. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-01-02-0150" class="document">GW to Hancock, 45 Aug. 1775</a>, and <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-01-02-0159" class="document">James Warren to GW, 5 Aug. 1775</a>. The letter was forwarded to Vice Admiral Samuel Graves at Boston, who gave a copy to Gen. Thomas Gage, and both Graves and Gage subsequently sent copies to England. Graves apparently kept the original letter which has not been found. On 17 Aug. 1775 the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Massachusetts Gazette: and the Boston Weekly News-Letter</span> printed a doctored version of the letter, in which the following spurious paragraph appears at the end of the section dated 21 July: As I was in the pleasing Task of writing to you, a little Noise occasioned me to turn my Head round, and who should appear but pretty little Kate the Washer-womans Daughter over the Way, clean, trim and rosey as the Morning; I snatchd the golden glorious Opportunity, and but for that cursed Antidote to Love, Sukey, I had fitted her for my General against his Return. We were obliged to part, but not till we had contrived to meet again; if she keeps the Appointment I shall relish a Weeks longer stayI give you now and then some of these Adventures to amuse you, and unbend your Mind from the Cares of War. Nothing is known about the authorship of this paragraph which was clearly intended to create a scandal among the Patriots. The copy in the Public Record Office that Gage enclosed to the earl of Dartmouth does not contain the spurious paragraph, nor does the copy of that copy at the William Salt Library. The copy in the Public Record Office that Graves enclosed to Philip Stephens, secretary of the Admiralty, and the two copies at the Clements Library, University of Michigan, do contain the spurious paragraph. Many American and British newspapers reprinted the doctored letter from the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Massachusetts Gazette</span>, and there are numerous manuscript copies of it in various repositories in addition to the ones cited here. For an account of this document and the spurious paragraph, see Allen French, The First George Washington Scandal, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society&lt;/i&gt;.

   <p>Benjamin Harrison (c.17261791) of Charles City County, Va., served with GW for many years in the Virginia House of Burgesses and was one of
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-03-01-02-pb-0149">[149]</span>
his fellow delegates in both the First and Second Continental Congresses. Harrison remained in Congress until October 1777, playing a prominent role in military affairs. On 30 Sept. 1775 he was appointed to the three-member camp committee that went to Cambridge to confer with GW about ways of supporting and regulating the army. Harrison was named to the marine committee in March 1776, to another camp conference committee in May 1776, and to the newly created Board of War in June 1776. After his return to Virginia in 1777, he served as speaker of the house of delegates from 1778 to 1781 and as governor from 1781 to 1784. Although the spurious paragraph that was added to Harrisons letter was regarded as genuine by John and Samuel Adams and Arthur Lee among others, its publication apparently did not injure Harrisons close working relationship with GW.</p>

   <p>Harrison is referring to the complaints that GW made in his <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-01-02-0047-0003" class="document">letter to Hancock of 1011 July 1775</a>. The second engineer was William Burbeck. John Adams was provoked to write to William Tudor on 23 July: I want to know if there are any Engineers in the Province and who they are. I have heard the Generals were much disappointed, in not finding Engineers, and Artillery as they expected. P[lease] let me know the Truth of this, if you can learn it, and how they come to expect a better Artillery than they found (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Robert J.

I can never Sufficiently regret, that this Congress have acted So much out of Character, as to leave the Appointment of the Quarter Master General, Commissary of Musters and Commissary of Artillery to the General, Adams wrote to James Warren on 26 July. As these officers, are Checks upon the General, and he a Check upon them: there ought not to be too much Connection between them. They ought not to be under any dependance upon him, or So great Obligations of Gratitude as these of a Creature to the Creator (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Robert J.

On 7 July Dunmore, accompanied by Montagu and Foy, went up the York River by barge and landed at Porto Bello, his farm about six miles from Williamsburg. After dinner there, Dunmores party was alarmed by the appearance of a company of Hanover County volunteers commanded by Capt. Samuel Meredith (born c.1731), a brother-in-law of Patrick Henry. Forced to flee, Dunmore returned to the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Fowey</span> and remained aboard until 15 July, at which time the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Fowey</span>s impending departure from Virginia obliged him to transfer to another warship. Dunmore stayed in the Chesapeake Bay until the summer of 1776, attempting to reestablish his authority in the colony with military force, but failed in all of his efforts. He returned to England and later became governor of the Bahamas.</p>

   <p>Edmund Randolph (17531813), a young lawyer from Williamsburg, belonged to a prominent Virginia family which was divided by the Revolution. His father, John Randolph (c.17281784), who served as attorney general of the colony from 1766 to 1774, was an outspoken Loyalist, while his uncle, Peyton Randolph (17211775), a brother-in-law of Benjamin Harrison and speaker of the House of Burgesses for the past nine years, became a
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-03-01-02-pb-0151">[151]</span>
Patriot leader, serving as president of the first three Virginia conventions and of First and Second Continental Congresses. Edmund Randolph sided with his uncle and remained in Virginia when his father departed for England in September 1774. On 15 Aug. 1775 GW appointed Edmund Randolph one of his aides-de-camp, a position Randolph held until 2 Nov. 1775, when Peyton Randolphs death obliged him to return to Virginia to attend to family affairs. Edmund Randolph became attorney general of Virginia in the spring of 1776 and was a member of Congress in 1779, 1781, and 1782.</p>

   <p>Capt.

   <p>Thomas Price (17321795) of Frederick, Md., marched with his men from Frederick on 18 July 1775 and arrived at Cambridge about 11 August. He returned home the following November and in January 1776 became major of Col. William Smallwoods Maryland regiment. In December 1776 Price was promoted to colonel of the 2d Maryland Regiment, a position that he held until he resigned from the army in April 1780. The name Flighman appears as Tilghman in the copies of this letter in the Dartmouth Mss. at the William Salt Library, in P.R.O., C.O.5/122, ff. 8083, and in the Clements Library. He was probably Matthew Tilghman (17181790) of Queen Anne County, Md., who served in Congress from September 1774 to December 1776.</p>
