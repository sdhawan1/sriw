<p>Your Proposal concerning an Entry on the Ohio I am fully of Opinion will answer: indeed it is what I had before determined upon, and am much rejoiced that you propose to be a Partner in the Scheme. I had obtained Leave to be at Williamsburg on the Meeting of the Assembly in November, with no other View, than that of securing to myself so much Land, as I was entitled to by the Governors Proclamation; which allowed Us such Terms that We cant possibly lose by itand as I determine to go to England this Year, I thought it proper to settle that Point before I embarked it must be of Service in Time to comeLands on the Ohio will be valuable.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-06-02-0186-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-06-02-0186-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> You may bid Me do any Thing you think necessary till We meet at Williamsburg, no Doubt you will be there on the Assembly, then We may surely secure it to ourselves.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-06-02-0186-fn-0005" id="GEWN-02-06-02-0186-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> Gist I believe knows the Country well, therefore woud be a good Partner.

<p>All is well and quiet on the OhioSingle Persons come from Pittsburg down. The Savages come in to the General in great Numbers begging Remission of their Sins, and Forgiveness for past Offences. The General told Me, there were sometimes 1000 there at onceThe French, you certainly must have heard, have evacuated and burnt their Forts at VenangoPresque Isle, and Le Bufe, and retired to Detroit.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-06-02-0186-fn-0007" id="GEWN-02-06-02-0186-fn-0007-ptr">7</a></p>

I really cant charge myself with ever promising either of Them that I woud dietherefore they have nothing to object to Me upon the Occasion.</p>

   <p>When the 2d Virginia Regiment was disbanded in December 1758, its lieutenant colonel, George Mercer, continued with the Virginia forces at Winchester as a volunteer until Maj. Gen. John Stanwix made him assistant deputy quarter master general for Virginia and Maryland. Stanwix succeeded Forbes after Forbess death in March 1759 as commander of the British forces in Pennsylvania and the southern colonies.</p>

   <p>No evidence of any communication until now between GW and Mercer after GWs departure from Winchester in December 1758 has been found, except that GW records on 10 Feb. 1759 receiving from Mercer 21.10 for a horse (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Manuscript Ledger Book 1, 1750-72, in George Washington Papers, Library of Congress. ]">Ledger A</span>, 52).</p>

   <p>The departure of the French from the Forks of the Ohio in late 1758 opened the way for the veterans of Virginias campaign in 1754 to begin to stake out claims to land on the Ohio to which they were entitled under the terms of Lt. Gov. Robert Dinwiddies proclamation setting aside 200,000 acres of land on the Ohio to be divided amongst them immediately after the Performance of the said Service [against the French and their Indian allies in 1754], in a Proportion due to their respective Merit, as shall be represented to me by their Officers (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Pennsylvania Gazette</span> [Philadelphia], 12 Mar. 1754). Because the British government closed the Ohio country to settlement in 1763 at
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-06-02-pb-0346">[346]</span>
the end of the war, it was not until December 1769 that GW petitioned the colonial governor and council for the land to which the officers and men of the Virginia Regiment of 1754 were entitled, and it was not until November 1772 that GW and his old comrades received their first allotments of land under Dinwiddies proclamation (see <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ H. R. McIlwaine et al., eds. &lt;i&gt;Executive Journals of the Council of Colonial Virginia&lt;/i&gt;. 6 vols. Richmond, 192566. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Exec.

   <p>That GW and Mercer did confer in Williamsburg while GW was attending the assembly, which met 121 Nov. 1759, seems likely. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-06-02-0213" class="document">Mercer to GW, 17 Feb. 1760</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#GEWN-02-06-02-0186-fn-0006-ptr" id="GEWN-02-06-02-0186-fn-0006">6</a>

   <p>Apparently GW, Mercer, and Robert Stewart had entered an agreement with Capt. Christopher Gist to have Gist lay claim for them to land along the Ohio to which they were entitled under Dinwiddies proclamation of 1754. On 28 Sept. 1759 Robert Stewart wrote GW from Pittsburgh: . . . the more I see of this Charming Country, the more Im enamourd with it, which leads me to enquire after what Steps have been taken, in secureing to us, those Lands which poor Capn Gist was to have enterd for us, I hope the needful is done, they surely will soon be very valueable. As all three men were aware, Christopher Gist had died of smallpox in July (on 25 July 1759) while returning to Winchester from Williamsburg. It would appear, therefore, that when Mercer speaks of Gist as a likely partner he is speaking of the son, Lt. Nathaniel Gist, who acted as a guide for GWs brigade when it marched toward Fort Duquesne in November 1758. On the other hand, it would appear that he is referring to the elder Gist when he speaks of the claims or Entries that Gist made for them.</p>

   <p>Right after the event, Lt. Col. Thomas Lloyd wrote General Stanwix from Fort Ligonier (Loyalhanna) on 23 May: Captain Bullet on his March from Bedford [Pa.] with a Convoy of Fifteen Waggons and Fifteen Thousand Weight of Pork, his Party consisting off one Hundred Virginians was this Day defeated within Four Miles of Ligonier by a Party off the Enemy. . . . Five of the Waggons (Four of them off Pork) were burnt all the Horses kiled or taken. . . . this happend about three in the Afternoon at a Time when the most violent Tornado of Rain Thunder &amp; Lightning that I ever experiencd (ibid., 30911).
