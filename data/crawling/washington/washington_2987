   <p>George Mercer was living in London and for several years had been hoping to become the governor of the new colony for which the Walpole associates
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-09-02-pb-0304">[304]</span>
had been attempting to get approval since 1770 (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-08-02-0247&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-08-02-0247-fn-0004#GEWN-02-08-02-0247-fn-0004" class="document">Jonathan Boucher to GW, 18 Aug. 1770, n.4</a>). On 2 Dec. 1773 George Mercer wrote George William Fairfax, saying that he had heard that Fairfax, who had just spent several weeks in London before going on to York to live, was attempting to block the formation of the colony and Mercers appointment as governor. Mercer wrote: My dear Sir: If this letter should break in upon your retirement I pray you Sir to allow the subject to plead an apology and I am sure it will, as my interest and the furtherance of some of my schemes are dependent upon it. Perhaps you thought, I am sure you wished, that all my Vandalia prospects, were ere this fully within my grasp, but my ill stars still prevail against me. I am not yet Governor, and a fresh objection, the last I hope they have to offer, has arisen against the policy of the grant, so far as it relates to Britain. It is urged that Colonel Fairfax a gentleman lately arrived from Virginia, has confirmed what Lord Hillsborough had suggested, that the inhabitants of Vandalia were not only out of reach of the arms, but the commerce of Great Britain, and that Colonel Fairfax had said many thousand families were settled within the bounds of the new Province, and that each of them had a loom and spinning wheel, and would always manufacture every article of cloath they wanted, of course would not want any British manufactures: and that the people on the Ohio might be easily and conveniently governed by Virginia, which not only made the establishment of a new and separate government totally unnecessary, but that the separation of the intended government from that of Virginia under which it was at present, and by whom they were governed, would occasion great murmurs and perhaps insurrections among the settlers.</p>


   <p>I do not presume my dear Sir to oppose my own opinion to one so well informed as I am sure you are, and did I suspect you thought what was <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">reported</span> to have been your declaration, it would certainly have great weight in future with me, and indeed would, with as much decency as was practicable, retract what really has hitherto been my opinion. I must however pay that respect to the opinion I have hitherto maintained, to suppose this <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">report</span> has been spread as coming from one of your knowledge and authority in Virginia, in order to support Lord Hillsboroughs assertions, and I am the more persuaded to this, as I recollect you were so obliging as to mention some conversation you had with Mr Pownall, in which you desired you might not be called before any public Board, being in no way interested, and having no knowledge of the dispute between Pennsylvania, Maryland, and the Vandalians about the boundaries of the Provinces, and that you should have stepped forth, justified as you thought you were in your public character to have asserted the claims, and ask redress of the injuries, if any had been offered to Virginia. I beg your pardon, my dear Sir, for presuming to give you this trouble, and I know public justice as well as your friendship manifested to me on so many occasions, will plead my excuse for asking your answer to this letter.</p>


   <p>My best wishes attend Mrs Fairfax, and I am with the utmost sincerity my dear Sir Your much obliged friend and obedient servant [signed] G<span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">eo.</span> F.
