This letter is one of a packet of nine documents which came to light in 1922 in the Minnesota Historical Society. Congressman Andrew Stewart of Pennsylvania used the documents in preparing House Report no. 228 of 1826 on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.

Semples letter is endorsed, in an unknown but probably eighteenth-century hand, From Mr John Semple 8th Jany 1773, but Semple clearly dates the letter 1770, not 1773, and its contents confirm that it was not written as late as 1773. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-08-02-0196" class="document">John Semples Proposal for Potomac Navigation</a>, 1769.</p>


   <p>John Semple (d. 1773), a Scot, in 1757 went into business in Port Tobacco, Md., with his brother-in-law John Lawson. In 1763 he took over John Ballendines iron furnace and gristmills on Occoquan Creek in Prince William County, Va., and moved there. Semple was also operating by 1763 just above Harpers Ferry on the Virginia banks of the Potomac an iron furnace which he named Keep Triste. In May 1765 he bought from Thomas Colvill for 2,500 sterling a tract of 6,300 acres, called Merryland, across the river in Frederick County, Maryland. Like his fellow entrepreneur John Ballendine, Semple
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-08-02-pb-0294">[294]</span>
 greatly overextended himself, and by 1770 he was in deep financial trouble. At his death in 1773 he left his creditors to fight over what remained of his holdings. GW in 1770 was actively involved with Semple in two other matters not directly related to the improvement of navigation on the Potomac. As one of the executors of the estate of Thomas Colvill (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-08-02-0039" class="document">GW to John West, Jr., December 1767</a>, and notes), GW was concerned about Semples inability to make the promised payment for the Merryland estate he had bought from Colvill. In 1771 Semple assigned his rights to the land to three merchants, two in Dumfries and one in Georgetown, Md. (see <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig, eds. &lt;i&gt;The Diaries of George Washington&lt;/i&gt;. 6 vols. Charlottesville, Va., 197679. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Diaries</span></span>, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-01-03-02-0001-0030#GEWN-01-03-02-pb-0078" class="document">3:78</a>). GW also was one of the four men who spent five days in Colchester in August 1770 trying in vain to mediate a dispute, probably over the iron deposits on the Merryland tract, between Semple and Dr. David Ross, one of the owners of the Antietam, or Frederick, ironworks near the mouth of Antietam Creek in Frederick County, Md. (ibid., 2:264). Semple himself was at Mount Vernon twice in January 1770 and three other times before the end of the year.</p>

   <p>Mr Kenneday may be David Kennedy who since 1766 had rented land from GW on Bullskin Run, in Frederick County. Kennedys place was not far from Semples furnace, Keep Triste, to which Semple is here referring. GW had frequent dealings with Dr. David Ross, a merchant in Bladensburg, Maryland.</p>

   <p>He is perhaps referring to the bill regarding the navigation of the Potomac drawn up by GW and others, which the House of Burgesses had passed a few weeks before. See John Semples Proposal for Potomac Navigation, 1769, n.3.</p>

   <p>If the Potomac River bill drawn up in December 1769 by Richard Henry Lee and GW did include, as Semple seems to indicate, a provision for financing improvements of navigation solely with private funds lent at interest, GW changed his mind about this, for in July 1770 he was taking Semples position and arguing the infeasibility of relying entirely on private investments of this sort. Rather, he favored what the Virginia legislature was to adopt in 1772 and what both the Virginia and the Maryland legislatures adopted in 1784, the vesting of subscribers with a kind of property in the Navigation of the river, whereby investors collected the tolls and retained control of the proceeds (<a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-08-02-0239" class="document">GW to Thomas Johnson, 20 July 1770</a>; see also 8 <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William Waller Hening, ed. &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia, from the First Session of the Legislature, in the Year 1619&lt;/i&gt;. 13 vols. 181923.
