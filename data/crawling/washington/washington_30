<p>E<span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ditorial</span> N<span class="hi-small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">ote</span>The reports that GW made to Dinwiddie upon his return from his mission to the French commandant reinforced the governors conviction that no time was to be lost in taking action against French encroachment on the Ohio. Dinwiddie had held a British vessel, the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Speedwell</span>, in port pending GWs return from the Ohio and at once notified Holderness and the Board of Trade that the earlier reports of French infiltration had been confirmed. Mr Washington had my Orders to make what Observations he coud on his Journey, &amp; to take a Plan of their Fort, . . . He assures me that they have begun another Fort at the Mouth of the Creek, which he thinks will be finishd by the Month of March. There were in the Fort where the Commander resided, about 300 regular Forces; &amp; nine hundred more were gone to Winter Quarters (in order to save their Provisions) to some Forts on Lake Erie &amp;ca but that they were to return by the Month of March; then they fully determind with all the Forces they coud collect, which he understood woud be fifteen hundred regulars, besides Indians, to go down the River Ohio, &amp; propose building many other Forts, &amp; that their chief residence woud be at the Logstown; &amp; that they had near three hundred Canoes to transport their Soldiers, Provisions &amp; Ammunition &amp;ca.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0001-ptr">1</a></p>
<p>On 21 Jan. Dinwiddie presented the unaccommodating reply of the French commandant to the council, which advised the governor as an emergency measure to recruit 100 men from Frederick and Augusta counties to be placed under GWs command and proceed immediately to the frontier. In addition, Capt. William Trent was to be ordered to raise what Traders and other Men he can to annoy the Enemy<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0002-ptr">2</a>; presumably Trents recruiting activities would net another 100 men. The House of Burgesses, prorogued until the last Thursday in April 1754, should be called into immediate session.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> Dinwiddies most pressing need was for the money and supplies that only the burgesses could provide, but in the meantime he ordered Trent to the Forks of the Ohio to superintend the construction of a fort on the site<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> and appointed John Carlyle commissary of provisions and stores with headquarters at Alexandria.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0005" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> The ordnance promised to Dinwiddie by Holderness in Aug. 1753 finally arrived in the colony and included 30 cannon and 80 barrels of powder, as well as other stores. Dinwiddie had hoped to use the cannon to protect the new fort at the
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0064">[64]</span>
Forks of the Ohio, but he wrote to the Board of Trade, 29 Jan. 1754, that the guns are much too large to be transported so great a distance by land, and in bad roads. However, I shall make a tryal of ten; if we can get them carried to the fort they will be very serviceable.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0006" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0006-ptr">6</a></p>
<p>By the time the burgesses convened, Dinwiddie had already written to the governors of nearby states asking for cooperation in opposing the French. As he informed the burgesses, their Eyes are fixd on your Proceedings, and I hope you will engage them, by a laudable Example, to contribute sufficiently for the common Cause.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0007" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0007-ptr">7</a> The response of the other colonies to Dinwiddies appeals was disappointing. Although Gov. James Hamilton of Pennsylvania supported Dinwiddie, the Pennsylvania Assembly, largely Quaker and influenced by the uncertainty of Pennsylvanias claims in the Ohio country, refused repeatedly to vote funds for defense. Maryland governor Horatio Sharpe wrote Dinwiddie that the assembly had come to a resolution that the Exigencies of Affairs was not such as required any Aid or Support from them. The North Carolina Assembly did grant a supply of 12,000 for defense, and South Carolina promised to contribute proportionately to the other colonies.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0008" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0008-ptr">8</a></p>
<p>On 14 Feb. 1754 the Virginia House of Burgesses met to consider Dinwiddies reports and on 22 Feb. passed an act authorizing 10,000 for the defense of the frontier. As Dinwiddie observed, the sum was secured with great Applicatn: many Argumts: &amp; with much difficulty.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0009" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0009-ptr">9</a> Much of Dinwiddies difficulty in persuading the House of Burgesses to vote adequate sums for defense arose out of the governors disputes with the legislature over domestic matters, most recently the conflict over the pistole fee. However, some of the problems stemmed from a suspicion widely held not only in Virginia but in other colonies as well that the proposed military expeditions were designed to further the interests of the Ohio Company of which Dinwiddie was an ardent supporter. As GW later wrote, his report of French military activity on the Ohio was yet thought a Fiction; and Scheme to promote the Interest of a private Company (by many Gentlemen that had a share in Government) . . . . These unfavourable Surmises causd great delays in raiseing the first Men and Money.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0010" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0010-ptr">10</a></p>
<p>Although Dinwiddie had been ordered by the crown to raise the militia, the situation was complicated by uncertainty as to whether the land around the Fork belonged to Virginia or to Pennsylvania. Since the militia law implied that militia could not be employed outside the boundaries of the colony, Dinwiddie encountered increasing opposition in the counties to conscripting troops and to the recruiting effort. As a result he was forced to rely on volunteers rather than regularly conscripted militia, but, as he observed to Lord Holderness, I think
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0065">[65]</span>
300 Men raisd voluntarily will do more Service than 800 Men of the Militia forcd on the Service.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0011" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0011-ptr">11</a> With the 10,000 voted by the burgesses Dinwiddie began the process of raising 6 companies of volunteers of 50 men each. By mid-March he had appointed officers to begin recruiting and hoped to have a force of 300 troops at Alexandria by 20 Mar. to escort guns and supplies to the Forks of the Ohio. On 19 Feb. 1754, in order to encourage enlistment, Dinwiddie issued a proclamation promising grants of land to volunteers who completed a tour of duty.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0012" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0012-ptr">12</a></p>
<p>After GWs arrival in Williamsburg in January, Dinwiddie placed him on active pay as a captain, although as adjutant he still held the rank of major attached to that post.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0013" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0031-fn-0013-ptr">13</a></p>

William Trent (17151787) of Lancaster, Pa., had already been an Indian trader and land speculator on the Pennsylvania frontier. He participated in the aborted 1746 campaign against Canada, acted frequently as an Indian agent for the Pennsylvania legislature, and in the 1740s formed a business partnership with George Croghan. In the early 1750s, as an agent for the Ohio Company, Trent constructed storehouses and a fort on the frontier. As early as Aug. 1753 William Fairfax had suggested that Trent be commissioned to raise a Body of Rangers to give British traders and friendly Indians some sense of security, but the council held back, awaiting instructions from England (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ H.

   <p>Lord Fairfax was county lieutenant of Frederick County and hence the commander of the Frederick militia. From 1738 to 1754 Frederick County was the more northern of Virginias two frontier counties, extending west and northwest from the Blue Ridge Mountains. Later in 1754 the county was cut off at the Cacapon Mountains and the new northern frontier county of Hampshire was formed. Dinwiddie had requested Fairfax to direct the Militia of Frederick to be drawn out, &amp; fifty Men to be inlisted for that Service (Jan. 1754, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Virginia Historical Society, Richmond ]">ViHi</span>: Dinwiddie Papers).</p>

   <p>Apparently GW was allowed to name two junior officers to assist him: James Towers was commissioned ensign and Jacob Van Braam, who was sent to Augusta, was made lieutenant (A Roll of Officers and Soldiers . . . before the Battle of the Meadows, 30 April 1771, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>). James Patton (16921755), a leading land speculator and entrepreneur of Augusta County, emigrated from Ireland to Virginia in 1738. In 1752 Dinwiddie appointed him county lieutenant for Augusta, which had been created out of the frontier county of Orange in 1738. Patton was killed by a party of Shawnee in the summer of 1755.
