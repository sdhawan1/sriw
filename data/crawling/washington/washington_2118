   <p>The prospect of the French withdrawal from continental North America at the end of the French and Indian War precipitated in the early 1760s in America and Britain the formation of a number of companies for taking up and colonizing the vast lands that came under British protection. The Mississippi Land Company (or, as GW called it, the Mississippi Adventure) was one of these. Formed by the efforts largely of four Lee brothers, it was composed mostly of Virginians living in the Potomac River valley. At the time that GW attended the meeting on 3 June to organize the Mississippi Land Company, he was on his way home to Mount Vernon from a trip to Williamsburg and the Dismal Swamp (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-07-02-0163&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-07-02-0163-sn#GEWN-02-07-02-0163-sn" class="document">Dismal Swamp Land Company: Articles of Agreement, 3 Nov. 1763, source note</a><span class="choice deletion" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover_choice ] header=[]  body=[ Deleted: ', printed below' &lt;span style='font-size: 90%'&gt;[[2014-11-11]]&lt;/span&gt; ]"><img alt="deletion" src="images/deletion_mark-trans.png" style="border:none;vertical-align: text-bottom; padding-right:2px"/></span>). On 2 June he was at Leedstown (then in King George County), and on 3 June he crossed the Potomac at Hooes ferry in Stafford County (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-07-02-0133" class="document">Cash Accounts, June 1763</a><span class="choice deletion" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover_choice ] header=[]  body=[ Deleted: ', printed above' &lt;span style='font-size: 90%'&gt;[[2014-11-11]]&lt;/span&gt; ]"><img alt="deletion" src="images/deletion_mark-trans.png" style="border:none;vertical-align: text-bottom; padding-right:2px"/></span>). It is likely that the organizational meeting of 3 June was at one of the sites of subsequent meetings, at Stafford County Court House, then on Potomac Creek, or at nearby Belleview (Bellview), the house of Thomas Ludwell Lee. The first regular meeting of the company held under the Articles of Agreement was at Belleview on 9 Sept. 1763, when GW was present; and the Mississippi Land Company was active at least as late as 1768 (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-07-02-0150&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-07-02-0150-sn#GEWN-02-07-02-0150-sn" class="document">the source note in the Mississippi Land Companys Memorial to the King, 9 Sept. 1763</a><span class="choice deletion" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover_choice ] header=[]  body=[ Deleted: ', printed below' &lt;span style='font-size: 90%'&gt;[[2014-11-24]]&lt;/span&gt; ]"><img alt="deletion" src="images/deletion_mark-trans.png" style="border:none;vertical-align: text-bottom; padding-right:2px"/></span>).

   <p>At the initial meeting of the Mississippi Land Company on 9 Sept., there were five men listed as members who were not among the nineteen who signed the Articles of Agreement on 3 June. Eighteen of the nineteen who signed the Articles on 3 June were living in Virginia, and four of the five new men who attended the September meeting also were from Virginia. Nine of the fifty places were reserved for men in London (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-07-02-0134&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-07-02-0134-fn-0002#GEWN-02-07-02-0134-fn-0002" class="document">note 2</a>).</p>

   <p>The four Lees signing the Articles of AgreementThomas Ludwell Lee (17301778), Richard Henry Lee (17321794), Francis Lightfoot Lee (17341797), and William Lee (17391795)were sons of Thomas Lee of Stratford Hall in Westmoreland County. A fifth brother, Arthur Lee (17401792), at this time studying medicine in Scotland, was to become a member of the Mississippi Land Company and represent it in England. GW and his brother John Augustine Washington (17361787) were later joined as members by their two brothers Samuel and Charles. Dr. William Flood (d. 1775) and Richard Parker (17291813), a lawyer, were from Westmoreland County. Col. William Brockenbrough (17151778) and William Beale, Jr. (d. 1778), were Richmond County planters. Col. Presley Thornton, a planter and member of the Virginia council, and the merchant Robert Woddrop (d. 1767), lived in Northumberland County. Robert Brent (c.17301780) of Woodstock, Col. Henry Fitzhugh (17231783) of Bedford (probably the Henry Fitzhugh who signed), and William Fitzhugh (probably William Fitzhugh, Sr. [17251791], of Marmion but possibly Capt. William Fitzhugh [17291785] or William Fitzhugh, Jr. [17411809], of Somerset [later of Chatham]), were all planters in Stafford County except for Captain Fitzhugh. Anthony Stewart (died c.1791), the lone Marylander involved in the initial organization of the

Mississippi Land Company, was a merchant in Annapolis. Adam Stephen and Thomas Bullitt were GWs former companions in arms. Only GW and two or three other signers were not living in one of the counties of the Northern Neck between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers: Stafford, King George, Westmoreland, Northumberland, and Richmond. The five men who appeared at the meeting on 9 Sept. and were not signers of the Articles of Agreement were Charles Digges, a merchant in Upper Marlboro, Prince Georges County, Md., and Alexandria; James Douglas, a merchant in Dumfries, Prince William County, on the Potomac, who was married to a sister of Robert Brent (see above); Francis Thornton (d. 1784) of Society Hill, then in Stafford County, now in King George County, a brother of Presley Thornton (see above); William Brent (17331782) of Richland in Stafford County; and George Simpson, who may be the man by that name who lived in Fairfax County and died in 1782. The identifications of William Fitzhugh, Sr., Francis Thornton, and William Brent are all tentative.</p>
