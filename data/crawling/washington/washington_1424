<h1>To John Blair</h1>

<div class="docbody">
<p style="text-indent: 0;">To The President.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 0;"><span style="float: left;">Honble Sir.</span><span style="float: right;">Williamsbgh 28th May, 1758.</span></p>     
<p style="clear: both;">I came here at this critical juncture, by the express order of Sr John St Clair, to represent in the fullest manner, the posture of our Affairs at Winchester;<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> and to obviate any doubts that might arise from the best written narrativeI shall make use of the following method as the most effectual I can at present suggest, to lay sundry matters before you for your informationapprobationand direction. And I hope when your Honor considers how we are circumstanced, and how absolutely necessary dispatch; that you will please to give me explicit and speedy answers on the several points which are submitted.</p>
<p>For, without the latter, the Service will be greatly impeded, and wanting the former, my conduct may be liable to error, and to censure.</p>
<span class="pb center" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-05-02-pb-0200">[200]</span>
<p>To begin: 1st Sr John St Clairs letter will, I apprehend; inform your Honor of our principal Wants; namely, Arms, Tents, and other sorts of Field Equipage, articles so absolutely, and obviously necessary, as to need no argument to prove that the men will be useless without them: and that the vast sums of money which have been expended in levying and marching them to the place of Rendezvous, will be entirely lost: besides impeding if not defeating the Expedition, and loosing every Indian now on our frontiers by delay.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0002-ptr">2</a></p>
<p>2. The Officers will be entirely unprovided with the means of taking the Field, till they have an allowance made to them of Baggage, forage, and bat-money.</p>
<p>Governor Dinwiddie, from what cause I could never yet learn, thought proper to discontinue this allowance to the Companies that remained in Virginia, at the same time that he allowed it to those who went to Carolina: and altho I produced, from under Genl Stanwixs hand (the then commanding officer on this Quarter) that <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">all</span> Officers were entitled to <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">it</span>, and that it was indispensably necessary to equip them for, and enable them to take the Field.</p>
<p>Genl Forbes has obtained this allowance for the Pennsylvania Troops, and desired Sir John St Clair (who has given me a copy of it, signed) to urge it strongly on this Government also: see the copy.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0003-ptr">3</a></p>
<p>3. The different Pay of the two virginia Regiments will, I conceive, if a stop is not put to it, be productive of great discontent, and many Evils. For the Soldiers of the 1st Regiment, think their claim upon the Country equally good, if not <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">better</span> than that of the Second; because their Services are not limitedThey have lacked the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">great</span> Bounty, which the others have received; and have had no clothes for near 2 years, when in <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">strictness</span> they have an annual call for, and an equal right to expect them.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0004-ptr">4</a></p>
<p>4ly As our Regimental clothing can not possibly last the campaign, will it not be advisable to send for a supply against next winter? I have sent to Philadelphia for 1,000 pair of Indian Stocking (Leggings) the better to equip my men for the woods, and should be glad to know whether I am to pay for them in behalf of the Country, or deduct the cost out of their pay? As
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-05-02-pb-0201">[201]</span>
they have not received the clothing they are entitled to, they may think this latter rather hard.</p>
<p>5. Should not the Pay of the Surgeons mates in the First Regiment be equal to that of those in the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>. The latter have 4 and the former only 3/ per day. And should there not be the same number of S. mates allowed to the old, as are to the new Regiment?<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0005" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0005-ptr">5</a></p>
<p>6. It will cause great dissatisfaction in the Regiment, if Lt Baker is put over the heads of older officersIt is granted, that Mr Baker is a very <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">deserving</span> officer; but there are others equally deservingand have adventured equally to seek <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Glory</span>, and to <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">merit</span> applause! Ensign Chew, for instance, was with him when the scalps were taken; Capt. McKenzie, Lt Gist, Mr Woodward, and many others have adventured as far into the Enemys Country, tho with less success.</p>
<p>I therefore hope (to prevent the Disorders consequent upon his advancement) that your Honor will suffer Colo. Mercers company to be given to Mr Stewart, the oldest Lieutenant; as Captn Lewiss, in the like case, was to Mr Bullet.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0006" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0006-ptr">6</a></p>
<p>7. Sir John St Clair directs, in consequence of Orders from the General, that the First Virginia Regiment shall immediately be completed; and leaves the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">mode</span> of doing it, to your Honor.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0007" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0007-ptr">7</a> I should be glad of Direction in this affair. The season, I fear, is too far advanced, to attempt it <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">now</span> by Recruiting.</p>
<p>8. Lt Steenbu[r]gen having been guilty of several irregular, and ungentlemanly practises; and finding his conduct was about to be enquired into; begged leave to resignwhich I granted, so far as depended upon me: Because the crimes he was then accused of, were not sufficient to break himaltho quite sufficient to give the whole Corps, the most indifferent opinion of his morals.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0008" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0008-ptr">8</a> This resignation, and Captn Lt Stewarts promotion, will cause two vacancies in the Regiment; to fill up which, and to make the several promotions hereby occasioned, will require five blank-commissions.</p>
<p>9. I should be glad to know if the works at Fort Loudoun are still to go on? In what manner to be forwarded? and under whose direction? Nothing surely will contribute more to the public weal, than this Fort when compleated: Because it will be a valuable repository for our Stores, if the event of our Enterprize
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-05-02-pb-0202">[202]</span>
prove successful; and an assylum for the Inhabitants, (and place of retreat for our Troops) in case of a <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Defeat</span>.</p>
<p>10. Great advantages must consequently arise, by appointing Lt Smith to that direction, and to the Command of Fort Loudoun: First, because he has had the over-looking of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Works</span> for near 2 yearsis, by that means, become perfectly well acquainted with every thing intended to be doneand is exceedingly industrious.</p>
<p>Secondly, because there must necessarily be many sick and lame Soldiers left at that Garrison, who may require the eye of a diligent officer, to keep them togetherThirdly, because all the Regimental stores and Baggage must be left at that place; and ought to be under the care of an officer who can be made accountable for his conduct: and not left to the mercy of an ungovernable and refractory militia: and, forethlyit is necessary, if for no other reason than to preserve the materials for finishing the works that are now lying there.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0009" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0009-ptr">9</a></p>
<p>11. I conceive we shall be ordered to take with us the greatest part of the ammunition now at Fort Loudoun: It will [be] necessary, therefore, to have a supply laid in there, for the use of the frontier Garrisons.</p>
<p>12. I did, in a late letter, endeavour to point out in what manner the Service would be benefited by continuing Rutherfords Rangers in the Parts they now are; and sending the Militia of Prince-William to the Branch, in their steadAnd again recommend it, for the reasons then given, and for many others which might be <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">given</span>.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0010" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0010-ptr">10</a></p>
<p>I must now conclude, with once more begging that Your Honor would come to some speedy determination on these several mattersFrom what Sir John St Clair has wrotefrom my Ordersand from what I have here set forth, I conceive it must sufficiently appear, that the greatest dispatch is absolutely necessary; the success of our Expeditions in a manner, depending upon the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">early</span> commencement of it: Every delay therefore, may be attended with pernicious consequences.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0011" id="GEWN-02-05-02-0152-fn-0011-ptr">11</a></p>
<p>The Indians, glad of any pretence for returning home, will make use of delays for a handle: and a spirit of discontent and desertion may spring up among the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">New Levies</span> for want of Employment.</p>
<p>These are matters obvious to me; and my Duty requires that
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-05-02-pb-0203">[203]</span>
I represent <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">them</span> in this free and candid manner. I am your Honors most obedt and most humble Servant,</p>

   <p>GW is undoubtedly referring to St. Clairs letter to Blair of 23 May, which St. Clair seems to have let GW read and which GW seems to have himself delivered to Blair. St. Clair wrote: On the 21st at Night Mr [Alexander] Finnie brought me your Honours Letters of the 15th and 16th Inst. acquainting me, that you was not to come to this place as Genl Forbes desired . . . . Genl Forbes thought your being at this place so very material, that he acquainted the Secretary of State with it, so that the many things to be done must be delayd, and the Service retarded. Colonel Washington whose presence here woud be very necessary is obliged to go to Williamsbourg, to consult your Honour on the many things that your two Regts must have before they can take the field, and which falls on your Collony to furnish them. The General has acquainted me, by a Letter of the 7th Inst. that the Commissioners of Pensylvania at last convinced, have now come to an agreement, of allowing Camp Equipage to the Men; as likewise of an allowance of Batt Money to the Captains &amp; other officers, for carrying of their field Equipage: When you see Mr Blair at Winchester or if you coud write to him, that you will put him in mind of Camp Equipage being likewise provided for the Virginia forces, and make no doubt of their following the Example of this Province.</p>


   <p>Your Honour must be very sensible that if any Accident has happend to the Store Ship which has the Tents on board or if the fleet has a long passage, all the large Sums granted for the Service will be thrown away unless the Men have Tents, and the present Circumstances are such that the troops are immediately wanted for Service on the Frontiers which has obliged me to put Colo. Washingtons Regt under marching Orders.</p>


   <p>That there may not happen any more delays in opening the Campaign I have (with the Concurrence of Governor [Horatio] Sharpe and Colo. Washington) sent Mr [Thomas] Walker to Philadelphia to get Tents made for 2000 private Men, on a supposition of your engaging to pay for them, but if you cannot enter on that engagement, I must keep the Tents and sell them to other Regts next Spring that I may not be a looser: and your Troops will suffer the hardship of being in the field without Cover, which will infalibly create desertion and perhaps Mutiny. If the Tents were arrived from England I do not see that Colo. Washingtons Regt coud have any claim for their Share of them, for all Regts so soon as they go into Quarters make a Stoppage from the Men for Tents &amp; Kittles for their Men.</p>


   <p>Colo. Washington will give you a Copy of the orders I was obliged to give him . . ., and I must request of you not to detain him at Williamsbourg lest his Regt will be obliged to take the field before his Return (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ University of Virginia, Charlottesville ]">ViU</span>: Forbes Papers). Blair answered the letter on 3 June in a conciliatory manner, promising full cooperation (ibid.).</p>
