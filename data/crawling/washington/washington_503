<p>I Recd Yours by Capt. Bell of 10th Instant 10 Days before yours 27th Decr by Majr Lewis which only came to hand Last

Night,<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0304-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0304-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> you will See by the Inclosed Return that the Company wants but one of being Compleat: only the Mulattoes &amp; Negos are still Included.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0304-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0304-fn-0002-ptr">2</a></p>
<p>I have Inclosed an Accot for Comisy Walker of the money I recd from Mr McNeil and have all the Vouchers Lodged to Send by the first safe &amp; direct Conveyance that will grant Recpt for them, &amp; Each Voucher attested by the Subalterns.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0304-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0304-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> By the Accot you will Observe the qty of provisions does not Exceed that Agreed on by Majr Lewis &amp; You at the fort, &amp; will barely Suffice for 10 Months[.] It is true I did send down an Estimate to the Govr that he might not send half the Sum wanted, and there I sett down 32 thousd lbs. of beeff at 10/, 16020 tubs to Cure the Meat at 10/ each 10&amp; so much for Barrels.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0304-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0304-fn-0004-ptr">4</a></p>
<p>Now Sir I think it is really Amazeing that his Honr should mistake 20 tubs for a trough of which I am possitive there is not the least mention as will appear both by the principal in the Govrs hands &amp; the Copy in mine, how far his honr may be unacquainted with the qty of Beeff necessarry to Support a Company for 10 Months, I shall not determine; but certainly it must be great Inattention to mistake a Charge of 20 tubs for a trough which would rather deserve the Name of an Ark. It was much against my Inclination to Undertake playing the Comisy for the Compy as I knew that Instead of its being Esteemed an Extra Service it would Subject me to Invidious Reflections &amp; Ill-natured Censures. But I am unlucky in having prejudices Entertained agt me without any foundation, &amp; as readily believed.</p>
<p>Majr Lewis would not Send up the Act relating to deserters but desired me by a Verbal Message to try &amp; punish them before we Marched tho. he Expects we will Sett out this Week. Johnson says that in Consideration of his taking the Dutch men that deserted from Lt. Polsons Detachmt at the Dunkers he was to have his discharge of Capt. Peyronie who on his Application said he did not care to Sign a Discharge but that he might goe abt his Bussiness he would never Advertize him nor Send after him and refers to Collo.

Road when she was recommended to my care in her way to Phila. by some of the officers who Lodged at her Masters &amp; by Mrs English who waited on Mr Allen &amp; me, it is true I made her Change her resolution of going to Phila. and brought her back to Wills Creek where she was openly Seen in the Camp. I never intended to Conceal her, but on the Contrary tho. there was never no Enquiry made after her all the time I had her at Wills Creek, I Emploied Mr Stalker to buy her time and told him he might draw on me for the money. But my Station here prevented his Answer I Suppose, and you are Sensible I have not had an Oppty of Sending to Alexandria Since you Left this, besides I have never had any Conveyance to Send money from this Except Mr Gordon &amp; he went to Wills Creek so that I dont See that I have acted either Unlike an officer or a Gent: unless that a Great many would have made the same Use of a Mans Maid without making any Satisfaction to the Master or reckoning themselves under any Obligations to free the Maid from a harsh Servitude, which I all along Intended and declared, tho I never had any Application made to me by Mr Chew or any other person for him till the note that Came with Yours: and accordingly have Sent Bills to Capt. Stewart for 10who will deliver them to any Safe hand that you shall order going to Alexandria who may bring up the Indenture &amp; deliver it to him.

   <p>In accordance with <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-02-02-0282" class="document">GWs Orders of 10 Jan. 1756</a>, David Bell stopped at Fort Dinwiddie on 16 Jan. to settle Ens. William Flemings recruiting accounts before going on to the borders of Carolina to search for deserters. Andrew Lewis was en route to the New River to get the Sandy Creek expedition underway (<a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-02-02-0240" class="document">GW to Lewis, 27 Dec. 1755</a>).</p>

   <p>Hogs weekly return dated 22 Jan. 1756 and signed by Hog, Lt. John McNeill, and Fleming reported 52 rank and file with 1 wanting to Compleat, 3 sergeants, 1 drummer, and 2 corporals. During the preceding week, one soldier had died, one had been discharged, and one had deserted.</p>

   <p>In his <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-02-02-0214" class="document">letter of 14 Dec. 1755 to GW</a>, Dinwiddie complained in a postscript that Hog had asked for money to buy what appeared to be provisions for 20 months and a Trough to salt the Meat in, besides the Barrells. <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-02-02-0241" class="document">GW then wrote Hog on 27 Dec.</a> asking why he was laying in provisions for twenty months, instead of the twelve, which I ordered, and expressing amazement at his charge of 10 for a Trough. Hog is also saying here that he asked for double the amount that he needed in order to be certain he got what he had to have.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a class="note-ref" href="#GEWN-02-02-02-0304-fn-0005-ptr" id="GEWN-02-02-02-0304-fn-0005">5</a>

   <p>GW and Hog had been corresponding at cross purposes about the deserter John Johnson since Hogs letter of 29 Nov. 1755. The incident to which Johnson referred took place during Braddocks expedition or before, for Capt. William La Pronie was killed in the battle on the Monongahela in July 1755. These may be the same deserters referred to by Charles Smith in his letter of 27 Aug. 1758 to GW (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>) as having deserted from the Dunkers just before the Scrumage at the Great meadoes. The Dunkers, or Dunkards, also known as German Baptists, are today members of the Church of the Brethren. The first settlers of this sect on the Virginia frontier were led in the 1740s by the Echerlin brothers from the Dunker cloister at Ephrata, Pa., to the west bank of the New River. In the early 1750s the Echerlins led a small party to settle on what became known as Dunkards Creek in Pennsylvania and about 1755 moved on to the Cheat River at what came to be called Dunkards Bottom. Frontiersmen tended to view these Dunkards with suspicion because of their pacifism, their proficiency in the French language (some were Alsatians), their friendship with the Indians, and their practice of aiding deserters and wounded Indians.</p>

   <p>The wagon with the salt and other supplies had not arrived in Fort Dinwiddie on 3 Nov. but had done so before the end of the month.</p>

   <p>For GWs accusations about Joseph Chews servant, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-02-02-0241" class="document">his letter to Hog of 27 Dec. 1755</a>. It is unclear precisely why and how she left Chews service in Alexandria and was on her wayapparently from Fort Cumberlandto Philadelphia when Hog persuaded her to return to Wills Creek after he learned of Braddocks defeat on 18 July. The implication is that she accompanied
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-02-02-pb-0303">[303]</span>
some of the officers who were staying at Chews tavern when the expedition got underway. Mr. Stalker is probably Peter Stalker of Alexandria, and Mr. Allen may be James Allen, an ensign in the British army, who in April 1755 was given the task of drilling the raw Virginia recruits at Alexandria.</p>

   <p>Lt. Thomas McManus and Capt. Edward Brice Dobbs were officers in the North Carolina detachment sent to participate in Braddocks campaign.</p>
