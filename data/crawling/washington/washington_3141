So that on the whole My Dr Sir I would advise You by all means to strictly follow the Steps of the Law that your title afture Obtaining it may be Proof aganst the Artifices of Designing Men. I have wrote by Mr Young to Colo. Preston and desired him in case he should think you and himself unsafe in immediately signing a certificat of the Work as done by Mr Crawford to Order one of his surveyers as they go down to the Ohio to survey the Lands by the Works You have sent him and to send you the certificat so that you may have it at Williamsburg. Apriel the 14th day is the time Advertised in the Gazet for the Diffrant Claiments to met the Surveyers at the Mouth of the Great Kanawa, so that by all Probability an Oppertunity will offer of sending the Field work to Colo. Preston so that You may have the Certificat as above.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-09-02-0381-fn-0006" id="GEWN-02-09-02-0381-fn-0006-ptr">6</a> As soon as I see the Clark of this County I shall direct him to apply to the Aprl Court for we have no Court this month, for an Order to Value Your Improvements.

but whether the Court will Issue it Blank or not is the doubt, it is customary to Name the Persons in the Order. but a still greater Objection stands in the way. that of having the Men who Makes the Valuation sworen by a Majestrate of this County, and indeed I do not at Present know of any that will be in that quarter about that time. If no such Opportunity should offer it would be best, to have the Men sworn before A Justice at Fort Pitt as I understand there are several in that quarter added to the dedemos of Augusta. This would not be exactly according to Law but it is the Only remedde I can think of.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-09-02-0381-fn-0007" id="GEWN-02-09-02-0381-fn-0007-ptr">7</a></p>
<p>For sume days past we have had repeted advices by travolars that the Creeks Cherokees &amp; Chocktaws have Joined in a war aganst Our Southeran Provences, that a Number of familys were cut off that since that first strock several Battles have been fought in the most of which the Indians had the Advantage. At first I payed but little regard to those reports. but since I wrote the Above I am from certant Infermation persweded that it is a Melancoly truth several Persons who has been Eye Witnesses of the dredfull effects of Savage Cruelty, &amp; they further add that five-hundred Creeks are at this time amongst the Cherokees prepared to make a stroke, but where no person can tell. so allarming is the Accts that Our Settlers on the Holston &amp; other Rivers in that quarter are Forting up &amp; scouts are Keept out to watch the approch of the Enemie. Indeed I am afread that the Ohio Indians are in the Plot at least I am confident that they were acquented of the designs of the Southeran Indians. And that nothing deters them from Joining the others but theire being so Near Neghbours to Our Settlements below Fort Pitt. They ought to be strictly watched from Fort Pitt &amp; if it can be discovered that they are about to Move theire familys they may be expected Open Enemies. If those troubles encress or even continue it will put a stop to Our designs On the Ohio. I was Obleged to Lay aside this Letter for an houer or two in Order to Make the Governor Acqueanted with the Reports. as Capt. Russell of Fincastle is on his way in behalf of Our Holston Settlements.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-09-02-0381-fn-0008" id="GEWN-02-09-02-0381-fn-0008-ptr">8</a></p>

<p>I hop to be able to discharge the Acct you inclosed Me on Our Meeting in May at which time I shall mention my thoughts as to the Manner Mr Crawford has Layed of Our Lands Sume of us has suffered exceedingly by the takeing in bad Lands with out his being under the Least Necessity of so doing only that the Surveying it to Advantage would have taken a little more time &amp; trouble, I<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-09-02-0381-fn-0009" id="GEWN-02-09-02-0381-fn-0009-ptr">9</a> shall be more particuler When I see You.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-09-02-0381-fn-0010" id="GEWN-02-09-02-0381-fn-0010-ptr">10</a> I heartely wish that John Smiths Lot which I payed him for had been Patented in my Name or reather that I had been Mentioned in the Patent as Assignee of John Smith.

   <p>Rinds <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Virginia Gazette</span> (Williamsburg) reported on 17 Mar.: By a gentleman just arrived from New River, in Fincastle county, we are informed that about 40 families were lately murdered on the Okonees [Oconee River in Georgia] by the Indians. Captain Russell, from the same county, who a few days ago came to this city [Williamsburg], reports, that the people are in the most dreadful consternation, on account of the outrages committed by those savage people. This Indian outbreak in Georgia was reported in more detail in Rinds newspaper on 31 Mar. and 7 April, but Rind declared the reports to be greatly exaggerated. Purdie and Dixons <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Virginia Gazette</span> (Williamsburg), on the other hand, viewed the threat as much more serious (24, 31 Mar., 7 April). The attack seems to have been made by a few Creek and Cherokee whose actions were denounced by the leaders of their tribes. Two Georgia families were killed on Christmas Day and a Georgia militia officer was captured and tortured to death. Capt.
