   <p>It is not known whether Roger Tandy replaced James Biggs. Biggs was probably the James Biggs whose will was probated in 1778 in Northampton County on the Eastern Shore.</p>

   <p>For Hills earlier reference to this land dispute, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-09-02-0171" class="document">Hill to GW, 11 May</a>. Old Standers were persons of long standing in a profession or place. Old Colo. Custis was John Custis (1653c.1714) of Hungars, great-grandfather of John Parke Custis and father of John Custis of Williamsburg and Queens Creek. Custis Kendall was the son of William Kendall II (d. 1709) and his wife Sorrowful Margaret Custis Kendall, sister of John Custis of Williamsburg and Queens Creek. Southy Nelson (died c.1781) married Elizabeth Willett, the great-granddaughter of William Willett, original claimant of the land.</p>

   <p>This may be Billy, or Will, Lee but is probably one of the slaves from the York River plantation. A 25year-old slave named Little Will lived at the Great House plantation in 1771 (account of the slaves at the Great House, 20 Dec. 1771, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Virginia Historical Society, Richmond ]">ViHi</span>: Custis Papers).</p>
