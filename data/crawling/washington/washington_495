<p>When I was down the Committee among other things resolved that the Maryland and Carolina Companies shoud not be supported with our ProvisionsThis Resolve (I think) met with your Approbation; upon which I wrote to Colo.

   <p>Horatio Sharpe wrote to Cecilius Calvert on 6 Oct. 1755: The Garrison at that place [Fort Cumberland] consists of about 150 effective Men who since the Departure of Coll Innes to Carolina are I expect under the Command of Capt.

Robert Hunter Morris of Pennsylvania, Sharpe referred to Capt. Dagworthy who commands the Garrison consisting of 137 Men at Fort Cumberland (ibid., 292). Dinwiddie wrote Sharpe, 2 Jan. 1756, I think its absurd in him to expect to Comd the Forces of this Dominion or to have rank before Colo. Washington (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Virginia Historical Society, Richmond ]">ViHi</span>: Dinwiddie Papers). Before receiving Dinwiddies letter but after having talked in New York to William Shirley, who knew all about the controversy, Sharpe wrote Dinwiddie on 4 Jan.: Upon hearing that Colo Washington excepted agst Capt Dagworthys acting as Commander in Chief at Wills-Creek by virtue of His Majestys Commission I sent him Orders to confine himself to the command of the Fort alone &amp; not interfere with any Troops in the Barracks or assume any Authority over the Virginians that should be there Posted

   <p>Sharpe met with Shirley and other colonial governors and military men in New York in December.</p>

   <p>When writing Shirley on 4 Nov. 1755 about GWs problems with Dagworthy, Dinwiddie suggested that Shirley issue brevet commissions to GW, Lt. Col. Adam Stephen, and Maj. Andrew Lewis of the Virginia Regiment, thereby removing any doubts about their outranking the Maryland captain. In his letter to Shirley dated 24 Jan. 1756 explaining the purpose of GWs mission to Boston to see Shirley, Dinwiddie again asked for brevet commissions but then wrote: The Offs. of our Forces have addressd Yr Exy to be brot on B[ritish] Establishmt and prayd me to recommend it; as this is an affair entirely with You, I can say nothing further than that (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Virginia Historical Society, Richmond ]">ViHi</span>: Dinwiddie Papers). As early as the fall of 1754 Dinwiddie had asked the secretary of state of the Southern Department that blank Commiss[ion]s [be] sent out to me to fill up as was done on the Expedition to Carthagena (Dinwiddie to Sir Thomas Robinson, 25 Oct. 1754, ibid.). The officers memorial has not been found.</p>

   <p>Capt. James Mercer (17161757) was the younger brother of John Mercer of Marlborough in Stafford County, and therefore uncle to captains George and John Fenton Mercer of the Virginia Regiment. He received a captaincy for the Cartagena campaign in 1740 and served in the 48th Regiment of Foot during the Braddock campaign. He died in Albany, N.Y., in 1757. He is sometimes confused with Lt. Col. James F. Mercer of Sir William Pepperrells regiment, who was killed at Oswego in 1756. George and John Fenton Mercer also had a brother named James Mercer (1735/61793), who became a leading citizen of Fredericksburg and a burgess representing Hampshire County.</p>

   <p>John Rutherfurd (17121758) got his commission in the British army in 1741 in exchange for his opposition seat in Parliament. Arriving in New York in 1742, Rutherfurd settled in Albany as captain of an independent company of the regular army and 3 years later took his seat on the New York Council, a position he held until his death. He became a major in the Royal American Regiment in 1756. For his role as captain of the independent company sent from New York to Virginia for the campaign of the summer of 1754, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-01-02-0077&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-01-02-0077-fn-0002#GEWN-02-01-02-0077-fn-0002" class="document">William Fairfax to GW, 5 July 1754, n.2</a>.</p>

   <p>On 14 Dec. 1755 Dinwiddie suggested that GW ask Dagworthy if he did not Command by virtue of Governor Sharpes Commission and thereby make clear your Commission from me is greater than what he has.</p>
