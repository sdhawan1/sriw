<p>A few days ago I with inexpressible pleasure receivd your Affectionate &amp; most obliging favour of the 30th July from Mount Vernon.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-06-02-0191-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-06-02-0191-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> Im sorry that the Noble Profession of Arms, so much revered in all Ages, is become the Subject of Redicule to the most ignorant &amp; foolish Tattlers &amp; news mongers amongst the Mob; tho its no small alleviation of the intended Injury, that these vain Speculative Arbiters of Military actions, can neither add to, nor diminish from, their intrinsick value; which will always be ascribd to them by the knowing &amp; Judicious part of Mankind, and from them receive the grateful acknowledgements &amp; just Tribute due to genuine Merit. I flattrd myself that our distance from the Inhabitants, would have prevented, Bullets Affair from being exhibited amongst them in that Light in which its generally beheld in this Army, where its talkd off in such a manner that some of our Officers have refusd to Rank

with him; A Court of Enquiry is soon to sit on it, which most imagine will only be a Prelude to a General Court Martial; I wish to God for his sake &amp; that of the Corps it may turn out very differently from what many think it will.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-06-02-0191-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-06-02-0191-fn-0002-ptr">2</a></p>
<p>We have here besides the Artillery, the 1st Battn of R[oyal] A[merican]s, 656 R[ank] &amp; F[ile] of ours, part of our Artificers and about 80 Pens., the rest of our Artificers and the 1st Battn of Pens. are daily expected; and by the great pains the General has taken, his indefaticable application to Business &amp; constant regard to the Interest of the Service, we seem to run no risque of wanting, &amp; will be able to maintain a respectable Garrison at this place in the Winter. The Troops here are incessantly employed on the Works, expediting which, engages the Generals closest attention; he himself overlooks them every Day (sundays not excepted) almost from Reville to Retreat Beating; and as many Guards as are now become unecessary, very few are Mounted, and these Releivd but once a week. This Fort, which is yet but in embryo, will when finishd, be the grandest that has yet been in this new World, but it will require much Time great perseverence and immense Labour: The Engineers &amp; indeed almost everybody else, are so extremely Bussie that I cannot for some Time possibly procure a proper Plann of it, but that you may form some Idea of it I inclose you a Rough Sketch, done with a Pencil &amp; without Rule &amp;Ca and so soon as I can get a proper one, will do myself the pleasure of transmitting it to you; its hopd the three Bastions on the Land side and all the Barracks will be finishd this year and the rest will be Stockaded till next Spring.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-06-02-0191-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-06-02-0191-fn-0003-ptr">3</a></p>
<p>Our Camp at present resembles a Military Colony, where Labour, Industry and Arms, go hand &amp; hand; you cant cast your Eyes any where, without seeing, Tradesmen &amp; handicrafts of various kinds at work, and often the same Men alternatively Soldiers &amp; Mechanicks, this hightned by a view of three glorious Rivers, and the many Beauties Nature has been so lavish in adorning this place and its Environs, forms a most delightfull Prospect, terminated by high romantic Mountains, which nearly encircle it: in fine the more I see of this Charming Country, the more Im enamourd with it, which leads me to enquire after what Steps have been taken, in secureing to us, those Lands which poor Capn Gist was to have enterd for us, I hope

<p>The Indians not only of this Voisinage, but of several remote Nations beyond the Lakes, are of the best Disposition towards us &amp; sincerely inclind to enter into &amp; cultivate a strict &amp; permanent Freindship with us, they have already brought us near Fifty of their Captives &amp; Promise to Deliver up the whole at a Grand Treaty to be held here in about three weeks<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-06-02-0191-fn-0005" id="GEWN-02-06-02-0191-fn-0005-ptr">5</a>We find the Ohio Indians, (composd of Scatterd &amp; Detachd Parties from different Tribes) to be much more numerous than they ever were thought to be, notwithstanding the great Loss they acknowledge to have sustaind on our Fronteers, These calld Delawares, are now eight hundred fightg men, which is accounted for by their Junction with the little Tribes, that at different Times went from the interior Settlements of our Provinces; the Shawaneese are likewise more powerfull than we imagind, tho we cannot yet exactly ascertain their Numbers; Both those Nations are greatly incensd against you, who they call the Great Knife &amp; look on you to be author of their greatest misfortunes; the Delawares confess they had 50 of their best Warriors Killd and many disabled, the Shawaneese have also had a very considerable Loss, they have between them just Detachd 64 Warriors agt the Cherrokees, which at this Juncture may be productive of very desireable consequences. If it is true that the Creeks &amp; Cherrokees have enterd into a League against us, I tremble for our Southern Colonies! as from what the Ohio Indians have done, we may easily conceive, what the united Force of such Warlike &amp; Formidable Nations can effect to our prejudice<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-06-02-0191-fn-0006" id="GEWN-02-06-02-0191-fn-0006-ptr">6</a>In the mean Time we here enjoy Peace and tranquillity, and the Pens. ever attentive to Gain &amp; tenatious of their Interest, carry on an extensive and most advantagious Furr Trade with the Savages, conducted under such prudent Regulations, as cannot fael of Success &amp; producing immense Fortunes, so easy a Road to attaining which, is now so plainly pointed out, that Im astonishd our Province remain dormant and inactive, we certainly have many public Spirited Gentn and some of them who must have an Inclination to advance the Interest of their Country by encreasing their private Fortunes, What can be the reason that none of them embraces so favourable an opportunity of accomplishing so desireable an End?<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-06-02-0191-fn-0007" id="GEWN-02-06-02-0191-fn-0007-ptr">7</a></p>

   <p>Maj. Gen. John Stanwix arrived at Pittsburgh at the end of August 1759, and on 3 Sept. his engineer Capt. Harry Gordon initiated work on the permanent fort, Fort Pitt. Stewart probably left Fort Ligonier in Pennsylvania with Lt. Col. Adam Stephen on 18 Sept., arriving at Pittsburgh with supplies and

   <p>With the aid of the old Indian hands George Croghan and William Trent, General Stanwix held a meeting with representatives of the Ottawa, Twightwee, Wyandot, Shawnee, and Delaware Indians in late October 1759. The purpose of the meeting was to confirm the terms of the settlement that Gen. John Forbes reached with some of these at Easton in 1758, effectively ending the French-Indian alliance in the Ohio country.</p>

   <p>A precarious peace between the Cherokee and the whites in Carolina was maintained until war broke out in 1760. The Creek nation remained neutral at that time, in part due to the efforts of Gov. Henry Ellis of Georgia.</p>
