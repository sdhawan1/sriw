   <p>At the council of war which met on 8 May, Lee announced his impending departure for North Carolina and urged the attending officers to digest some plan for the safety and security of Virginia during his absence. The council decided that as strong a force as possible ought to be stationed at Williamsburg and its dependencies and that large garrisons should be maintained at Great Bridge and Suffolk. The post at Kemps Landing to the east of Great Bridge was to be abandoned, however, and the Virginia convention was to be asked to order slaves of military age and disaffected white inhabitants to be evacuated from large portions of Princess Anne and Norfolk counties (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>; see also <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William J.

   <p>The Virginia convention resolved on this date to raise 1,150 minutemen and militia to assist North Carolina. This order was countermanded on 29 May after the convention was told that Gen. Henry Clintons force had left Cape Fear (ibid., 8889, 299, 301).</p>

   <p>An amusette or wall gun was a huge weapon, shaped like an ordinary musket but so big it could almost be considered heavy ordnance. Mounted on a swivel, it was an ideal weapon for a hastily erected fort or for a small boat. It was lighter than a cannon, but its range and striking power were infinitely greater than those of the usual musket or rifle (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Harold L.

   <p>The Virginia convention planned to debate the question of independence on this date, but other business obliged it to postpone that issue to 14 May. After debating the matter for two days, the convention unanimously agreed on 15 May to instruct the colonys delegates in Philadelphia to propose to Congress that it declare the United Colonies free and independent states (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William J.

   <p>Robert Eden (17411784), the affable governor of Maryland with whom GW had exchanged social visits before the Revolutionary War, enjoyed cordial relations with the Patriots in his colony before the interception on 6 April of three letters written to him the previous November and December by Lord George Germain, the recently appointed secretary of state for the American colonies. Perhaps the most damaging of these letters was one of 23 Dec. 1775 in which Germain told Eden: Your Letter [of 27 Aug. to Lord Dartmouth] contains a great deal of very useful Information, and your confidential Communication of the Characters of Individuals; more especially of such as come over into England, is of great Advantage; and you may rest assured, that every possible precaution will be used, that no part of your Letter shall transpire (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William J.

   <p>James Barron, the Virginia naval captain who seized the letters on 6 April from a small vessel in the Chesapeake Bay, delivered them that same day to the Virginia committee of safety, which promptly dispatched copies to the Baltimore committee of observation (ibid., 6:34243, 346; <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Virginia Gazette</span> [Purdie; Williamsburg], 12 April 1776). The Baltimore committee in turn forwarded copies of the three letters to the Continental Congress and appointed a delegation to carry other copies to the Maryland council of safety in Annapolis and to use their utmost Endeavours to have Governor Eden put under Arrest (Baltimore committee to the Virginia committee of safety, 17 April 1776, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William J.

   <p>The Maryland council of safety was annoyed that Lee and the Virginia committee of safety did not write directly to it about the intercepted letters, and it became infuriated when it was accidentally revealed in Congress on 16 April that Purviance had impressed on Genl Lee, in his way to Virga., an Idea that the Council of Safety was timorous and inactive (Thomas Johnson to the council of safety, 17 April 1776, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Paul H.

Council of Safety, 11:36870). On 6 May Lee sent a disingenuous letter of apology to the president of the Maryland council of safety, Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer. My reason for addressing myself to Mr. Purviance at Baltimore, he wrote, proceeded entirely from my ignorance of there being any Troops at Annapolis, and not (as I have been told has been thrown out) from any diffidence in your virtue and decision. He had thought, Lee asserted, that troops were stationed only at Baltimore, and there being no Continental general in Maryland, he had applied to Purviance who was on the spot. Lee vigorously denied any desire to extend the military authority or of trespassing on the Civil. . . . altho I was bred in the army, I thank God, the spirit of the citizen has been always predominant, and I solemnly declare that if I thought it possible that I should ever be intoxicated with military command, I woud now whilst I retain my senses, beg leave to divest myself of my present office and serve as a Volunteer (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ [[Charles Lee]]. &lt;i&gt;The Lee Papers&lt;/i&gt;. 4 vols.

   <p>Lees account for captains William Smith, Ezra Lunt, and James Grier has not been identified. James Grier (d. 1803) and his party of Pennsylvania riflemen were detached to serve as Lees personal guard when Lee left Cambridge for New York in January, and they subsequently followed him to Virginia despite having to leave about fifty men at York, Pa., to be inoculated after smallpox broke out in the unit (Lee to Grier, 8 April 1776, <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ [[Charles Lee]]. &lt;i&gt;The Lee Papers&lt;/i&gt;. 4 vols.

When Grier set out on his return to the north sometime later this month, he probably carried the brief letter that Lee wrote to GW on 11 May recommending Grier to his protection (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>). Grier was at Philadelphia on 12 June when Congress ordered him to march his men on to New York, and the next day he was authorized to draw $600 from the treasury to cover the detachments expenses (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington Chauncey Ford et al., eds. &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789&lt;/i&gt;. 34 vols.

Grier, who had been commissioned first lieutenant of a Pennsylvania rifle company in June 1775, became a captain in the 1st Continental Regiment on 7 Mar. 1776. He served with that regiment during the remainder of 1776 and with the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment the following year. Wounded at the Battle of Brandywine in September 1777, Grier soon recovered and was promoted to major. He remained in the army until the end of the war, serving in various Pennsylvania regiments. Ezra Lunt (17361804) was a captain in Col.

   <p>Christian Holmer (d. 1783) was commissioned major of Col. Charles Harrisons 1st Continental Artillery Regiment on 30 Nov. 1776, but he was passed over for promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1779 because, as GW regretfully informed the Board of War on 18 May 1779, his qualifications as an officer were generally judged to be far below mediocrity (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>). John Skey Eustace, the fifteen-year-old former ward of Lord Dunmore who had sought to join the Continental army since his capture by the Americans the previous December, wrote to Lee from New York on 21 Mar. 1776: As . . . I am at present unprovided for I woud esteem it as a singular favor, if you woud honor me with an epistle, and let me know in what manner to proceed, as I at present look upon you as my patron. I woud rather remain Idle for some time than do anything without or contrary to your immediate desire (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ [[Charles Lee]]. &lt;i&gt;The Lee Papers&lt;/i&gt;. 4 vols.

On 20 June 1776 Col. James Mitchell Varnum wrote Nathanael Greene asking that Greene recommend Eustace to GW for an ensigncy in Varnums 9th Continental Regiment, and Greene in an undated note to GW written on Varnums letter requested GW to make the appointment (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D.C. ]">DNA</span>: <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Record Group (designating the location of documents in the National Archives) ]">RG</span> 93, Miscellaneous Numbered Records [Manuscript File], 177584, no. 15637). Eustace presumably was commissioned an ensign a short time later, and in October, after Lee returned to the north, he became one of his aides-de-camp.</p>
