   <p>John Smith was at Mount Vernon on 22 Oct. on his way to Frederick County court where he intended to secure permission from the local magistrate to inoculate Samuel Washington and his family but died before he could do it. Smith lived for many years at Shooters Hill, Middlesex County, the home of his wife Mary Jacquelin Smith (17141764). In 1767 Smith returned to Northumberland County and established a smallpox hospital at his old
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-08-02-pb-0570">[570]</span>
home, Fleets Bay. He was accused of having caused several outbreaks of smallpox by not quarantining patients for a long enough time.</p>

   <p>By Glostonians, GW probably means men of Gloucester County in the Tidewater. The Warner mentioned here is probably Warner Washingtons son Warner (17511789) who had the previous year married Mary Whiting of Gloucester County. He by this time may have been living in his new home Clifton, three quarters of a mile north of his fathers Fairfield, in Frederick County.</p>

   <p>GW may be referring to Charles Washingtons Frederick County lands, to which he moved from Fredericksburg in 1780.</p>

   <p>Anthony Gholson rented a 113-acre parcel of GWs Frederick County land above Worthingtons Marsh from 1768 until at least as late as 1786. Rental was set at 4 a year. Gholson did not make his first payment until 19 Oct. 1772, at which time he paid 18.15.0 to cover his arrears through 1771 (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Manuscript Ledger Book 1, 1750-72, in George Washington Papers, Library of Congress. ]">Ledger A</span>, 305; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Manuscript Ledger Book 2, 1772-93, in George Washington Papers, Library of Congress. ]">Ledger B</span>, 31; Frederick County Deed Book, 22 Mar. 1769, pp. 1012). David Kennedy rented a part of GWs Bullskin lands in Frederick County from 1766 to 1773. At the end of 1772, he owed GW 178, more than six years of back rent. In 1773 and 1774, GW received from George Johnston in payment for Kennedy a total of 153.15.11, leaving only one years rent due (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Manuscript Ledger Book 1, 1750-72, in George Washington Papers, Library of Congress. ]">Ledger A</span>, 248; <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Manuscript Ledger Book 2, 1772-93, in George Washington Papers, Library of Congress. ]">Ledger B</span>, 22). On 4 April 1787 Kennedy gave GW the following promissory note: I acknowledge the above Balance due General Washington of Twenty Eight pounds which I Promise to Pay with Interest From this Date (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Princeton University, Princeton, N.J. ]">NjP</span>:De Coppet Collection).

During the Revolution until his death in 1781, Samuel Washington received much of what rent GWs tenants in Frederick or Berkeley counties paid (see <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Manuscript Ledger Book 2, 1772-93, in George Washington Papers, Library of Congress. ]">Ledger B</span>, 22, 31, 32, 72).</p>

The land appeared on his quitrent list for the first time in 1763. Mr. Wormley is Ralph Wormeley and Mr. Alexander is Garrard Alexander. Mr. Keith is probably James Keith (17341824), clerk of the Frederick County court. See Northern Neck Grant Book K, 98, 7 April 1760.
