   <p>Dr. Robert James (17051776) of London took out a patent for his popular fever powder in Nov. 1746. Composed primarily of phosphate of lime and oxide of antimony, it was sold and widely used over the next hundred years as a cure for high temperatures and inflammatory pains of all kinds. Jamess powder is my panacea, Horace Walpole wrote Horace Mann on 21 Oct. 1764. I have such faith in this powder, that I believe I should take it if the house was on fire (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ W.

   <p>Braddock left GW on the morning of 23 June at Bear Camp, about 21 miles from Georges Creek and about 11 miles from Little Meadows.

   <p>The physicians with the advanced detachment of Braddocks army were Dr. Robert McKinley, the surgeon for the 44th Regiment; Dr. James Napier, director of the general hospital; and Dr. Adair and Dr. Swinton, who were apparently assistants to Dr. Napier.</p>

   <p>For the past week small parties of French and Indians had shadowed Braddocks force, testing its security and killing a few unfortunates who ventured beyond the sentry lines without adequate protection. Other enemy parties had appeared on the frontier in the vicinity of Fort Cumberland and had killed several settlers, spreading panic among the inhabitants of Frederick and Hampshire counties.</p>

   <p>The first brigade commanded by Sir Peter Halkett arrived at Little Meadows on 16 June, but two very long steep Hills prevented the second brigade under Colonel Dunbar from reaching the camp there until the next morning (The Journal of a British Officer, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Charles Hamilton, ed. &lt;i&gt;Braddocks Defeat&lt;/i&gt;.

By then it was indeed apparent to all that the problems of moving an army through the North American wilderness had not yet been solved. In crossing Allegheny Mountain west of Georges Creek on 15 June, three wagons were, according to Robert Orme, intirely demolished and several shattered. During the day the line was sometimes extended to a length of four or five miles despite vigorous efforts to keep it closed up. When matters did not greatly improve the next day, the facts had to be faced. It was found impossible, Orme wrote, to proceed with such a number of carriages. The horses grew every day fainter, and many died: and the men would not have been able to have undergone the constant and necessary fatigue, by remaining so many hours under arms; and by the great extent of the baggage the line was extremely weakned (Captain Ormes Journal, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Winthrop Sargent, ed. &lt;i&gt;The History of an Expedition against Fort Du Quesne, in 1755; under Major-General Edward Braddock, Generalissimo of H.B.M.

indicate that Braddocks engineers had been able to bridge the diminished river there to facilitate the passage of the artillery. When Robert Orme was at the Great Crossing with Braddock on 24 June, he observed that the Youghiogheny was about one hundred yards wide, about three feet deep, with a very strong current (Captain Ormes Journal, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Winthrop Sargent, ed. &lt;i&gt;The History of an Expedition against Fort Du Quesne, in 1755; under Major-General Edward Braddock, Generalissimo of H.B.M.

The drought did not prevent the French from moving supplies by their well-established water route from Montreal to Fort Duquesne, but it did greatly hinder their efforts, particularly along Le Boeuf Creek. Le Boeuf Creek was a tributary of French Creek that formed a major part of the link between Presque Isle on Lake Erie and the waters of French Creek, at the mouth of which lay the important French outpost Venango (now Franklin, Pa.). Many of the reinforcements intended for Fort Duquesne had to be temporarily diverted to the Le Boeuf Creek area to help hasten much needed supplies down that stream and French Creek to Venango and thence by the Allegheny River to Fort Duquesne.</p>

   <p>Thomas Gage (c.17191787), who as commander in chief of the British army in America from 1763 to 1775 was to play an important role in the coming of the Revolution, was at this time lieutenant colonel of the 44th Regiment, a position that he had held since 2 Mar. 1751. The second son of an Irish peer, he entered the army sometime between 1736 and 1740 and fought at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 and at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. Gage led the vanguard of Braddocks advanced division from Little Meadows on 18 June 1755 and was leading it on 9 July when the French and Indians attacked the column. In the subsequent fighting he narrowly escaped death. I received, he wrote the earl of Albemarle on 24 July, a slight wound in my belly . . . , a graze of a slugg on my eye brow, some shots in my coat, and my horse twice wounded (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Richard Alden. &lt;i&gt;General Gage in America&lt;/i&gt;.

During the campaign GW and Gage developed a cordial friendship that lasted for several years, and as late as 1773 the two men met on apparently polite terms in New York. Two years later, however, they found themselves commanding opposing armies at the siege of Boston.</p>

   <p>Braddocks advanced division marched from Little Meadows in two parts. A vanguard of about 400 or 450 officers and men under Lieutenant Colonel Gage set out with Sir John St. Clair on the morning of 18 June to cut roads. The main body of about 750 or 800 officers and men left with Braddock the next day. Gages vanguard included 150 or 200 rank and file from the 44th and 48th regiments, 50 rank and file from Capt. Horatio Gatess New York Independent Company, five Virginia light horsemen, Capt. Thomas Waggeners and Capt. William La Pronies companies of Virginia rangers, and Capt. William Polsons company of Virginia carpenters. The main body consisted of the senior grenadier company from each of the two regiments, an additional 500 or 550 rank and file from the regiments, Lt. Charles Spendelows detachment of seamen, and 18 Virginia light horsemen. All men taken from the two regiments were supposed to be Old Standers, veterans

who had come with the regiments from Ireland and not provincials recently recruited to fill up the ranks (The Journal of a British Officer, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Charles Hamilton, ed. &lt;i&gt;Braddocks Defeat&lt;/i&gt;. Norman, Okla., 1959. ]">Hamilton, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Braddocks Defeat</span></span>, 42). Only two women per company were allowed to march with the advanced division rather than the previously allowed six for each regular company and four for each provincial company. The provisions, enough for 30 to 40 days, were loaded almost entirely on packhorses although three or four provision wagons also accompanied the advanced division.</p>

   <p>The carriages included the wheeled artillery pieces, ammunition carts, tool wagons, the three or four provision wagons, and a wagon loaded with gifts for Indians. Robert Orme said in his journal that there were about thirty carriages in the advanced division (Captain Ormes Journal, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Winthrop Sargent, ed. &lt;i&gt;The History of an Expedition against Fort Du Quesne, in 1755; under Major-General Edward Braddock, Generalissimo of H.B.M.

Engineer Harry Gordon reported 33 or 34 carriages (Gordon to , 23 July 1755, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Stanley Pargellis, ed. &lt;i&gt;Military Affairs in North America, 17481765: Selected Documents from the Cumberland Papers in Windsor Castle&lt;/i&gt;. 1936.

Norman, Okla., 1959. ]">Hamilton, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Braddocks Defeat</span></span>, 43). Braddock took with him all four of his 8inch howitzers, his four 12pounders, two of the four 6pounders that remained with the army after two 6pounders were sent back to Fort Cumberland from Spendelows Camp, and 3 of the remaining 11 Coehorn mortars. Nine horses were assigned to each howitzer, seven to each 12pounder, and six to each wagon. Each 6pounder was probably pulled by four to six horses. The mortars were carried on wagons.</p>

   <p>Despite all of the changes in the line of march, Braddocks decision to keep most of his artillery with the advanced division left him no choice but to continue building roadways adequate to accommodate the big guns in the wilderness terrain. We Came on Extreamly well, Considering the Difficulty of making the roads, said Harry Gordon (Gordon to , 23 July 1755, in Pargellis, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Milita, y Affairs in North America</span>, 1049). On 19 June Robert Orme reported that the main body of the advanced division covered only four miles before it caught up with Gages vanguard. There they had to camp for the night, as the road builders were then at work in cutting a travers-road over an immense mountain [Negro Mountain], which could not be finished till the next day. On 20 June the detachment marched 7 to 9 miles over a chain of very rocky mountains and difficult passes to Bear Camp. We could not reach our ground, said Orme, till about 7 of the clock, which was three hours later than common, as there was no water, nor even earth enough to fix a tent, between the great Mountain and this place. We halted here two days, having a road to cut in the side of a mountain [Winding Ridge], and some swamps to make passable (Captain Ormes Journal, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Winthrop Sargent, ed. &lt;i&gt;The History of an Expedition against Fort Du Quesne, in 1755; under Major-General Edward Braddock, Generalissimo of H.B.M.

Meadows. This incident and the ample other signs of the enemys presence in the area induced the soldiers to carry out the generals detailed orders for posting camp guards with great alacrity and dispatch. It also convinced them that his insistence on having flanking parties when marching was not an unnecessary fatigue as they had earlier thought, but their only security instead (Captain Ormes Journal, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Winthrop Sargent, ed. &lt;i&gt;The History of an Expedition against Fort Du Quesne, in 1755; under Major-General Edward Braddock, Generalissimo of H.B.M.

No further casualties were incurred until 6 July when three or four stragglers were killed. Frequent alarms, however, clearly continued to occur. To prevent such alarms from being too disruptive, Braddock gave orders on the evening of 25 June that the line is never to turn out upon any account but by order from the General, or the field officer of the picket (ibid., 343). At the same time he offered a reward of 5 to anyone who brought in the scalp of a hostile Indian.</p>

   <p>Colonel Dunbar had been left with about 800 men and, according to his estimate, approximately 150 wagons and 300 packloads of bread flower and Bacon, but only enough horses to furnish two thirds of the Waggons with four each and for back loads . . . as many as would take About One half of the provissions. Given no hope of further aid by Braddock, Dunbar was obliged to move his division in stages, marching one day with everything that could be carried, while a small party guarded the remaining wagons and provisions, and then at night sending the horses back to bring up the second load the next day. A third and sometimes fourth day was required to rest the exhausted horses, which Dunbar found to be very bad and Weak, the worst of the entire army (Dunbar to Robert Napier, 24 July 1755, in <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Stanley Pargellis, ed. &lt;i&gt;Military Affairs in North America, 17481765: Selected Documents from the Cumberland Papers in Windsor Castle&lt;/i&gt;. 1936.

   <p>The provision detachment, commanded by Capt. Adam Stephen, arrived at Braddocks camp on 5 July with about 100 oxen and a large quantity of flour loaded on packhorses. GW did not reach the general until 8 July. He was still too weak to ride a long distance on horseback and had to make the trip to the front in a covered wagon, which certainly moved more slowly over the rough new road than did the oxen and packhorses. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-01-02-0164" class="document">GW Memorandum, 89 July 1755</a>. At Scalping Camp today GW paid 8s. for 8 days attendance of a Nurse in my Sickness. Two days later he spent 5s. 9d. for milk and 9s. for three pairs of hobbles (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Manuscript Ledger Book 1, 1750-72, in George Washington Papers, Library of Congress. ]">Ledger A</span>, 22, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>).</p>

   <p>Robert Ormes letter has not been found. It was probably written on the evening of 29 June, the day the advanced division crossed the Youghiogheny at Stewarts Crossing, or the next day when the division rested on the east bank of the river.</p>
