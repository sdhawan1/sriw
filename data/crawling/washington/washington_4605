   <p>This unsigned letter was probably written by John Allan (17471805), a prominent advocate of the American cause in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. Allans parents brought him to Nova Scotia from Scotland in 1749 or 1750. As a youth he was apparently educated in Massachusetts, and in 1767 he married into one of the many New England families that had settled in Nova Scotia. During 1775 Allan and Jonathan Eddy began organizing resistance to the royal government in western Nova Scotia. Their hopes for an insurrection in early 1776 were disappointed when it became clear that most of their fellow citizens were unwilling to take up arms without military assistance from New England. It was to obtain that assistance that Eddy carried this letter and the Nova Scotia petition of this date to GW. For Eddys meeting with GW, see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-03-03-02-0409-0001" class="document">GW to Hancock, 27 Mar. 1776</a>. Referred to Congress by GW, Eddy went to Philadelphia but could not convince the delegates to send a liberating army to Nova Scotia. In August 1776 Allan set out on a similar mission apparently hoping to succeed where Eddy had failed. On 22 Dec. 1776 Allan discussed his plan for attacking Nova Scotia with GW at his headquarters in Pennsylvania, and two weeks later he presented his scheme to Congress then meeting in Baltimore. Congress recommended to the Massachusetts council on 8 Jan. 1777 that 3,000 men be raised for an expedition to Nova Scotia, and on 15 Jan. Congress appointed Allan superintendent of the eastern Indians (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington Chauncey Ford et al., eds. &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789&lt;/i&gt;. 34 vols.

The Massachusetts authorities offered Allan little support, however, and he raised only a few men for his expedition. In the summer of 1777 Allan tried to establish a post on the St. <span class="choice correction" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover_choice ] header=[]  body=[ Corrected from 'Johns' &lt;span style='font-size: 90%'&gt;[[2010-02-24]]&lt;/span&gt; ]">John</span> River in present-day New Brunswick with his small force, but the arrival of a flotilla of British warships obliged him to retreat. Allan served as superintendent of the eastern Indians for the remainder of the war and was instrumental in keeping the British out of eastern Maine. He settled in Maine in 1784.</p>

   <p>The special session of the Nova Scotia assembly that Gov. Francis Legge (c.17191783) called in the fall of 1775 passed an act requiring one-fifth of the militia to be drafted into a regiment for the defense of the colony and another act imposing a tax for the support of that force. Several outlying areas of Nova Scotia, including Cumberland County, objected to these laws and petitioned the governor for their suspension. For excerpts from Cumberland Countys petition of 2223 Dec. 1775, see <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ John Bartlet Brebner. &lt;i&gt;The Neutral Yankees of Nova Scotia: A Marginal Colony during the Revolutionary Years&lt;/i&gt;.

In a circular letter of 12 Jan. 1776 Legge agreed that the militiamen could remain at home until an actual invasion occurred and that the new tax should be deferred.</p>

   <p>Jonathan Eddy (c.17271804), a native of Norton, Mass., participated in Lt. Col. John Winslows expedition to Nova Scotia in 1755 and settled there after the end of the French and Indian War. For Eddys efforts with John Allan to overthrow the royal government in Nova Scotia, see source note. In November 1776 Eddy attempted to capture Fort Cumberland in western
