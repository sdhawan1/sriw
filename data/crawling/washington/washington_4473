   <p>Arnold wrote to David Wooster on 2 Jan.: For Gods sake order as many men down as you can possibly spare, consistent with the safety of Montreal, and all the mortars, howitzers, and shells, that you can possibly bring (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Kenneth Roberts, ed. &lt;i&gt;March to Quebec: Journals of the Members of Arnolds Expedition&lt;/i&gt;. New York, 1938. ]">Roberts, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">March to Quebec</span></span>, 1036). Wooster did not think it safe to send any troops immediately to Quebec. We have, he wrote to Schuyler from Montreal on 5 Jan., but five or six hundred Men for the Garrisons of this Place, Chambly &amp; St Johns, Many of the Troops insist upon going home, their Times of Inlistment being out. . . . I shall not be able to spare any Men to reinforce Colo: Arnold, this Place must be secured for a Retreat, if necessary, I called a Council of my Officers in this Place, who were to a Man agreed that I ought to remain here, I have therefore sent Colo: [James] Clinton with Mr [James] Price who I think may be of great service to him (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>). A reinforcement of 100 men from Montreal did arrive at Quebec on 23 Jan., and Arnold expected 60 more men soon afterwards (Arnold to the Continental Congress, 24 Jan. 1776, <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Kenneth Roberts, ed. &lt;i&gt;March to Quebec: Journals of the Members of Arnolds Expedition&lt;/i&gt;.

   <p>James Clinton (c.17361812), the older brother of George Clinton, commanded the 3d New York Regiment in the Canadian campaign. On 8 Mar. 1776 Clinton became colonel of the 2d New York Regiment, and on 9 Aug. 1776 he was made a Continental brigadier general. Wounded when Fort Montgomery fell to the British in October 1777, Clinton escaped capture and served to the end of the war, participating in Sullivans expedition in 1779 and the Yorktown campaign in 1781.</p>

   <p>James Price, a wealthy English merchant in Montreal, loaned large sums of money to support the American army in Canada. Price, Richard Montgomery wrote Schuyler on 26 Dec. 1775, has been a faithful friend to the Cause indeed. . . . His advice and assistance upon every occasion I have been much benefitted byand when I consider that he has been the first mover of those measures which have been attended with so many and great advantages to the United Colonies, I cant help wishing the Congress to give him an ample testimony of their Sense of his generous and Spirited exertions in the cause of

On 29 Mar. 1776 Congress appointed Price deputy commissary general of stores and provisions for the American forces in Canada.</p>

   <p>Arnold informed Congress on 11 Jan. that he had intelligence that Quebec was short of flour and meat. It appears, he continued, a blockade must answer our purpose; it is possible it may not. Will it be prudent to trust an object of such vast importance to the event? With submission, I think it will not. What is to be done? A sufficient force employed to reduce it, by a regular siege, or assault? If the first is attempted, an addition of three thousand men to our present force will, I make no doubt, be thought necessary; if the latter, at least five thousand. The former, with a vast expense and great waste of ammunition, may prove unsuccessful; the latter, from the extensiveness of their works, I think cannot; and five thousand men will hardly be a sufficient garrison, if the place is taken. I beg leave to recommend the sending a body of at least five thousand men, with an experienced General, into Canada, as early as possible (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Kenneth Roberts, ed. &lt;i&gt;March to Quebec: Journals of the Members of Arnolds Expedition&lt;/i&gt;.

   <p>The list, which is in Arnolds writing, gives the names of six officers who were killed and seven officers who were wounded, including Arnold who was Wounded in the leg. It further reports: Non Commission Officers &amp; Privates killed &amp; Wounded About Sixty Names Unknown. The whole Detachment Prisoners except Capt.

   <p>Two American columns, one led by General Montgomery and one by Arnold, attacked Quebecs lower town from opposite directions on the night of 31 December. Montgomery intended that the columns meet in the lower town and then push into the upper town, but neither force reached its objective. Montgomerys column, which attacked from the south along the St. Lawrence River, was stopped by sailors and militiamen defending a log house. Montgomery was killed with several of his officers and men in an attempt to storm the building, and his detachment subsequently retreated. Arnolds column, which attacked from the north through the suburbs of St. Roch and Palais, carried the first barricade that it encountered but was repulsed at the next one. An enemy force attacking from the rear cut off the detachments retreat and obliged it to surrender. Arnold was evacuated to the hospital after his leg was shattered by a ball at the first barricade. For other accounts of the action received by GW, see Arnold to Wooster, 31 Dec. 1775, and Donald Campbell to Wooster, 31 Dec. 1775, both in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>.</p>
