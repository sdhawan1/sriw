   <p>GWs letter has not been found. The most recent letter that we have from William Fairfax (16911757) to GW was written in September, but Fairfax may have asked for the Sketch during GWs visit to Alexandria in late November when the two men were undoubtedly together. William Fairfax, of Belvoir near Mount Vernon, was senior member of the colonial council and GWs friend and patron.</p>

   <p>Miss Tville was almost certainly one of the Tubervilles of Westmoreland County. Bryan Fairfax (17361802), who became a lieutenant in George Mercers company of the Virginia Regiment in August 1756, had resigned his commission in December. He disappeared in the spring of 1757,
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-04-02-pb-0101">[101]</span>
and when he was discovered in Annapolis his father wrote GW on 6 May that he supposed that his son, who had been twice refusd in his Love Addresses, had run away to join one of Loudouns regiments in New York. In 1759 Bryan Fairfax married Elizabeth Cary, the younger sister of Sarah Cary Fairfax, the wife of Bryan Fairfaxs half brother George William Fairfax (17241787).</p>

   <p>John Clarke was the brother of Deborah Clarke Fairfax (d. 1747), Bryan Fairfaxs mother and the second wife of William Fairfax. She was from Salem, Massachusetts.</p>

   <p>Loudoun arrived in Boston on 20 Jan. 1757 to meet with officials of the New England colonies in preparation for his planned expedition to Quebec. It was not until 1 May that Loudoun received specific orders from William Pitt to attack the French fortress at Louisburg instead of Quebec. In order to launch the attack on Louisburg, Loudoun in late May sailed from New York to Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was joined there on 10 July by more than 5,000 regular soldiers from Britain and a fleet of British warships, but in August Loudoun decided to abandon the campaign and return to New York. In December 1757 Pitt recalled Loudoun to England.</p>

   <p>Premature reports that the ministry of the duke of Newcastle and Henry Fox had been replaced by that of Pitt and the duke of Devonshire appeared in the colonial press in the late fall of 1756. Pitt did not take office as secretary of state for the Southern Department until early December 1756, and the Pitt-Devonshire ministry did not meet Parliament until it convened on 17 Feb. 1757. The king dismissed Pitt in April, and when Pitt returned to office at the end of June it was to form the famous coalition ministry with the duke of Newcastle that managed the war to its successful conclusion. George, Lord Anson, was the first lord of the admiralty in the Pitt-Newcastle ministry.</p>

GWs secretary John Kirkpatrick left Winchester for Williamsburg in late December when GW departed for Fort Cumberland, and he arrived at Fort Cumberland from Williamsburg and Alexandria in late January 1757. GW recorded in his military accounts that he received on 27 Jan. 2,000 from Kirkpatrick (Va. Regimental Accounts, 175558, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>), which Kirkpatrick had secured from Treasurer John Robinson.</p>

   <p>A duty of 2s. on every hogshead of tobacco exported from Virginia had been collected for the use of the royal government of the colony ever since the colonial assembly first imposed the tax in 1658. GW notes in his Regimental Accounts that Alexander Boyd, paymaster for the Virginia Regiment, paid out 61 7s. for the Workmen at Fort Cumbd to 1 Jan. 1757. The decision reached at Philadelphia in March by Loudoun and the southern governors to have Maryland troops stationed at Fort Cumberland finally solved for GW the problem of maintaining the fort.</p>

Lee served in the House as a burgess from Westmoreland until elevated to the council in March 1757. In a petition to the House of Burgesses received on 18 April 1757, a number of men from Richmond County complained that John Bayne, acting for Colonel Lee, had taken off a number of their servants to serve as soldiers in the Royal American Regiment and had refused to pay them for the servants. A committee of the House found on 4 June that Lee, Bayne, and Denis McCarty had collected for the regiment a large Number of People who were sent in Campbells charge to Williamsburg (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ H.
