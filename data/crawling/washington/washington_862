<p>Giving the necessary Orders and Directions about the chain of Forts to be built on the Frontiers, has kept me so closely employed, that I could not write fully to your Honor until <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">this</span>. But I have got that trouble now pretty well off my hands, as I have dispatched orders, plans and tools to all the officers appointed to that Duty. By the enclosed Council held at Fort Cumberland, your Honor will see our determination there, and where it is necessary to erect the Forts.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0001-ptr">1</a></p>
<p>Although we have not kept strictly to the Act of Assembly, I hope it will be overlooked; as I am sensible this will be the best chain that can possibly be erected for the defence of the people, and that the Assembly aimed at <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">that</span>but, being unacquainted with the situation of the Country had fallen into an error, agreeable to this Council the chain is ordered to be built.</p>
<p>Your Honour by the enclosed Rolls of the companies may see their present establishment;<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> and I send you a copy of their former one, agreeable to your orders; together with the number
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-03-02-pb-0313">[313]</span>
of Drafts from each County, delivered at Fredericksburgh<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> But many of them deserted on their march to this place, and after their arrival here: So we are short of that <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">number</span> now: what remain, are divided among the Companies, to make them equal.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0004-ptr">4</a></p>
<p>Captains Hogg and Waggeners Rolls I can not yet send, as they are not come to hand.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0005" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0005-ptr">5</a></p>
<p>The two vacant companies, Captain Savage and the late John Mercers, as I had your Honours approbation for the Field Officers having companies, are disposed of to Colonel Stephens and myselfThe next vacancy the Major must fill.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0006" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0006-ptr">6</a></p>
<p>I am very glad your Honour intends to order the Draughts now to be made, to be sent herePrince-William, Fairfax and Culpeper, are more convenient to this place than FredericksburghThen their being ordered here saves a ninety miles march.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0007" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0007-ptr">7</a></p>
<p>I make no doubt your Honour has ere this heard of the Defeat of Lieutenant Rutherford, of the Rangers, escorting an Express to me at Fort Cumberland; and of the dastardly behaviour of the militia, who ran off without one half of them having discharged their pieces, altho they were apprized of the ambuscade by one of the flanking party, before the Indians fired upon them; and ran back to Ashbys Fort, contrary to orders, persuasions, threats, &amp;c.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0008" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0008-ptr">8</a> They are all ordered in so soon as the people have secured their HarvestThose of King-George and Caroline are already here, the rest I expect shortly.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0009" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0009-ptr">9</a> Through the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">passive</span> Behaviour of their Officers, they have been very refractory. Captain Stewarts Troop has for these twelve months past, and must still continue to do Duty on Foot. Their pay is very greatI should be glad of your Honours orders in regard to them, whether they are to be continued?<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0010" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0010-ptr">10</a> I think with the number of men we have, there is but a poor prospect of finishing our Forts in time; and a much worse of defending our Frontiers properlyand I would be glad some expedient could be fallen upon to augment it.</p>
<p>There is an Act of Parliament to allow all Servants to enlist, and the owners to be paid a reasonable allowance for them: if we had this priviledge, we could soon complete the Regiment; and I doubt not but his Majesty would order them to be paid for, if we enlisted, as soon as for the Regulars: nay, shoud he not, the ten pounds fine thro the Country would go a considerable
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-03-02-pb-0314">[314]</span>
way towards it.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0011" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0011-ptr">11</a> And this we may depend upon, if we have not this liberty granted us, the Servants will all run off to the Regular Officers, who are recruiting about us<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0012" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0012-ptr">12</a>and that would be to weaken our Colony much, when it could receive no immediate benefit from it, but only be benefited in a general way. For my part I see no other expedient. Now your Honour sees plainly the effect the act of Assembly, in regard to the Draughts, has had; and how little our strength has been augmented by that schemeand in three or four months we shall not be the better for themthen they are to be discharged!<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0013" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0013-ptr">13</a></p>
<p>I am confident, if we had had authority to enlist Servants, the Regiment would have been complet ere this; and with little troublefor many have offered, and many have been discharged after enlisting. Mr Kirkpatrick will deliver your Honour a list of the preferments in my Regiment, with the dates of the Officers commissionsThere are five or six more still waiting.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0014" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0014-ptr">14</a> Lieutenant Stark has followed Fraziers example, upon the like occasion; being appointed to Captain Hoggs Company.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0015" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0015-ptr">15</a></p>
<p>I have sent Lieutenant Bullet to relieve Lieutenant McNeill;<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0016" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0016-ptr">16</a> whose seniority entiles him to Captain Lieutenancy: and he has my promise when a vacancy happens to have his commission antedated, and to take his proper rank in the Regiment; as I take him to be a very diligent good officer, and as he was overlooked in the promotions, this indulgence has been promised him.</p>
<p>I could wish we were clear of Fort CumberlandIt takes a great part of our small force to garrison it: and I see no service it is to our Colony; for since the Indians have drove the Inhabitants so low down, they do not hesitate to follow them as far as Conogochieg and this place<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0017" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0017-ptr">17</a>There have been several families murdered within two miles of the mouth of Conogochieg, on the Maryland side, this week<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0018" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0018-ptr">18</a>and Fort Cumberland is now so much out of the way, that they seldom hear of those things, within a month after they are done. Our men want many necessaries, until the arrival of their Regimentals, which can not be had without sending to Philadelphia: and the great loss we shall suffer by sending them our paper-money, has prevented my purchasing these things until the men are almost naked. I should be glad your Honour would send me a Letter of Credit to Mr Allen,<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0019" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0019-ptr">19</a> or some person there; or Gold, or Bills;
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-03-02-pb-0315">[315]</span>
for we can not afford to put up with the loss of sending paper moneywhich I am credibly informed, may be bought up in Philadelphia for fifteen per cent <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">their</span> currency; so that the least we woud lose by that traffic, would be ten per cent.</p>
<p>We are in great want of Drums here, and none can be bought; we now have many young Drummers learning hereso I must beg you will please to order some immediately from Williamsburgh to us, for we can not do without them.</p>
<p>The Rangers are still paid out of the money in my handsI never received but one hundred pounds from Lord Fairfax, or Colonel George.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0020" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0020-ptr">20</a></p>
<p>Captain Gist has some accompts against the Country for necessary ServicesI doubt not your Honor will consider the justice of them; and assist the poor man in the affair; as he is put to great inconveniences for want of the moneyhas been obliged to advance his own, as far as it would goand people to whom he owes Balances upon that account, are daily threatning him with Suits.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0021" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0021-ptr">21</a></p>
<p>Captain McNeil writes me, that out of the three companies of Rangers on the Frontiers of Augusta, which ought to be one hundred and twenty men, there are not thirty: I hope your Honour will have that affair enquired into.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0022" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0022-ptr">22</a></p>
<p>I am to be summoned against one Napp for making counterfeit paper-money here, I desire your Directions, whether I must appear or notit may, perhaps, be at a time when I am much wanted <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">here</span>.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0023" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0023-ptr">23</a></p>
<p>I could by no means bring the Quakers to any TermsThey chose rather to be whipped to death than bear arms, or lend us any assistance whatever upon the Fort, or any thing of self-defence. Some of their friends have been security for their appearance when they are called for; and I have released them from the Guard-House until I receive further orders from your Honourwhich they have agreed to apply for.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0024" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0024-ptr">24</a></p>
<p>I am informed there has been application made to your Honor, for the discharge of some of the Militia who enlisted hereas the case may have been represented to your Honor in a wrong light by prejudiced persons, I shall give you a true state of it, from my own knowledge.</p>
<p>After the Militia were fixed on to march to their different posts, it was common for twenty or more to desert of a night: In
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-03-02-pb-0316">[316]</span>
consequence of which I despatched the Militia Officers with what remained, and some of my own Officers in pursuit of these Deserters, who apprehended seventeen or eighteen of them, and brought them to town.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0025" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0289-fn-0025-ptr">25</a> The Militia had then marchedTo send these men after them I was certain would not answerto avoid that, was the cause of their desertion; and I could not spare men to send an Escort with them to their different partiesand, if I had let them pass unpunished, it would have occasioned all the Militia at work on the Fort to desert. So I thought it most advisable to punish them, to deter the rest, and prevent a second Fault in them; and accordingly ordered them twenty lashes each; and then intended to have set them to work on the Fort.</p>
<p>When they had marched from the Guard-house (where several had enlisted before any punishment was ordered them) some of the officers applied for money, and said all the militia would enlist; which I gave them, and at the same time a charge, to use no unfair means or threats, which they engaged.</p>
<p>In order to prevent any, I sent out Captain Mercer to acquaint <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">them</span> with my charge to the Officers, and to tell them, that if any unfair means had been made use of to engage them to take the money, to declare it, and they should be allowed to return it; and further be acquainted with the indulgence allowed them by act of Parliament; and that they had a right to return the money within twenty-four hours, if they should repent of what they had done in that time: They <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">all</span> declared their willingness to enlistsaid no unfair means had been made use of, and that it was better to enlist at <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">once</span>, than to be subject to be draughted every <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">week</span>: when they were Soldiers, they knew what to depend uponwhich they could not beforeas their being draughted at an unseasonable time might ruin them. They used the same arguments again to Captain Mercer, when he read the Articles of War to them; and he again repeated what he had told them before in the morning; as I have been assured by several of the officers then present.</p>
<p>The men have always appeared well satisfied, and never have made the least complaint; nor will not, I am sensible, if, they are not persuaded to it by the people below. They have now been enlisted upwards of ten weeks, and are very good men, upon the whole.</p>
<span class="pb center" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-03-02-pb-0317">[317]</span>
<p>I dare say your Honour will judge the men to be fairly enlisted, and that they are no ways entitled to a Discharge; which will be applied for by some Gentlemen below; But I shall take your Honours directions on that point.</p>

   <p>On 19 Aug. 1756 Dinwiddie wrote GW agreeing to paying masters, if You can enlist Servants agreeable to the Act of Parliamt; and on 13 Sept. he wrote that although he knew of no Act of Parliamt on that head, he had Directions from both the secretary of state and Lord Loudoun approving the enlisting of servants. The 10 fine GW mentions was the fee that any man drafted from the militia could pay in order to be excused from serving.

   <p>Men for the new Royal American Regiment were being recruited during this summer. In January 1756 the cabinet council in London agreed to a search in Switzerland and Germany for Protestant officers who might be given commissions in the British army for the specific purpose of raising and ordering a regiment in America. The Royal American Regiment (the 62d, later the 60th) was to be made up, it was supposed, largely of men recruited from among the German settlers in Pennsylvania. Parliament and the king approved the scheme in February and March, and the German and Swiss officers who had been given commissions sailed for America in mid-April, arriving by packet in New York in early June.</p>

   <p>GW was referring not only to how few men had come into the regiment through the draft (fewer than 250 on 25 June instead of the 1,200 hoped for) but also to the fact that the assembly had fixed 1 Dec. 1756 as the date for the discharge of all draftees.</p>

   <p>The list conveyed by John Kirkpatrick has not been found, but the names of the men to whom GW recently had given commissions or new appointments are in his Orders, 12 July 1756.

Cumberland, GW had often presented arguments to Dinwiddie and Speaker John Robinson for giving up Fort Cumberland. Here in August 1756 he began a new campaign for the Virginia forces to abandon the fort in Maryland, which contributed to a strain in the relations between GW and the lieutenant governor which is so apparent in their correspondence in the fall of 1756.</p>

   <p>When Braddocks army moved into Pennsylvania in June 1755, the Virginia frontier was laid open to Indian raids. On 27 June the House of Burgesses ordered that a bill be brought in for raising the Sum of Twenty Thousand Pounds for the Protection of his Majestys Subjects against the Insults and Encroachments of the <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">French</span> (<span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ H.

Early in July 1755, even before signing the bill, Dinwiddie gave orders for one company of rangers to be raised in Augusta County and two companies in the upper frontier counties of Frederick and Hampshire, to be pd by the Country (Dinwiddie to Lord Fairfax, 4 July 1755, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Virginia Historical Society, Richmond ]">ViHi</span>: Dinwiddie Papers). On 14 Aug. 1755 Dinwiddie wrote Lord Fairfax that he had sent by Colo. [George William] Fairfax []400 for the use of the Rangers, with companies being raised in Frederick and Hampshire counties (ibid.). When GW assumed command of the Virginia Regiment on 1 Sept. 1755, he also became commander of all other Virginia forces, which included the companies of rangers commanded by William Cocks and John Ashby. Presumably the money in my hands which he refers to here was money provided by Dinwiddie out of the appropriation for the rangers in July 1755. In response to this letter, <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-03-02-0319" class="document">Dinwiddie wrote GW on 19 Aug. 1756</a> that he was writing to Colo.

On 20 Oct. 1756, however, GW recorded a payment of 68 13s. 9d. from George William Fairfax of Rangers Money. See Va.
