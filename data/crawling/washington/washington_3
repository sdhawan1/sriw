<p>Between the ages of 17 and 20 GW was a practicing professional land surveyor. During that time he made more than 190 surveys, nearly all of them for grants of new lands on the frontiers of Lord Fairfaxs Northern Neck Proprietary. Frontier surveying was a lucrative business in Virginia at the middle of the eighteenth century, as swarms of settlers and speculators laid claim to the colonys western lands, both inside and outside the Northern Neck. A diligent frontier surveyor working only a few months out of the year could clear annually 100 or more in Virginia current money, a cash income greater than that of most planters and tradesmen in the colony. Frontier surveyors, in addition, had ample opportunities to patent choice tracts of land in their own names, and many acquired holdings of several thousand acres. Surveying was a respectable occupation for a young Virginian in 1749, roughly on a par with law, medicine, the church, or military service, and most of the surveyors were drawn from the Virginia gentry.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0001-ptr">1</a></p>
<p>GWs career as a surveyor owed much to the Fairfax family. Close acquaintance with the proprietor, Thomas, Lord Fairfax, and with Fairfaxs relatives at Belvoir assured GW of receiving profitable surveying assignments in the Northern Neck, and it was probably at the behest of Lord Fairfax and through the agency of William Fairfax,
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0009">[9]</span>
who sat on the governors council, that GW obtained the surveyorship of Culpeper County at the start of his professional career. Young men of 17 usually did not serve as county surveyors. Most novice surveyors began as apprentices or deputies to county surveyors and did not become county surveyors themselves, if ever, until they had had some years of experience. Before 20 July 1749, nevertheless, GW received a commission from the president and masters of the College of William and Mary appointing him surveyor of newly formed Culpeper County.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0002-ptr">2</a> The college in its charter of 1693 had been granted the power to appoint all Virginia county surveyors and the right to collect one-sixth of their surveying fees, but in practice the college authorities were more concerned with their income than with who was appointed to the surveyorships. They regularly deferred to the wishes of powerful men in commissioning surveyors, and in the case of Culpeper, which lay in the Northern Neck, they were undoubtedly open to any suggestion that Lord Fairfax might make for the countys surveyor.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0003-ptr">3</a> GW did not study at the college to qualify for the commission or stand any examination by the president and masters of the school.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0004-ptr">4</a> There is no evidence, in fact, that GW went to Williamsburg in the spring or summer of 1749. Most probably, William Fairfax, who attended council in Williamsburg from March to May 1749, secured the commission for him. On 20 July 1749 GW appeared before the justices of the Culpeper court and, after presenting his commission, took the oaths of public office for the first time and became the countys first surveyor.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0005" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0005-ptr">5</a></p>
<p>Two days later GW ran a survey of 400 acres on Flat Run in east central Culpeper County for Richard Barnes of Richmond County. GW decorated his plat of the survey with a handsome compass rose and a sketch of Mount Pony, an area landmark, and signed his name in full with his new title Survy of Culpeper Cty. It is the only survey that he is known to have made in the county in which he was commissioned.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0006" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0006-ptr">6</a> Thereafter, his surveying was done almost entirely in the Shenandoah and Cacapon valleys of Frederick County, which until 1753 embraced all of the Northern Neck Proprietary west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Surveyors in the Northern Neck, unlike surveyors in the rest of Virginia, were allowed, at Lord Fairfaxs pleasure, to make public surveys outside the counties to which they were appointed. Under those circumstances it is not surprising that GW chose to survey on the frontier. Culpeper, although a new county, was fairly well settled. Most of its desirable lands had been surveyed and granted while it was part of Orange County, whereas on the other side of the Blue Ridge, in Frederick County, people were claiming many vacant

tracts in 1749, providing a great deal of lucrative business for a surveyor.</p>
<p>During the fall of 1749 GW ran at least 15 surveys on the Lost River, as the upper portion of the Cacapon River is called, and during the following spring he ran at least 49 surveys on the Cacapon, Lost, North, and Little Cacapon rivers and on the Potomac River near the mouths of the Cacapon and Little Cacapon. All of these surveys, although in Frederick County, he signed with his title S.C.C.surveyor of Culpeper County. Because in Virginia one could not legally make public surveys without a commission as a county surveyor, an assistant county surveyor, or special surveyor, the inclusion of GWs title on these surveys was an indication that they were legitimate. GW, however, did not long remain surveyor of Culpeper. On the survey that he made on the Shenandoah River on 16 Aug. 1750, GW omitted S.C.C. from his signature, and except for the survey of 28 Aug. 1750 for George Johnston, the initials do not seem to have again appeared on GWs work. On 3 Nov. 1750 Henry Lee became surveyor of Culpeper County.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0007" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0007-ptr">7</a> GW may have quit the office because it was more trouble than it was worth, or he may have been replaced for neglecting the county. In either case, he continued surveying in Frederick County, and for his surveys there to continue to be legal he should have had another surveying appointment of some kind. The absence of any title at all on GWs surveys after he stopped using S.C.C. suggests that he may have become one of the several assistants to Frederick County surveyor James Wood, since Frederick County assistants signed their surveys without title.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0008" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0008-ptr">8</a> No record, however, has been found of GWs being commissioned as an assistant surveyor in Frederick County. It is certain only that Lord Fairfax continued to allow GW to survey for grants after he ceased to be surveyor of Culpeper County and that no one challenged the legitimacy of his work.</p>
<p>GW usually received his surveying assignments in packets of land warrants issued from the Proprietary land office at Belvoir. Addressed to GW and signed by William Fairfax, as the proprietors agent, or by Williams son George William Fairfax on behalf of his father, these documents instructed GW to survey an approximate acreage for a specific person at a general location by a certain date, normally 5 to 6 months from the date of the warrant. The person for whom the land was to be surveyed in most cases paid a fee of 18s. 9d. for the warrant<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0009" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0009-ptr">9</a> and indicated the size and location of the tract that he or she wished the proprietor to grant to them. Lord Fairfax or his agent approved the claim and chose the surveyor who was to lay off the bounds. The most desirable set of warrants for a surveyor was one that gave him a number of relatively small and simple four-or-five-sided
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0011">[11]</span>

<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0012">[12]</span>
tracts to measure, within a compact area so that he could move rapidly from one to another, collecting the maximum number of fees for the time he spent in the field. GWs assignments, for the most part, were reasonably good in this respect. His surveys were often simple and near each other and sometimes had the additional advantage of being contiguous, making it possible to use one or more boundaries for two tracts. On at least 3 occasions GW was able to do four surveys in a day and on at least 13 other occasions three surveys in a day. At other times, of course, he worked more slowly, because the surveys were large or complex or there was some distance to travel between them.</p>
<p>GW, like most frontier surveyors, usually surveyed in the spring and fall, when the weather was most pleasant, snakes and insects were least troublesome, and the thin foliage of trees made it easier to sight long boundary lines through wooded areas. He departed significantly from this pattern only in Aug. 1750 when he made a brief surveying trip to the Shenandoah Valley and in the fall of 1751 when he did not survey because of his trip to Barbados with his ailing half brother Lawrence Washington.</p>
<p>In the field GW undoubtedly used the instruments commonly used by other American surveyors of the time. Boundary line bearings were determined with a circumferentor, or plain surveying compass as it was sometimes called, which consisted essentially of a magnetic compass in a brass case with open brass sights attached, the whole mounted on a staff or tripod. Distances were measured with a surveying chain, a series of interconnected wrought iron links, each about 8 inches long, usually totaling 2 poles or 33 feet in length.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0010" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0010-ptr">10</a> As the surveyor traversed the tract with the circumferentor, determining the lay of its boundaries and reading their bearings from the compass dial, two chainmen ascertained the distances with the chain, and a marker notched trees to indicate where the lines ran. Most Virginia surveyors used local people as chainmen and markers and often had different crews on consecutive surveys. GW too followed this practice, except that on about half of his surveys he used John Lonem as his head chainman, apparently valuing Lonems reliability and speed enough to take him from survey to survey.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0011" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0011-ptr">11</a></p>
<p>There was no standard format in eighteenth-century Virginia for surveyors field notes, but surveyors were expected to keep adequate field books, and GWs are fairly typical. Thin pocket-size volumes, they contain in rough form the essential information needed to produce the finished surveys that were later submitted to the proprietors office. Included in the field books are the date of each survey, the name of the person for whom it was run, the bearings of the boundary
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0013">[13]</span>

<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0014">[14]</span>
lines without correction for magnetic declination,<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0012" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0012-ptr">12</a> their lengths in poles, the trees or other natural features that marked the corners of the tract, the names of any owners of adjoining lands, and the names of the chainmen and usually of the marker. Often, however, the bearing and length of the final course, the one that closed the survey, are omitted. Instead of running that line on the ground with compass and chain, GW, like other surveyors, frequently calculated it from the plat, or small map, that he later made of the survey.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0013" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0013-ptr">13</a></p>
<p>The platting of the surveys and the computation of their acreages occurred after the end of the surveying trip, probably at Ferry Farm or Mount Vernon. The acreage of a survey, once determined, was usually inserted into the field book to be part of the original record, but plats, with a few early exceptions, do not appear in the field books, being drawn only for the finished surveys.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0014" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0014-ptr">14</a> All of GWs plats were carefully drawn to scale in ink with standard drafting instruments that are known to have included a 2foot Gunters scale.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0015" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0015-ptr">15</a> The 1749 plats have compass roses or north arrows and accurate linear scales, but those features were omitted after 1749. Only a few of GWs plats show mountains, hills, houses, or roads. Most include the water features and the names of adjoining landowners as required by Virginia law. In some cases, however, even these items are missing. His plat of the 21 Mar. 1752 survey for John Dunbar is unusually spare, showing only the lines that represent the tracts five sides and letters to designate the five corners.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0016" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0016-ptr">16</a> In general, despite many minor variations from plat to plat, GWs drawing style tended to become simpler with time. The elaborate style that he used for his first plat in July 1749 did not survive long under the pressures of routine surveying. Usually beside or below the plat, GW copied the written description of the survey from the field book, again without corrections for magnetic variation. He dated the survey with the date that the lines were run in the field and signed it at the bottom next to the names of the chainmen and marker, normally with a stylized signature used only on his surveys.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0017" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0017-ptr">17</a> To indicate that a survey had been platted, GW wrote Plat drawn, or occasionally P.D., on the appropriate page of his field books, and beginning in March 1751 he often added Copyd to denote that the description had been transcribed.</p>
<p>The finished survey, comprising both the plat and description, was returned with the warrant to the proprietors office, where it sometimes lay for several years before a grant was issued. About a third of the tracts that GW surveyed were granted within 2 years time and over half within 5 years. Many, however, were not granted until the late 1750s or the 1760s and 1770s. One, a tract that GW surveyed for James Denton on 21 Mar. 1752, was not granted until 1 Aug. 1780,
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0015">[15]</span>
 
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0016">[16]</span>
and another, a tract he surveyed on 2 April 1752 for Thomas Mullin, not until 6 Dec. 1791.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0018" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0018-ptr">18</a> A few may never have been granted at all.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0019" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0019-ptr">19</a> The delay in issuing grants was caused in some cases by challenges from rival claimants, but in many instances the person for whom a survey had been made simply chose not to have the land granted right away. One did not have to pay Lord Fairfax his annual quitrent of 1s. per 50 acres for ungranted lands, while title to a survey established a firm claim to the tract in question and could be devised to heirs or sold to other persons by a simple written assignment.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0020" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0020-ptr">20</a> To clear up the backlog of ungranted surveys and obtain quitrents that otherwise would not be paid, the proprietors agent declared on 26 Mar. 1765 that all surveys dated before 1764 would be forfeited if the fees required for issuance of the grant were not paid by 29 Sept. 1765.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0021" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0021-ptr">21</a> Some of GWs surveys were so forfeited by their owners and were granted to others, but many tracts apparently continued to be granted on the basis of assignments from the original owners. The grants, when issued, were signed by Lord Fairfax. Included in them are the terms under which the land was to be held (essentially the payment of the quitrent forever by the grantee and his heirs or assignees), the name of the surveyor, and the written description of the tracts boundaries taken from the finished survey.

<p>No accounts have been found for most of GWs surveying customers. The few accounts that do exist show that he usually charged 2 3s. Virginia current money for a survey of 1,000 acres or less, a sum that was due any time after the survey was run in the field but in some cases, at least, was not paid until months or even years later.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0022" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0022-ptr">22</a> GWs surveying fee exceeded the fee of 1 11s. 3d. that the Virginia Assembly had established for frontier counties such as Frederick, corresponding instead to the higher fee that surveyors were allowed to collect in counties along the colonys fall line. How GW justified the higher fee is not known, but it seems to have been paid without objection. If GW collected 2 3s. for each of his professional surveys of 1,000 or less acres and a bit more for the four of over 1,000 acres which he ran, he must have earned nearly 400 in his slightly more than 3 years of surveying.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0023" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0023-ptr">23</a> In addition, between 1749 and 1752 GW acquired 2,315 acres of good land in the lower Shenandoah Valley, some of it by purchase and some by grants.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0024" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0024-ptr">24</a> That holding matched Lawrence Washingtons Mount Vernon in acreage, if not in other respects.</p>

the fall of 1752, but there are two evident ones. As lucrative as surveying on the Northern Neck frontier was between 1749 and 1752, it offered only diminishing prospects for the future. The supply of desirable new lands was already beginning to run low in the Northern Neck by 1752, and the dominance of Lord Fairfax in the whole land-granting process prevented Northern Neck surveyors, whether they held county appointments or not, from establishing power bases of their own in the way many frontier surveyors in other parts of Virginia did. As a Northern Neck surveyor, GW would be no more than a gentleman of the second rank. In addition, GW had a strong appetite for soldiering, whetted no doubt by the example of his half brother Lawrence. By the spring of 1752 GW had learned that the office of adjutant for the colony, an office that Lawrence held, was to be divided into districts. On 10 June 1752 he asked Lt. Gov. Robert Dinwiddie to consider him for the Northern Neck adjutancy. Instead, the council on 6 Nov. 1752 appointed him adjutant for southern Virginia with a salary of 100 a year.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0025" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0025-ptr">25</a> GW did not survey professionally thereafter, but throughout the remainder of his life he frequently employed his surveying skills for his own private purposes: to acquire new land by purchase or grant both east and west of the mountains, to find and defend the boundaries of his many holdings, and to divide them into profitable fields and tenements. As late as Nov. 1799 he spent 3 days on Difficult Run in northern Fairfax County running the lines of his land there and of a nearby tract that he hoped to buy. Only his death 5 weeks later put an end to his surveying.</p>
<p>The records of GWs professional surveying career are both varied and scattered. The most valuable of these, the finished surveys with their plats and full descriptions of the boundaries, are among the most widely dispersed. Long more valued by private manuscript collectors than by historians for GWs signature and for their visual appeal, the finished surveys in many cases remain in private hands. Manuscript dealers catalogues frequently include them in their offerings and sometimes reproduce them in full or partial facsimile. Several public repositories have one or more finished GW surveys, but only the Henry Huntington Library and Princeton University seem to have more than 10. The most comprehensive and complete of GWs surveying records are his two field books, covering the years 1749 to 1751, in the Washington Papers at the Library of Congress and the Northern Neck grant books at the Virginia State Library which cite all his surveys that became grants, about 95 percent of the total known. No field book has been found for 1752, and the earlier of the two field books in the Library of Congress has five sheets torn out for the year 1749. However, two of those sheets, including the title page, are at

This notebook includes those surveys missing from the early field book, although one of the notebooks sheets is also torn out. That sheet, which includes two surveys, is at the Pennsylvania Historical Society.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0027" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0027-ptr">27</a> Warrants for GWs surveys are the scarcest and the least informative of all his surveying records. Small collections of his warrants are in the Washington Papers at the Library of Congress, at the Virginia State Library, at the Henry Huntington Library, and in Lord Fairfax of Camerons collections at Gays House, Berkshire, Eng. GWs 1748 diary in the Washington Papers at the Library of Congress includes A List of the Peoples Names that I have Warrants for, which apparently is for the period 174950.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0028" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0028-ptr">28</a></p>

A thorough search of the Northern Neck grant books revealed 13 GW surveys not found in the other sources. They appear under no date at the end of the list. Of the surveys GW made for grants, only 6 were not found in the grant book. The acreage for a particular tract is not always the same in the finished survey, the grant, and the field-book entry. The acreage on the finished survey is the most accurate one in all cases and has been given in our list whenever possible. The grant, which occasionally has clerical copying errors, has been used as the second choice, and the field-book entry, which sometimes has errors in calculation that were corrected in the finished survey, as the third choice. Locations are usually given in reference to a major river or stream and are generally taken directly from the finished survey, grant, or field-book entry, in that order. However, many of GWs Shenandoah Valley surveys contain no specific references to well-known terrain features. To determine their exact locations in relation to the numerous streams that flow into the lower Shenandoah River, most of them were platted on a modern terrain map.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0030" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0004-fn-0030-ptr">30</a> All surveys, except the undated ones, are listed in chronological order according to the date they were run by GW. Surveys of the same date are arranged in the order they appear in GWs field books for the years 174951 and in alphabetical order for 1752 and in the undated section.</p>

   <p>The early Culpeper deeds, which have also been almost totally lost, may have contained some deeds and divisions for the period 174950 based on GW surveys, although it is unlikely that there were many. There is no evidence to support the local tradition that on 24 July 1749 GW laid off the town of Washington, Va., the site of which was then in Culpeper County, but he did draw a plat of the new town of Alexandria sometime apparently during the summer or fall (<span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC</span>: Geography and Map Division).

   <p>GW sometimes included the cost of the warrant in the fees that he charged the person for whom he surveyed, indicating either that he had advanced the money for the warrant when it was issued to him or, more likely, that he paid the warrant fee on behalf of the warrantee when the survey and warrant were returned to the proprietary land office.

   <p>Lonem did not work with GW in the summer or fall of 1750 but carried the chain for him on about half of his surveys in the fall of 1749 and the springs of 1751 and 1752 and on nearly all of his surveys in the spring of 1750.

   <p>GWs use of this procedure is indicated by the words from thence to the beginning found near the end of many of his field-book entries, especially among the earlier ones. On some occasions GW added the bearings and lengths as he later determined them to the field-book entry, but many times he did not. They always appear in the finished surveys, however.</p>

   <p>The field-book entries for 1749 do not include acreages but do have some plats.

   <p>GW used the signature GWashington, written in a stylized manner, on most of his surveys through the spring of 1751. In the springs of 1751 and 1752, however, he also began using a less stylized G: Washington with some frequency, and his final survey in the fall of 1752 is signed with his familiar Go: Washington signature.
