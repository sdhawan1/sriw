   <p>Although Congress appointed eight brigadier generals on 22 June, GW decided to delay announcing those appointments when he learned shortly after his arrival in Cambridge that some of the New England officers, unhappy at not being given higher rank or precedence, might refuse their commissions.

   <p>Thomas Mifflin (17441800) and Joseph Reed (17411785), handsome and articulate young Philadelphians already prominent in the business and political circles of their city and colony, became well known to GW during the First and Second Continental Congresses when he dined at their homes on several occasions (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig, eds. &lt;i&gt;The Diaries of George Washington&lt;/i&gt;. 6 vols.

Mifflin, a well-educated Quaker merchant who served in both Continental Congresses, was one of the youngest and most radical of the delegates and quickly distinguished himself as a sprightly and spirited Speaker (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ L. H. Butterfield, ed. &lt;i&gt;Diary and Autobiography of John Adams&lt;/i&gt;. 4 vols. Cambridge, Mass., 1961. ]">Butterfield, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Adams Diary and Autobiography</span></span>, 2:150). On 27 May 1775 Mifflin was named with GW and several other delegates to a committee charged with finding ways to supply the colonies with ammunition and military stores (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Worthington Chauncey Ford et al., eds. &lt;i&gt;Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789&lt;/i&gt;. 34 vols. Washington, D.C., 190437. ]"><span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">JCC</span></span>, 2:67). Reed, a more moderate advocate of the American cause than Mifflin, had a growing legal practice in Philadelphia and was an active land speculator. Through the family of his English-born wife, he became acquainted with Lord Dartmouth, secretary of state for the American colonies, and from December 1773 to February 1775, he corresponded regularly with Dartmouth, explaining and defending colonial
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-03-01-02-pb-0057">[57]</span>
opinions and actions. Reed served with Mifflin on the Philadelphia committee of correspondence, and in January 1775 he was elected president of the second Pennsylvania provincial congress. Following the battles of Lexington and Concord, both Reed and Mifflin joined Philadelphias military associators: Reed as a lieutenant colonel and Mifflin as a major. Although neither man had any other military experience, GW chose them for his staff because he needed efficient managers in his headquarters more than he needed expert soldiers. He wished to have about him intelligent confidants to whom he could delegate a wide variety of tasks.</p>


   <p>Mifflin accepted a position as aide-de-camp before GW left Philadelphia. Reed, however, was reluctant to abandon his family and business to become GWs secretary, and he at first agreed only to accompany GW part of the way to Cambridge. It was apparently at New York that Reed finally accepted GWs offer. Reed explained to Elias Boudinot on 13 Aug. that GW expressed himself to me in such Terms that I thought myself bound by every Tye of Duty and Honour to comply with his Request to help him through the Sea of Difficulties (John F. Roche, <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Joseph Reed, A Moderate in the American Revolution</span> [New York, 1957], 6566). Reed acted as GWs secretary until 30 Oct. 1775, when he took a prolonged leave of absence to go home to Philadelphia. He returned to the army the following June as adjutant general with the rank of colonel. In January 1777 Reed resigned from the army, but he served as a volunteer aide to GW during the ensuing campaign. Reed was a member of the Continental Congress in 1778, and from 1778 to 1781 he was president of the <span class="choice correction" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover_choice ] header=[]  body=[ Corrected from 'Pennsylanvia' &lt;span style='font-size: 90%'&gt;[[2014-08-06]]&lt;/span&gt; ]">Pennsylvania</span> executive council. Mifflin became quartermaster general of the Continental army on 14 Aug. 1775. He was promoted to colonel on 22 Dec. 1775, to brigadier general on 16 May 1776, and to major general on 19 Feb. 1777. Accused of negligence and corruption in executing his duties as quartermaster general, Mifflin resigned from the army in February 1779. He served again in the Continental Congress from 1782 to 1784, and while president of that body, he accepted GWs resignation at the end of the war.</p>

   <p>Samuel Griffin (17461810), formerly of Virginia and more recently a resident of Philadelphia, accompanied GW and Charles Lee from that city to Cambridge.
