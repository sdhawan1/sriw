   <p>Lt. William Polson, a Scot, accompanied GW on the expedition into the Ohio country and was present at the capitulation at Fort Necessity on 34 July. After his return from the campaign he was made a captain. The next summer Polson commanded a company of Virginia troops in Braddocks forces, and at the fighting at the Monongahela in July, he and all but one of his officers were killed. He left a wife named Rebecca and an infant child, but the heir to his estate by 1771 was his father, who was then living in Georgia. After the Revolution it was his brother John Polson, a veteran of the Braddock campaign and briefly in the fall of 1755 an officer in GWs regiment, who laid claim to the land bounty due his dead brother for his participation in the expedition of 1754.</p>

   <p>George Mercer (17331784) was one of the lieutenants Dinwiddie appointed in February to recruit men for the proposed expedition to the Forks of the Ohio. He became a captain under GW at the same time that GW became a colonel following Frys death and was present at the capitulation at Fort Necessity in July. When GW organized the new Virginia Regiment in Sept. 1755 after Braddocks defeat, he made Mercer his aide-de-camp. Mercer subsequently served as a company commander in GWs regiment before going in 1757 with a Virginia detachment under Lt. Col. Adam Stephen to South Carolina. In 1758 he was made lieutenant colonel of the 2d Virginia Regiment, which was recruited by Col. William Byrd III for Gen. John Forbess expedition against Fort Duquesne. After the war George Mercer and GW were fellow burgesses from Frederick County from 1761 to 1765, and in 1765 Mercer briefly held the title of Stamp Act officer for the colony. As the London agent for the Ohio Company, 1763 to 1770, Mercer lived in England after 1765 and remained abroad during the American Revolution. He was the son of John Mercer (17041768) of Stafford County and the brother of Capt. John Fenton Mercer (17351756) of the Virginia Regiment.</p>

   <p>Thomas Waggener (d. 1760), who, like George Mercer, was one of the lieutenants appointed by Dinwiddie in Feb. 1754, was wounded slightly in the skirmish of 28 May between GWs force and the French. Cited by the Virginia Assembly for bravery in the unsuccessful defense of Fort Necessity in early July, Waggener was promoted to captain. In 1755 he commanded a Virginia company in Braddocks defeat on the Monongahela, where he was wounded and his brother Edmund Waggener was killed. As colonel of the new Virginia Regiment, GW kept Waggener and his company on the frontier, in the vicinity of the South Branch of the Potomac, from the fall of 1755 until the summer of 1758. Waggeners company was among the Virginia forces in John Forbess army that reached the site of Fort Duquesne after the French had abandoned and burned it. Waggener remained for a time with a detachment of Virginians at what is now Pittsburgh, before returning to Virginia in Sept.

1759. According to GW, he had been an officer in the Virginia contingent of the planned expedition to Canada in 1746.</p>

   <p>Jacob Van Braam (17251784) was born in Holland and came to America in 1752. By 1753 he had settled in Fredericksburg where, with GW, he was a member of the Fredericksburg Masonic Lodge. In that year he accompanied GW as an interpreter on the journey to the French commandant. Van Braam had previous military experience as a lieutenant in the Dutch army. Present at the capitulation of Fort Necessity, he was widely criticized for his translation of the articles of capitulation. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-01-02-0076" class="document">The Capitulation of Fort Necessity, 3 July 1754</a>. He was one of the two hostages demanded by the French after the Fort Necessity defeat and remained a prisoner in Canada until 1760. After his release he secured a commission in the Royal American Regiment and at the end of the war settled in Wales. In 1775 he rejoined the Royal American Regiment and served at Saint Augustine in East Florida and as a captain in the British campaign in Georgia. He sold his commission in 1779 and settled in France (Van Braam to Lord George Germain, 31 July 1777, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Public Record Office, also known as National Archives (UK-KeNA), Kew, Surrey, England ]">P.R.O.</span>, C.O. 5/116, ff. 224; Van Braam to GW, 20 Dec. 1783, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>). Van Braam was ordered in Jan. 1754 to recruit in Augusta County (see <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-01-02-0031" class="document">Dinwiddie to GW, Jan. 1754</a>), but in addition to finding the Augusta County lieutenant, James Patton, less than cooperative, Van Braam discovered that few residents of this frontier county were willing to join the expedition and leave their families unprotected against Indian raids.</p>

   <p>Rose was probably Hugh Rose, who served as an ensign and lieutenant in the Cartagena campaign and apparently retired on half pay as a captain. After failing in his attempt to raise recruits in a Virginia company in the winter of 1755, Rose was appointed a first lieutenant in William Pepperrells regiment (<span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ R.

   <p>Adam Stephen (c.17181791), a Scottish medical doctor who served in the British navy before coming to America, was made a major by GW in June 1754. When Lt. Col. George Muse resigned his commission in July after the defeat at Fort Necessity, Stephen became lieutenant colonel under GW. In the months after GWs resignation in the fall of 1754 and the mounting of Braddocks expedition in late spring 1755, Stephen was the senior Virginia officer, serving first under Col. James Innes and then under Gov. Horatio Sharpe of Maryland. He participated in Braddocks expedition, and he was in charge of the Virginia forces remaining at Fort Cumberland when GW took command of the new Virginia Regiment in Sept. 1755. He continued as GWs second in command of the Virginia Regiment until GW left the service at the end of 1758 and then succeeded GWs successor William Byrd III as colonel of the regiment in Sept. 1761 not long before it was disbanded. He became a brigadier general in the Continental Army in 1776, but his military career was brought to an abrupt and final end in Nov. 1777 when he was discharged from the service for his conduct at the Battle of Germantown.</p>
