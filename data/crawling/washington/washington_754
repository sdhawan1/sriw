<p>The bearer of this will God willing be my son Landon whose inclinations for the Army have been before discovered but then I had no relish for it because I foresaw in the Number of Masters and one ignorant director many things would fall to an officers lot to account for when every truth received no credit that should be admitted for misadventure for these reasons I put him by but now under an Association where the whole body are evidences and the world only their judges thro impertinence<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0185-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0185-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> I have given him leave and would recommend him to a little of yr respect tho I would not have you be particular in any instance least it might raise the jealousy of others, altho. I must at the same time tell you that it will puzzle you to avoid it for without ever once I believe endeavouring at it he is become the favorite of every acquaintance by a mild easy, familiar and inoffensive way, a Youth of great tempers great Virtue and great resolution will Always find a friend and yo. may tell Peachey if he is in the way that he may shew that Landon and he are acquainted without giving offense.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0185-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0185-fn-0002-ptr">2</a></p>

This made many friends to yr Corps ashamed that their imprudent Corespondents should shew them about and at a time when the Regiment was Augmenting and a Memorial was preparing to move his majesty to take it under his protection and recommending the Officers to his gracious favour there is some attonement due for this and were I the judge it should be a fine of five Indian scalps for every letter that wore such a Complexion and when all comes to All as the saying is who believd it Perhaps one man in a hundred.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-03-02-0185-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-03-02-0185-fn-0004-ptr">4</a></p>

 The evidence indicates that Landon Carter (17101778) of Sabine Hall, Richmond County, wrote this undated letter in May before 17 May, possibly before 10 May. The act for drafting the militia (7 <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ William Waller Hening, ed. &lt;i&gt;The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia, from the First Session of the Legislature, in the Year 1619&lt;/i&gt;. 13 vols. 181923. Reprint. Charlottesville, Va., 1969. ]">Hening</span> 920) passed on 1 May 1756, and so the next Monday for holding the draft in Richmond County, to which Carter refers, could not have been earlier than 10 May, but it could not have been later than 17 May either, for on Sunday, 23 May, Moore Fauntleroy, Jr., showed up in Fredericksburg with a party of Richmond County draftees (Fauntleroys report, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>).</p>

   <p>For the word misadventure in this sentence, Carter first wrote misconduct. He struck out conduct and inserted adventure above it. The substitution does little to clarify the meaning of this passage, but clearly Carter is referring to the Association of Gentlemen formed under Peyton Randolph in May to go to GWs aid. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-03-02-0076&amp;expandNote=GEWN-02-03-02-0076-fn-0006#GEWN-02-03-02-0076-fn-0006" class="document">Dinwiddie to GW, 3 May 1756, n.6</a>.</p>

   <p>If Landon Carter (c.17381801), the second son of Landon Carter of Sabine Hall, did go up to Winchester with Randolphs gentlemen, he seems not to have continued there as a volunteer in the Virginia Regiment, for by November 1756 he was living at Bull Hall, one of two plantations owned by Landon Carter on Bull Run, the stream which divides Prince William and Fairfax counties. Evidence that GW must have exercised considerable tact through the years to remain in the good graces of his influential friend and that the younger Landon did indeed have a mild easy, familiar way about him may be found in the entry of 24 Oct. 1757 in the elder Landon Carters diary. This day near Sunset Landon Carter came home. I with great mildness asked him if he did not think that as he was to go up to Bull Hall tomorrow he ought to have staid at home to have taken my directions with regard to my affairs and if he did not think this Sauntering about from house to house only to inflame himself the more by visiting a woman that he knew I would never Consent to his marrying would not ruin him and contrary to his duty. He answered very calmly No. Then Sir be assured that although you will shortly be of age if you do not henceforward leave her you must leave me. He answer, then Sir I will leave you, on which I bid him be gone out of my house. He took up his hat and sayd so he would as soon as he could get his horse and went off immediately without shewing the least Concern, no not even to turn round.

   <p>The regimental officers were responding to charges coming from Williamsburg of their misconduct at Fort Cumberland. GW first got word of such reports from Dinwiddie in a letter of 8 April 1756, and Carter himself referred in <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-03-02-0031" class="document">his latest letter to GW, that of 21 April</a>, to some reflections that . . . some few of the Officers . . . perhaps may have behaved like disorderly young men. At the recent session, the General Assembly did order a draft for Augmenting the regiment and did adopt a Memorial asking that the Virginia Regiment be made a part of the regular establishment of the British army.</p>

   <p>See the source line note above. Moore Fauntleroy, Jr., in fact, delivered to Fredericksburg only eight draftees from Richmond County, and four of these made up the total of those from the county who were discharged in December 1756.</p>

   <p>It would appear that Carter wrote the postscript after the draft was held in the county. Daniel Williams appears as a sergeant in Fauntleroys list of eight men brought up from Richmond County to Fredericksburgh Agreeable to the Governerers Command (23 May 1756, <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>). He served under his brother Lt. John Williams in Capt. William Peacheys company only until his discharge before the end of August 1756. Lieutenant Williams remained in the Virginia Regiment until June 1757. John Hendren, a May draftee, was identified in July 1756 as a 21year-old weaver in Capt. Charles Lewiss company. He was among the four men from Richmond County who were discharged in December 1756.</p>
