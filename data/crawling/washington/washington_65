<p>Yours of the 1st, 2d, &amp; 4th Ulto<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0001" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0001-ptr">1</a> I receivd by the Post and return your Honour my hearty thanks for your kind congratulation on our late successwhich I hope to improve without risquing the imputation of rashness or hazarding what a prudent conduct woud forbid. I rejoice that I am likely to be happy under the Command off an experienced Officer and a Man of Sense<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0002" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0002-ptr">2</a>it is what I have most ardently wishd for<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0003" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0003-ptr">3</a>I shall here beg leave to return my grateful thanks for your favour in promoting me to the Command of the Regimentbelieve me Honble Sir when I assure you, my Breast is warmd with every generous Sentiment that your goodness can inspire: I want nothing but oppertunity to testifie my sincere regard for your Person, to whom I stand indebted for so many unmerited favours.</p>
<p>Your Honour may depend, I shall myself, and will endeavour to make my Officers shew Captn McKay all the respect due to his Rank &amp; merit but should have been particularly obligd if your Honour had declard whether he was under my Command,
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0130">[130]</span>
or Independant of it. however I shall be studious to avoid all disputes tht may tend to publick prejudice, but as far as I am able will inculcate harmony, and unanimity. I hope Captn McKay will have more Sense than to insist upon any unreasonable distinction, th he and His have Comns from his Majesty; let him consider, tho. we are greatly inferiour in respect to profitable advantages, yet we have the same Spirit to serve our Gracious King as they have; and are as ready, and willing to sacrafice our lives for our Countrys good as themand here once more and for the last time I must say this Will be a canker that will grate some Officers of this Regiment beyond all measure to serve upon such different terms when their Lives, their Fortunes, and their Characters are equally, and I dare say as effectually exposd as those who are happy enough to have Kings Commissions.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0004" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0004-ptr">4</a></p>
<p>I have been sollicitous on this head, have earnestly endeavourd to reconcile the Officers to their appointment and flatter myself I have succededhaving heard no mention thereof lately. I considerd the pernicious consequences that would have attended a disunion; therefore, was too much attachd to my Countrys Interest to suffer it to ripen after I recd your advising Letters.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0005" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0005-ptr">5</a> Your assurance Honble Sir of His Majestys favour has given me the greatest satisfaction, and hope, in which and your Interest of recommending I alone shall depend tho. I must have gratitude enough to acknowledge you have already been too bountiful of yr favours to me.</p>
<p>I am very thankful to your Honour for ordering an assortment of Indian goods, which we daily find still more necessaryI shall take care while they are under my direction that they are judiciously applied in order thereto I shall be particularly careful in consulting Mssr Croghon, and Montour, by whom I shall be advisd in all Indian affairs agreeable to your Honours directions.</p>
<p>I shall wear the Medal you were pleasd to Compli[men]t me with, with great pleasure; and shall present the others to Indian Chiefs as I have already done one to the Half King. I am particularly obligd in your favour of the Rum out of your own private Store I shall allways remember my duty in drinking of it and then your Honours health can never be forgot.</p>
<p>The approbation you have expressd of my conduct has given
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0131">[131]</span>
me more pleasure than any thing wch has happend since my Imbarking in this Expedition. I am very Sensible if your Honour approves of my proceedings hitherto you will have no Reason to doubt my conduct hereafter; for I assure you Sir I have expected nothing but your disapprobation; such unfortunate circumstances have Intervend to Eclipse, or Cloud the Face of things and turn them to my disadvantage: and now I shall not have it in my power to convince yr Honr, my Friends, and Country of my diligence, and application to the Art Military, as a Head will soon arrive to whom all Honour and Glory must be given.</p>
<p>We have been extreamely ill used by Major Carlyles Deputys<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0006" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0006-ptr">6</a>; which I am heartily sorry for, as he is a Gentleman so capable of the Business himself and has taken so much pains to give satisfactionHe, I believe has been deceivd, and we have sufferd by those under him; and by those who have contracted for Provn we have been 6 Days witht Flour, and none upon the Road to our relief that we know off. though I have by repeated expresses given timely notice to have had suppliesWe have not Provisions of any sort in the Camp to serve us 2 Days th I have sent time after time acquainting therewith; once before, we shd have been 4 days witht if Providence had not sent a Trader from Ohio to our relief for whose flour I was obligd to give 21/8 pr Hundd.</p>
<p>In a late Letter to Majr Carlyle<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0007" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0007-ptr">7</a> I have complaind of the tardiness of his deputys and desird he wd accuse them therewith as I had also doneI likewise desird that suitable stores of Ammunition might be sent up speedily, for till that is done we have it not in our power to attempt any advantageous enterprise but must wait its arrival at red Stone for which I shall set of the Moment Provisions arrive to sustain on the March[.] Majr Carlyle mentiond a contract he had made with Mr Croghan for flour, likewise Mr Croghans offer of furnishing more if requird I therefore have desird to have all that Mr Croghon can furnish[.] Majr Muse with Captn Montour joind us Yesterday who brought the Wampum your Honour sent to the Half King which I presented with the Medal and Speechhe is very thankful for the notice you have taken of him therein.</p>
<p>Majr Muse brought 9 of the Swivels with some powder and Ball and this Day I have engagd 50 or 60 Horses to Bring up
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0132">[132]</span>
more of the Ball and other Stores from Wills Ck if there shd be no Provn to load them with, they have set off accordingly the Ball are to be Bt in leathr Bags made for that purpose. I hear that Captn McKay who was to have brought the Artillery is Marchd without as Waggons coud not be got to convey themI shall write to Mr Gist to procure Waggons if he is obligd to go to Pensylvania for them, to bring out the Artillery; if not, when Colo. Innis comes up we shall have nothing in readiness and shall slip this best season for action.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0008" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0008-ptr">8</a></p>
<p>Majr Carlyle acquainted me that he had agreed Colo. Fry for the place of Deputy paymaster and now proposd the same to me as the Office devolvd with the Command of the Regiment upon I hope your Honour was pleasd to countenance this as he wrote from Winchester however I returnd him no other answer than that when the Office was ascertaind to me I did not doubt but we should agree.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0009" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0009-ptr">9</a></p>
<p>I flatter myself as it was annext to the Comd your Honour will please to confirm it to me that I may give Majr Carlyle an answer accordingly. I see by the resolves of the Committee that money was to be given to Colo. Fry as Comr for paying the Regimttherefore I hope this will not be looked upon as presuming in me especially as I believe it is usual for the Colo. of every Regiment to be Paymaster.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0010" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0010-ptr">10</a> The Indians are drawing off from the River daily one of whom last Night brought News of Monacatoocha. He set of from the Logs Town abt 5 Nights ago, with the French Scalps and four Hatchets with which he intended to visit the 4 Tribes of Indians between this and Lake Irrie, and present each Tribe a scalp and Hatchet, and at the same time acquaint them that they expected as the English and Six Nations had hand in hand struck the French they would bring of their Tribes and join our Forces<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0011" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0011-ptr">11</a> This messenger likewise says, that Monacatoocha was determined not only to Council with the chiefs of those Tribes but with their great Warriours also (which is customary in these cases) and was to return as soon as possible which he imagind would be in 15 Days but in case he should not return in that time he left orders, for the Indians at Logs Town to set of for red Stone Creek and expect he had crossd the River low down (at yellow Creek)<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0012" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0012-ptr">12</a> with a party of those Indians beforementd so that they would all meet at Red Stone to join their Brothers the English He also desird there

might be no attack made against the French Fort till he should return by which time he hopd all the Forces would be gatherd and then they would make a General attack together and gain a compleat victory at once.</p>
 <p>The Half King has sent Messengers to other places for Warriours who are to meet us also at Red Stone Creek: besides these, He has sent two other messages by the advice of Mr Croghon[,] Montour and myself to envite the Shawnesse to come and receive one of their Men who was Imprisond in Carolina, and to Council with us;<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0013" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0013-ptr">13</a> that to the Delawares is for the same purpose as we hear both these Nations have accepted the Hatchet against usThis report was first brought by an Indian sent from the Logs Town to the Half Kingand since confirmd by 9 French deserters who arrivd at our Camp to Day.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0014" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0014-ptr">14</a> These Men further say that the Fort at the Forks is compleated, and proof against any attempts, but with Bombs on the Land side, there was not above 500 Men in it when they left it, but expected by this 200 more were arrivd there and 900, were orderd to follow them and might be expected in 14, or 15 Days. this I believe was more to chear the Hearts of their drooping Soldiers and amuse the Indians than anything else[.] They had in the Fort when they left it abt 2 Months Provisions and that upon the Spoil[.] As soon as I have got all the Intelligence out of these Deserters I shall send them downI was as sensibly disappointed when I met these Persons today as ever I was in my lifeby misunderstanding the Scouts that brought me Intelligence; that is mistaking 90 for 9 I marchd out at the head of 130 Men (the Majr part of effective Men in the Regiment) full with hope of procureing another present of Fh Prs for your Honour then judge my disappointment at meeting 9 only, and those coming for protection[.]<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0015" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0015-ptr">15</a> I guarded against all casualties that might happen to the Camp and orderd Colo. Muse to repair into the Fort and Erect the small Swivel which he coud do in an hours time for defence of the place. agreeable to your Honours desire I shall here mention the names of the Gentlemen who are to be promoted<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0016" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0016-ptr">16</a>Lieutt George Mercer by your Honours Comn will worthily succeed to a Captaincy(Captn Vanbraam has acted as Captn ever since we left Alexandria and an experiencd good Officer he is and very worthy the Command he has enjoyd).

Eldest Ensign which Your Honr will please to send a Lieutenancy forCaptn Stephen I have already given a Majors Commission to, finding one Blank amongst Colo. Frys Papers.</p>
<p>If merit Sir will entitle a Gentleman to your Honours notice, Mr Peyrouney may justly claim a share of your favours, his conduct has been governd by the most consummate prudence, and all his actions have sufficiently testified his readiness to serve his Country. (which I really believe he looks upon Virginia to be) He was sensibly chagrind when I acquainted him with your Honours pleasure of giving him an Ensigncy, this he has had 12 years ago, and long since Commandd a CompanyHe was prevaild on by Colo. Fry when he left Alexandria to accept the former Commission (and assist my Detachment as I had very few Officers) till we all met on Ohio which Comission he would now have resignd, and return to Virginia but for my great disswation to the Contrary: I have promisd to sollicit your Honr to appoint him Adjutant, and continue him Ensign which will induce a very good Officer to remain in the RegimentThe Office of Adjutant Sir, is the most necesy belonging to a Regiment; distributing the daily orders, receiving all reports, seeing orders executed &amp;ca in short an Adjutant is an indispensible Officer.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0017" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0017-ptr">17</a></p>
<p>If your Honour is pleasd to indulge me in this reqt I shall look upon it in a very particular light, as I think the personal merit of the Gentleman, his knowledge of Military duty, and his activity, which is requird by the Office will render him highly worthy the favour.</p>
<p>There is an Ensign still Wanting, which I hope your Honour will please to send if you know of any fitt for the Office, their is a young Man in the Camp that came with Captn Lewis who has sollicited but I am yet ignorant of his Character or qualities; he is a Volunteer and recommended by Captn Lewis.<a class="ptr" href="#GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0018" id="GEWN-02-01-02-0066-fn-0018-ptr">18</a></p>
<p>Your Honour in a Letter by Mr Ward acquainted me you had given Orders to Colo.

his gt TemedityLieutt Frazers though not altogether blameless, is much more excusable than the other, for he wd not except of the Commission till he had a promise from his Captn that he shd not reside at the Fort nor visit it above once a Week or as he saw necessary.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-top: 1em;">Since writing the foregoing, Captn McKay with the Independant Company has arrivd, who I take to be a very good sort of a Gentleman.</p>
<p>For want of proper Instructions from your Honour I am much at a loss to know how to act, or proceed in regard to his company: I made it my particular study to receive him (as it was your Honours desire) with all the Respect and politeness that was due to his Rank, or that I was capable of shewing: and dont doubt from his appearance and behavr but a strict intimacy will

I have not offerd to controul him in anything, or shewd that I claimd a superior Command, but in giving the Parrole &amp; Countersign which must be the same in an Army consisting of 10 Different Nations, to distinguish Friends from FoesHe knows the necessity of this, yet does not think he is to receive it from me.</p>
<p>Then who is to give it? am I to Issue these orders to a Company? or is an Independant Captn to prescribe Rules to the Virginia Regiment? this is the Question, but how absurd is obvious.</p>
<p>It now behooves Honble Sir that you lay your absolute commands on one or tother to obeythis is indispensably necessary for nothing clashes more with reason than to conceive our small bodys, can act distinctlywitht having connection with one another and yet be serviceable to the Publickmany incontestible Reasons may be givenamong which I shall only innumerate one or two at this timeIf I receive Intelligence of the Enemy, and have occasion to send out a Field Officers Command, which will require a proportion of his MenIt is to his choice whether he will send any or notIf he doesand it is under the Command of an Ensign or SergeantShoud my Officer and his differ abt a disposition (as it is more than possible they wd as I suppose His wd be for a Regular attack which wd expose us to almost imediate death witht hope of damageing them as the French all fight in the Indian method which by this we have got some experience in) I say if they differ in their Opinions of forming the Men the Independant party may face to the Right abt and away back so it is in regard to the whole th I dont doubt but Captn McKay is an Officer of more sense and I dare say wd do the best for the service but Sir too Commanders is so incompatible with the Service we are engagd in, that we cannot be so serviceable to one another or the Publick as we ought; and I am sincerely sorry that he has arrivd before your Honours Instructions by Colo.

<p>Captn McKay and I have livd in the most perfect harmony since his arrival and have Reasond on this calmly, and dont doubt but if we shd have occasion to exert our whole force but we shall do as well as divided authority can. We have not had the least warm disputeHe thinks your Honour has not a power to give commissions that will command himIf so I can very confidantly say his absence wd tend to the Publick advantage.

I have testified to him in the most serious manner the pleasure I shd take in consulting and advising with him upon all occasions and I am very sensible with him we shall never differ when your Honour decides this, which I am convinced your own just discernment and consideration will make appear, the impossibly of a Medm the Nature of the thing will not allow of it: It must be known who is to Command before orders will be observd, and I am very confidant your Honour will see the absurdity &amp; consider the Effects of Captn McKays having the direction of the Regiment, for it would certainly be the hardest thing in Life if we are to do double &amp; trible duty, and neither be entitled to the Pay or Rank of SoldiersThat the first Column of the Virginia Regiment has done more for the Interest of this Expedition than any Company or Corps that will hereafter arrive will be obvious to them allthis Honble Sir Captn McKay did not hesitate one moment to allow since he has seen the Work we have done upon the Roads &amp;caWe shall part tomorrowI shall continue my March to red Stone while the Company remains here but this Sir I found absolutely necessary for the Publick Interest. Captn McKay says that it is not in his power to oblige his Men to work on the Road unless he will engage them a Shilling Sterling a Day which I wd not choose to do and to suffer them to March at their ease whilst our faithful Soldiers are laboriously employd carrys an Air of such distinction that it is not to be wonderd at, if the poor fellows were to declare

<p>I hope from what has been said your honour will see the necessity of giving your speedy orders on this head. and I am sensible you will consider the Evil tendancy that will accompany Captn McKays com[mandin]g for I am sorry to observe this is what we always hopd to enjoythe Rank of Officers which to me Sir is much dearer than the Pay.</p>

Although GW does not mention it in his letter to Dinwiddie, the deserters apparently claimed that there was serious dissatisfaction among the French soldiers at Fort Duquesne and more than One Hundred Soldiers were only waiting for a favourable Opportunity to come and join us. GW then persuaded the Frenchmen to write a letter of encouragement to those of their Companions who had an Inclination to Desert and dispatched a trusty <span class="hi-italic" style="font-style: italic;">Delaware</span> to carry the letter to the fort. That his messenger was apprehended by the French is indicated by a letter of 8 Sept. 1754 from Duquesne to Contrecoeur: You see how treacherous he is, having expected he could, in trusting our nine vile deserters, make your garrison revolt, by which means they flattered themselves they could take the fort. Inform yourself, without seeming to do so, if this Delaware, who is said to have transmitted the letter to the Soldiers of your garrison, again frequents the fort (translation, <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Fernand Grenier, ed. &lt;i&gt;Papiers Contrecur et autres documents concernant le conflit anglo-franais sur lOhio de 1745  1756&lt;/i&gt;.

   <p>Dinwiddie asked for GWs recommendations for promotion on 4 June. On 27 June Dinwiddie wrote that he had left the Appointmts to Colo. Innes. On 20 Aug., more than a month after the capitulation at Fort Necessity, GW wrote Dinwiddie: Colo.

   <p>Andrew Lewis (17201781), captain in the Virginia Regiment, came to the Virginia frontier from Ireland in 1732. He commanded a company at
<span class="pb" title="page number in print edition (no page scan available)" id="GEWN-02-01-02-pb-0140">[140]</span>
Fort Necessity and was present at its capitulation. During Braddocks campaign, Lewis served on the Augusta County frontier. When GW reorganized the new Virginia Regiment after Braddocks defeat, he made Lewis the major of the regiment. He served with GW in the regiment until he was captured in James Grants attack on Fort Duquesne in Sept. 1758. After the war he became a leading citizen of the new county of Botetourt in western Virginia. Lewis led the colonys forces in the battle with the Indians at Point Pleasant in 1774 and served for a time as a brigadier general in Virginias Revolutionary forces before resigning in 1777.</p>

   <p>Canachquasy, or Captain New Castle (d. 1756), is generally reputed to be the son of Queen Alliquippa (d. 1754) of the Seneca, whom GW had visited in 1753 on his journey to the French commandant. Canachquasy had brought news of French activities on the frontier to the Pennsylvania Provincial Council in 1747. For the next 7 years he attended a number of councils between the colonial government and the Indians and was a steadfast friend to the British.</p>

   <p>This was probably Philippe Thomas de Joncaire, sieur de Chabert (1707c.1766), captain of marines in the French army, who was among the most adroit of Indian negotiators. In 1739 he became French agent to the Iroquois and in 1749 accompanied Cloron in his exploration of the Ohio country. GW had encountered him in 1753 in his journey to the French commandant. See <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig, eds. &lt;i&gt;The Diaries of George Washington&lt;/i&gt;. 6 vols.
