   <p>Christopher Hardwick had recently been replaced as GWs overseer at his Bullskin plantation. See <a href="default.xqy?keys=GEWN-print-02-07-02-0088" class="document">Agreement with Edward Violet, 5 Aug. 1762.</a> The joint venture of GW and Hardwick to develop a plantation on GWs 240acre tract in Hampshire County seems to have come to naught. In August 1763 GW let Hardwick have a slave named Troy for 65, and on 26 Sept. 1763 there was a final settlement of the account between the two men. See <span class="ref-st" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ Manuscript Ledger Book 1, 1750-72, in George Washington Papers, Library of Congress. ]">Ledger A</span>, 91 and 138. GWs original grant of this land in the Northern Neck proprietary was made on 8 Mar. 1753, and a regrant of the same tract on 13 April 1753, with a slight difference in the lines (Northern Neck Grants, Book H [175156], 255, 287). An undated plotting of the lines of the earlier tract in GWs hand is in <span class="ref-rep" title="fade=[ on ] fadespeed=[0.1] windowlock=[on] cssbody=[ boxover ] header=[]  body=[ U.S. Library of Congress, George Washington Papers, Washington, D.C. ]">DLC:GW</span>. Perhaps GW ran the lines of his new grant in the early spring of 1753 and, discovering an error in the plotting, had the tract regranted.</p>

   <p>GW became seriously interested in the cultivation of hemp in 1765 as one of the crops to replace the cultivation of tobacco at Mount Vernon, which he became determined to do.
